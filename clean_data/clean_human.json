    "title": "CS-SHRED: Enhancing SHRED for Robust Recovery of Spatiotemporal Dynamics",
    "summary": "We present CS-SHRED, a novel deep learning architecture that integrates Compressed Sensing (CS) into a Shallow Recurrent Decoder (SHRED) to reconstruct spatiotemporal dynamics from incomplete, compressed, or corrupted data. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, by incorporating CS techniques into the SHRED architecture, our method leverages a batch-based forward framework with regularization to robustly recover signals even in scenarios with sparse sensor placements, noisy measurements, and incomplete sensor acquisitions. Second, an adaptive loss function dynamically combines Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) terms with a piecewise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regularization, which suppresses noise and outliers in low-SNR regions while preserving fine-scale features in high-SNR regions. We validate CS-SHRED on challenging problems including viscoelastic fluid flows, maximum specific humidity fields, sea surface temperature distributions, and rotating turbulent flows. Compared to the traditional SHRED approach, CS-SHRED achieves significantly higher reconstruction fidelity -- as demonstrated by improved SSIM and PSNR values, lower normalized errors, and enhanced LPIPS scores-thereby providing superior preservation of small-scale structures and increased robustness against noise and outliers. Our results underscore the advantages of the jointly trained CS and SHRED design architecture which includes an LSTM sequence model for characterizing the temporal evolution with a shallow decoder network (SDN) for modeling the high-dimensional state space. The SNR-guided adaptive loss function for the spatiotemporal data recovery establishes CS-SHRED as a promising tool for a wide range of applications in environmental, climatic, and scientific data analyses."

    "title": "Stability of Modified-CS and LS-CS for Recursive Reconstruction of Sparse Signal Sequences",
    "summary": "In this work, we obtain sufficient conditions for the \"stability\" of our recently proposed algorithms, Least Squares Compressive Sensing residual (LS-CS) and modified-CS, for recursively reconstructing sparse signal sequences from noisy measurements. By \"stability\" we mean that the number of misses from the current support estimate and the number of extras in it remain bounded by a time-invariant value at all times. We show that, for a signal model with fixed signal power and support set size; support set changes allowed at every time; and gradual coefficient magnitude increase/decrease, \"stability\" holds under mild assumptions -- bounded noise, high enough minimum nonzero coefficient magnitude increase rate, and large enough number of measurements at every time. A direct corollary is that the reconstruction error is also bounded by a time-invariant value at all times. If the support set of the sparse signal sequence changes slowly over time, our results hold under weaker assumptions than what simple compressive sensing (CS) needs for the same error bound. Also, our support error bounds are small compared to the support size. Our discussion is backed up by Monte Carlo simulation based comparisons."

    "summary": "Providing computer science (CS) offerings in the K-12 education system is often limited by the lack of experienced teachers, especially in small or rural underserved school districts. By helping teachers in underserved areas develop CS curriculum and helping them become certified to teach CS courses, more young people in underserved areas are aware of IT-career opportunities, and prepared for CS education at the university level, which ultimately helps tackle the IT workforce deficit in the United States. This paper discusses a successful implementation of a Google CS4HS grant to a rural underserved area, as well as lessons learned through the implementation of the program. Key elements in the implementation included a face-to-face hands-on workshop, followed by a seven week graduate-level online summer course for the teachers to learn and develop curriculum that covers the CS concepts they will be teaching. The teachers were supported with an online community of practice for the year as they implemented the curriculum."

    "title": "CS reconstruction of the speech and musical signals",
    "summary": "The application of Compressive sensing approach to the speech and musical signals is considered in this paper. Compressive sensing (CS) is a new approach to the signal sampling that allows signal reconstruction from a small set of randomly acquired samples. This method is developed for the signals that exhibit the sparsity in a certain domain. Here we have observed two sparsity domains: discrete Fourier and discrete cosine transform domain. Furthermore, two different types of audio signals are analyzed in terms of sparsity and CS performance - musical and speech signals. Comparative analysis of the CS reconstruction using different number of signal samples is performed in the two domains of sparsity. It is shown that the CS can be successfully applied to both, musical and speech signals, but the speech signals are more demanding in terms of the number of observations. Also, our results show that discrete cosine transform domain allows better reconstruction using lower number of observations, compared to the Fourier transform domain, for both types of signals."

This antiferromagnetic order is driven by the Se-bridged antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions between Fe moments. Similarly, we find that crystals AFe Se (A=K, Rb, or Cs) are also antiferromagnetic semiconductors but with a zero-gap semiconducting state or semimetallic state nearly degenerated with the ground states. Thus rich physical properties and phase diagrams are expected."

    "summary": "We consider the problem of recursively and causally reconstructing time sequences of sparse signals (with unknown and time-varying sparsity patterns) from a limited number of noisy linear measurements. The sparsity pattern is assumed to change slowly with time. The idea of our proposed solution, LS-CS-residual (LS-CS), is to replace compressed sensing (CS) on the observation by CS on the least squares (LS) residual computed using the previous estimate of the support. We bound CS-residual error and show that when the number of available measurements is small, the bound is much smaller than that on CS error if the sparsity pattern changes slowly enough. We also obtain conditions for \"stability\" of LS-CS over time for a signal model that allows support additions and removals, and that allows coefficients to gradually increase (decrease) until they reach a constant value (become zero). By \"stability\", we mean that the number of misses and extras in the support estimate remain bounded by time-invariant values (in turn implying a time-invariant bound on LS-CS error). The concept is meaningful only if the bounds are small compared to the support size. Numerical experiments backing our claims are shown."

CS-Sum is the first benchmark for CS dialogue summarization across Mandarin-English (EN-ZH), Tamil-English (EN-TA), and Malay-English (EN-MS), with 900-1300 human-annotated dialogues per language pair. Evaluating ten LLMs, including open and closed-source models, we analyze performance across few-shot, translate-summarize, and fine-tuning (LoRA, QLoRA on synthetic data) approaches. Our findings show that though the scores on automated metrics are high, LLMs make subtle mistakes that alter the complete meaning of the dialogue. To this end, we introduce 3 most common type of errors that LLMs make when handling CS input. Error rates vary across CS pairs and LLMs, with some LLMs showing more frequent errors on certain language pairs, underscoring the need for specialized training on code-switched data."

However, the current community of LLMs overly focuses on benchmarks for analyzing specific foundational skills (e.g. mathematics and code generation), neglecting an all-round evaluation of the computer science field. To bridge this gap, we introduce CS-Bench, the first multilingual (English, Chinese, French, German) benchmark dedicated to evaluating the performance of LLMs in computer science. CS-Bench comprises approximately 10K meticulously curated test samples, covering 26 subfields across 4 key areas of computer science, encompassing various task forms and divisions of knowledge and reasoning. Utilizing CS-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of over 30 mainstream LLMs, revealing the relationship between CS performance and model scales. We also quantitatively analyze the reasons for failures in existing LLMs and highlight directions for improvements, including knowledge supplementation and CS-specific reasoning. Further cross-capability experiments show a high correlation between LLMs' capabilities in computer science and their abilities in mathematics and coding. Moreover, expert LLMs specialized in mathematics and coding also demonstrate strong performances in several CS subfields. Looking ahead, we envision CS-Bench serving as a cornerstone for LLM applications in the CS field and paving new avenues in assessing LLMs' diverse reasoning capabilities.

Our contributions include developing MedQA-CS, a comprehensive evaluation framework with publicly available data and expert annotations, and providing the quantitative and qualitative assessment of LLMs as reliable judges in CS evaluation. Our experiments show that MedQA-CS is a more challenging benchmark for evaluating clinical skills than traditional multiple-choice QA benchmarks (e.g., MedQA). Combined with existing benchmarks, MedQA-CS enables a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' clinical capabilities for both open- and closed-source LLMs."

The multiwavelength data characterise ISOSS 20246+6541 as a representative of a class of globules which has not been discovered so far due to their small angular size and low 100 m brightness. A significant overabundance of CO is found . This is likely due to isotope selective chemical processes."

However, most research in justice-centered approaches in CS education focus on K-12 learning environments. In this position paper, we review justice-centered approaches to CS education, problematize the lack of justice-centered approaches to CS in higher education in particular, and describe a justice-centered approach for undergraduate Data Structures and Algorithms. Our approach emphasizes three components: (1) ethics: critiques the sociopolitical values of data structure and algorithm design as well as the underlying logics of dominant computing culture; (2) identity: draws on culturally responsive-sustaining pedagogies to emphasize student identity as rooted in resistance to the dominant computing culture; and (3) political vision: ensures the rightful presence of political struggles by reauthoring rights to frame CS learning as a force for social justice. Through a case study of this Critical Comparative Data Structures and Algorithms pedagogy, we argue that justice-centered approaches to higher CS education can help all computing students not only learn about the ethical implications of nominally technical concepts, but also develop greater respect for diverse epistemologies, cultures, and experiences surrounding computing that are essential to creating the socially-just worlds we need."

    "title": "CS-Rep: Making Speaker Verification Networks Embracing Re-parameterization",
    "summary": "Automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems, which determine whether two speeches are from the same speaker, mainly focus on verification accuracy while ignoring inference speed. However, in real applications, both inference speed and verification accuracy are essential. This study proposes cross-sequential re-parameterization (CS-Rep), a novel topology re-parameterization strategy for multi-type networks, to increase the inference speed and verification accuracy of models. CS-Rep solves the problem that existing re-parameterization methods are unsuitable for typical ASV backbones. When a model applies CS-Rep, the training-period network utilizes a multi-branch topology to capture speaker information, whereas the inference-period model converts to a time-delay neural network (TDNN)-like plain backbone with stacked TDNN layers to achieve the fast inference speed. Based on CS-Rep, an improved TDNN with friendly test and deployment called Rep-TDNN is proposed. Compared with the state-of-the-art model ECAPA-TDNN, which is highly recognized in the industry, Rep-TDNN increases the actual inference speed by about 50% and reduces the EER by 10%. The code will be released."

    "summary": "Community Search (CS) is one of the fundamental tasks in network science and has attracted much attention due to its ability to discover personalized communities with a wide range of applications. Given any query nodes, CS seeks to find a densely connected subgraph containing query nodes. Most existing approaches usually study networks with a single type of proximity between nodes, which defines a single view of a network. However, in many applications such as biological, social, and transportation networks, interactions between objects span multiple aspects, yielding networks with multiple views, called multiplex networks. Existing CS approaches in multiplex networks adopt pre-defined subgraph patterns to model the communities, which cannot find communities that do not have such pre-defined patterns in real-world networks. In this paper, we propose a query-driven graph convolutional network in multiplex networks, CS-MLGCN, that can capture flexible community structures by learning from the ground-truth communities in a data-driven fashion. CS-MLGCN first combines the local query-dependent structure and global graph embedding in each type of proximity and then uses an attention mechanism to incorporate information on different types of relations. Experiments on real-world graphs with ground-truth communities validate the quality of the solutions we obtain and the efficiency of our model."

    "summary": "Neural networks (NNs), with their powerful nonlinear mapping and end-to-end capabilities, are widely applied in mechanical intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD). However, as typical black-box models, they pose challenges in understanding their decision basis and logic, limiting their deployment in high-reliability scenarios. Hence, various methods have been proposed to enhance the interpretability of IFD. Among these, post-hoc approaches can provide explanations without changing model architecture, preserving its flexibility and scalability. However, existing post-hoc methods often suffer from limitations in explanation forms. They either require preprocessing that disrupts the end-to-end nature or overlook fault mechanisms, leading to suboptimal explanations. To address these issues, we derived the cyclic-spectral (CS) transform and proposed the CS-SHAP by extending Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to the CS domain. CS-SHAP can evaluate contributions from both carrier and modulation frequencies, aligning more closely with fault mechanisms and delivering clearer and more accurate explanations. Three datasets are utilized to validate the superior interpretability of CS-SHAP, ensuring its correctness, reproducibility, and practical performance. With open-source code and outstanding interpretability, CS-SHAP has the potential to be widely adopted and become the post-hoc interpretability benchmark in IFD, even in other classification tasks.

    "summary": "Despite the increasing adoption of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) in compute clouds, there remains a significant gap in programming tools and abstractions which can leverage network-connected, cloud-scale, multi-die FPGAs to generate accelerators with high frequency and throughput. To this end, we propose TAPA-CS, a task-parallel dataflow programming framework which automatically partitions and compiles a large design across a cluster of FPGAs with no additional user effort while achieving high frequency and throughput. TAPA-CS has three main contributions. First, it is an open-source framework which allows users to leverage virtually \"unlimited\" accelerator fabric, high-bandwidth memory (HBM), and on-chip memory, by abstracting away the underlying hardware. This reduces the user's programming burden to a logical one, enabling software developers and researchers with limited FPGA domain knowledge to deploy larger designs than possible earlier. Second, given as input a large design, TAPA-CS automatically partitions the design to map to multiple FPGAs, while ensuring congestion control, resource balancing, and overlapping of communication and computation. Third, TAPA-CS couples coarse-grained floorplanning with automated interconnect pipelining at the inter- and intra-FPGA levels to ensure high frequency. We have tested TAPA-CS on our multi-FPGA testbed where the FPGAs communicate through a high-speed 100Gbps Ethernet infrastructure. We have evaluated the performance and scalability of our tool on designs, including systolic-array based convolutional neural networks (CNNs), graph processing workloads such as page rank, stencil applications like the Dilate kernel, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). TAPA-CS has the potential to accelerate development of increasingly complex and large designs on the low power and reconfigurable FPGAs."

The ground surface representation introduced in this paper, in comparison to its uni-planar counterparts (methods that model the surface of a whole 3D scene using single plane), is far more accurate while being ~10x faster. The novelty of the ground representation lies both in the way in which the ground surface of the scene is represented in Lidar perception problems, as well as in the (cost-efficient) way in which it is computed. Furthermore, the proposed object detection pipeline builds on the traditional two-stage object detection models by incorporating the ability to dynamically reason the surface of the scene, ultimately achieving a new state-of-the-art 3D object detection performance among the two-stage Lidar Object Detection pipelines."

In this paper we present cs-romer: a novel object-oriented compressed sensing framework to reconstruct Faraday depth signals from spectro-polarization radio data. Unlike previous compressed sensing applications, this framework is designed to work directly with data that are irregularly sampled in wavelength-squared space and to incorporate multiple forms of compressed sensing regularisation. We demonstrate the framework using simulated data for the VLA telescope under a variety of observing conditions, and we introduce a methodology for identifying the optimal basis function for reconstruction of these data, using an approach that can also be applied to datasets from other telescopes and over different frequency ranges. In this work we show that the delta basis function provides optimal reconstruction for VLA L-band data and we use this basis with observations of the low-mass galaxy cluster Abell 1314 in order to reconstruct the Faraday depth of its constituent cluster galaxies. We use the cs-romer framework to de-rotate the Galactic Faraday depth contribution directly from the wavelength-squared data and to handle the spectral behaviour of different radio sources in a direction-dependent manner. The results of this analysis show that individual galaxies within Abell 1314 deviate from the behaviour expected for a Faraday-thin screen such as the intra-cluster medium and instead suggest that the Faraday rotation exhibited by these galaxies is dominated by their local environments."

The first two introductory courses for majors, each taught by one faculty instructor and several hundred student teachers, combine to serve nearly 2,900 students per term. This report presents three strategies that have enabled the effective teaching, delivery, and management of large-scale CS courses: (1) the development of autograder infrastructure and online platforms to provide instant feedback with minimal instructor intervention and deliver the course at scale; (2) the expansion of academic and social student support networks resulting from changes in teaching assistant responsibilities and the development of several near-peer mentoring communities; and (3) the expansion of undergraduate teacher preparation programs to meet the increased demand for qualified student teachers. These interventions have helped both introductory and advanced courses address capacity challenges and expand enrollments while receiving among the highest student evaluations of teaching in department history.

However, if the support size of the outliers becomes too large, for a given dimension of the current PC space, then the number of \"measurements\" available for CS may become too small.

    "summary": "Deep learning has been applied to compressive sensing (CS) of images successfully in recent years. However, existing network-based methods are often trained as the black box, in which the lack of prior knowledge is often the bottleneck for further performance improvement. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes a novel CS method using non-local prior which combines the interpretability of the traditional optimization methods with the speed of network-based methods, called NL-CS Net. We unroll each phase from iteration of the augmented Lagrangian method solving non-local and sparse regularized optimization problem by a network. NL-CS Net is composed of the up-sampling module and the recovery module. In the up-sampling module, we use learnable up-sampling matrix instead of a predefined one. In the recovery module, patch-wise non-local network is employed to capture long-range feature correspondences. Important parameters involved (e.g. sampling matrix, nonlinear transforms, shrinkage thresholds, step size, ) are learned end-to-end, rather than hand-crafted. Furthermore, to facilitate practical implementation, orthogonal and binary constraints on the sampling matrix are simultaneously adopted. Extensive experiments on natural images and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods while maintaining great interpretability and speed."

    "summary": "There is consensus regarding the relevance of including Computer Science (CS) in official school curricula. However, this discipline cannot be taught on a large scale until there are enough trained teachers who can effectively lead a class. In this article, we discuss the results of a 400-hour teacher training program conducted in Argentina aimed at K-12 teachers with no CS background. The only requirement to sign up was to be an in-service teacher, and therefore there were a plethora of different teacher profiles that attended the courses. Our research aims at understanding whether a single teacher training program can be effective in teaching CS contents and specific pedagogy to teachers with very heterogeneous profiles. Also, we investigate what teachers expect to do with the contents they learn. To assess these questions anonymous examinations and questionnaires were given and interviews were conducted with course attendees. Even though the majority reached the expected minimum bar regarding CS contents and pedagogy, significant differences appear in their self-perception as regards career opportunities in CS teaching. Our conclusion is that carrying out CS teacher training for a broad spectrum of profiles may be effective for promoting CS contents. However, if the goal is to boost teachers' confidence in teaching a CS subject, then having a program which focuses on a more restricted selection of profiles would be a better strategy."

    "title": "CS-Dialogue: A 104-Hour Dataset of Spontaneous Mandarin-English Code-Switching Dialogues for Speech Recognition",
    "summary": "Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a single conversation, presents significant challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Existing Mandarin-English code-switching datasets often suffer from limitations in size, spontaneity, and the lack of full-length dialogue recordings with transcriptions, hindering the development of robust ASR models for real-world conversational scenarios. This paper introduces CS-Dialogue, a novel large-scale Mandarin-English code-switching speech dataset comprising 104 hours of spontaneous conversations from 200 speakers. Unlike previous datasets, CS-Dialogue provides full-length dialogue recordings with complete transcriptions, capturing naturalistic code-switching patterns in continuous speech. We describe the data collection and annotation processes, present detailed statistics of the dataset, and establish benchmark ASR performance using state-of-the-art models. Our experiments, using Transformer, Conformer, and Branchformer, demonstrate the challenges of code-switching ASR, and show that existing pre-trained models such as Whisper still have the space to improve. The CS-Dialogue dataset will be made freely available for all academic purposes."

We provide estimates of line fluxes from the CS(1-0) to the CS(15-14) transitions and present the temporal variation of these fluxes. We find that i) the CS(1-0) transition is a better tracer of the Envelope of the hot core whereas the higher-J CS lines trace the ultra-compact core; ii) the peak temperature of the CS transitions is a good indicator of the temperature inside the hot core; iii) in the Envelope, the older the hot core the stronger the self-absorption of CS; iv) the fractional abundance of CS is highest in the innermost parts of the ultra-compact core, confirming the CS molecule as one of the best tracers of very dense gas."

Thus, there is necessary to explore viewers' comments with scenes in E-sport live-streaming events. In this paper, we developed CS-lol, a new large-scale dataset containing comments from viewers paired with descriptions of game scenes in E-sports live-streaming. Moreover, we propose a task, namely viewer comment retrieval, to retrieve the viewer comments for the scene of the live-streaming event. Results on a series of baseline retrieval methods derived from typical IR evaluation methods show our task as a challenging task. Finally, we release CS-lol and baseline implementation to the research community as a resource."

    "summary": "For at least 40 years, there has been debate and disagreement as to the role of mathematics in the computer science curriculum. This paper presents the results of an analysis of the math requirements of 199 Computer Science BS/BA degrees from 158 U.S. universities, looking not only at which math courses are required, but how they are used as prerequisites (and corequisites) for computer science (CS) courses. Our analysis shows that while there is consensus that discrete math is critical for a CS degree, and further that calculus is almost always required for the BS in CS, there is little consensus as to when a student should have mastered these subjects. Based on our analysis of how math requirements impact access, retention and on-time degree completion for the BS and the BA in CS, we provide several recommendations for CS departments to consider."

    "title": "CS Depletion in Prestellar Cores",
    "summary": "The CS molecule is known to be absorbed onto dust in the cold and dense conditions, causing it to get significantly depleted in the central region of cores. This study is aimed to investigate the depletion of the CS molecule using the optically thin C S molecular line observations. We mapped five prestellar cores, L1544, L1552, L1689B, L694-2, and L1197 using two molecular lines, C S and N H with the NRO 45-m telescope, doubling the number of cores where the CS depletion was probed using C S. In most of our targets, the distribution of C S emission shows features that suggest that the CS molecule is generally depleted in the center of the prestellar cores. The radial profile of the CS abundance with respect to H directly measured from the CS emission and the Herschel dust emission indicates that the CS molecule is depleted by a factor of 3 toward the central regions of the cores with respect to their outer regions. The degree of the depletion is found to be even more enhanced by an order of magnitude when the contaminating effect introduced by the presence of CS molecules in the surrounding envelope that lie along the line-of-sight is removed. Except for L1197 which is classified as relatively the least evolved core in our targets based on its observed physical parameters, we found that the remaining four prestellar cores are suffering from significant CS depletion at their central region regardless of the relative difference in their evolutionary status."

    "title": "\"Computer Science for all\": Concepts to engage teenagers and non-CS students in technology",
    "summary": "Knowledge in Computer Science (CS) is essential, and companies have increased their demands for CS professionals. Despite this, many jobs remain unfilled. Furthermore, employees with computational thinking (CT) skills are required, even if they are not actual technicians. Moreover, the gender disparity in technology related fields is a serious problem. Even if companies want to hire women in technology, the number of women who enter these fields is remarkably low. In high schools, most teenagers acquire only low-level skills in CS. Thus, they may never understand the fundamental concepts of CS, have unrealistic expectations or preconceptions, and are influenced by stereotype-based expectations. Consequently, many teenagers exclude computing as a career path. In this research study, we present two promising concepts to overcome these challenges. First, we consider alternative paths to enter the field of CS. In 2018, a voluntary lecture \"Design your own app\" at the University of Graz for students of all degree programs was introduced. In total, 202 students participated. We applied a Game Development-Based Learning (GDBL) approach with the visual coding tool Pocket Code, a mobile app developed at Graz University of Technology. The students were supposed to create simple games directly on smartphones. The course received positive evaluations and led to our second concept; In January 2019, we started to design a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) with the title \"Get FIT in Computer Science\". First, this course can be used to encourage young women who have little to no previous knowledge in CS. Second, it should help all teenagers to get a more realistic picture of CS to its basic concepts. Third, teachers can use the course materials to lead high school classes (Open Educational Resources). Finally, the MOOC can be accessed by everyone interested in this topic."

    "summary": "Over the past year, there has been a notable rise in the use of large language models (LLMs) for academic research and industrial practices within the cybersecurity field. However, it remains a lack of comprehensive and publicly accessible benchmarks to evaluate the performance of LLMs on cybersecurity tasks. To address this gap, we introduce CS-Eval, a publicly accessible, comprehensive and bilingual LLM benchmark specifically designed for cybersecurity. CS-Eval synthesizes the research hotspots from academia and practical applications from industry, curating a diverse set of high-quality questions across 42 categories within cybersecurity, systematically organized into three cognitive levels: knowledge, ability, and application. Through an extensive evaluation of a wide range of LLMs using CS-Eval, we have uncovered valuable insights. For instance, while GPT-4 generally excels overall, other models may outperform it in certain specific subcategories. Additionally, by conducting evaluations over several months, we observed significant improvements in many LLMs' abilities to solve cybersecurity tasks. The benchmarks are now publicly available at https://github.com/CS-EVAL/CS-Eval."

    "summary": "The compact radio frequency negative ion source NIO1 (Negative Ion Optimization phase 1) has been designed, built and operated by Consorzio RFX and INFN-LNL in order to study and optimize the production and acceleration of H- ions in continuous operation. In 2020 Cs was evaporated in the source to increase the total extracted ion current. After an initial reduction of extracted electron to ion ratio and subsequently an increase of extracted negative ion current, the source performances progressively worsened, because of the excessive amount of Cs evaporated in the source; the extracted electron to ion ratio increased from below 1 to more than 10, while ion current density reduced from max. 67 A/m2 ion current to not more than 30 A/m2). The paper presents the experimental observations collected during Cs evaporation (reduction of plasma light, Cs emission and H /H ratio, etc.) that can help stopping the process before an excessive amount of Cs is introduced in the source. The paper also reports the cleaning techniques tested to remove the Cs excess by the action of hydrogen or argon plasmas; while argon was predictably more effective in surface sputtering, a 3 h Ar plasma treatment was not sufficient to recover from overcesiation."

The method of Ion-Laser InterAction Mass Spectrometry (ILIAMS) for barium separation at the Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator (VERA) was investigated and further improved for low abundance cesium detection. The difluorides BaF and CsF differ in their electron detachment energies and make isobar suppression with ILIAMS by more than 7 orders of magnitude possible. By this method, samples with ratios down to the order of Cs/ Cs are measurable and the Cs/ Cs ratios of first environmental samples were determined by AMS."

    "summary": "The growth and permeation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies across society has drawn focus to the ways in which the responsible use of these technologies can be facilitated through AI governance. Increasingly, large companies and governments alike have begun to articulate and, in some cases, enforce governance preferences through AI policy. Yet existing literature documents an unwieldy heterogeneity in ethical principles for AI governance, while our own prior research finds that discussions of the implications of AI policy are not yet present in the computer science (CS) curriculum. In this context, overlapping jurisdictions and even contradictory policy preferences across private companies, local, national, and multinational governments create a complex landscape for AI policy which, we argue, will require AI developers able adapt to an evolving regulatory environment. Preparing computing students for the new challenges of an AI-dominated technology industry is therefore a key priority for the CS curriculum. In this discussion paper, we seek to articulate a framework for integrating discussions on the nascent AI policy landscape into computer science courses. We begin by summarizing recent AI policy efforts in the United States and European Union. Subsequently, we propose guiding questions to frame class discussions around AI policy in technical and non-technical (e.g., ethics) CS courses. Throughout, we emphasize the connection between normative policy demands and still-open technical challenges relating to their implementation and enforcement through code and governance structures. This paper therefore represents a valuable contribution towards bridging research and discussions across the areas of AI policy and CS education, underlining the need to prepare AI engineers to interact with and adapt to societal policy preferences."

Dual-species evaporation is performed in a bichromatic optical dipole trap that combines light at 1070 nm and 532 nm to enable control of the relative trap depths for Cs and Yb. Maintaining a trap which is shallower for Yb throughout the evaporation leads to highly efficient sympathetic cooling of Cs for both isotopic combinations at magnetic fields close to the Efimov minimum in the Cs three-body recombination rate at around 22 G. For Cs + Yb, we produce quantum mixtures with typical atom numbers of and . We find that the attractive interspecies interaction (characterised by the scattering length ) is stabilised by the repulsive intraspecies interactions. For Cs + Yb, we produce quantum mixtures with typical atom numbers of , and . Here, the repulsive interspecies interaction ( ) can overwhelm the intraspecies interactions, such that the mixture sits in a region of partial miscibility."

Although compressed sensing magnetic resonance imaging (CS-MRI) has been studied to accelerate MRI by reducing k-space measurements, in current CS-MRI techniques MRI applications such as segmentation are overlooked when doing image reconstruction. In this paper, we test the utility of CS-MRI methods in automatic segmentation models and propose a unified deep neural network architecture called SegNetMRI which we apply to the combined CS-MRI reconstruction and segmentation problem. SegNetMRI is built upon a MRI reconstruction network with multiple cascaded blocks each containing an encoder-decoder unit and a data fidelity unit, and MRI segmentation networks having the same encoder-decoder structure. The two subnetworks are pre-trained and fine-tuned with shared reconstruction encoders. The outputs are merged into the final segmentation. Our experiments show that SegNetMRI can improve both the reconstruction and segmentation performance when using compressive measurements."

    "title": "Understanding the Effects of Using Parsons Problems to Scaffold Code Writing for Students with Varying CS Self-Efficacy Levels",
    "summary": "Introductory programming courses aim to teach students to write code independently. However, transitioning from studying worked examples to generating their own code is often difficult and frustrating for students, especially those with lower CS self-efficacy in general. Therefore, we investigated the impact of using Parsons problems as a code-writing scaffold for students with varying levels of CS self-efficacy. Parsons problems are programming tasks where students arrange mixed-up code blocks in the correct order. We conducted a between-subjects study with undergraduate students (N=89) on a topic where students have limited code-writing expertise. Students were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. Students in one condition practiced writing code without any scaffolding, while students in the other condition were provided with scaffolding in the form of an equivalent Parsons problem. We found that, for students with low CS self-efficacy levels, those who received scaffolding achieved significantly higher practice performance and in-practice problem-solving efficiency compared to those without any scaffolding. Furthermore, when given Parsons problems as scaffolding during practice, students with lower CS self-efficacy were more likely to solve them. In addition, students with higher pre-practice knowledge on the topic were more likely to effectively use the Parsons scaffolding. This study provides evidence for the benefits of using Parsons problems to scaffold students' write-code activities. It also has implications for optimizing the Parsons scaffolding experience for students, including providing personalized and adaptive Parsons problems based on the student's current problem-solving status."

If and are two different states, our results show that is the pure state, and the SU(3) flavor partner of is rather than the . Another two important consequences are the existence of a tensor resonance with mass about 4126 MeV and width 13 MeV, and the suppression of the decay mode . The two consequences can be tested in experiments and distinguish the two-state interpretation from the one-state scheme."

Moreover, if the state can be explained as the mixed state indeed, the partial decay width ratio between and is close to unit, which indicates the decay channel may be a ideal channel as well to decode the inner structure of .

    "title": "Handwritten Code Recognition for Pen-and-Paper CS Education",
    "summary": "Teaching Computer Science (CS) by having students write programs by hand on paper has key pedagogical advantages: It allows focused learning and requires careful thinking compared to the use of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) with intelligent support tools or \"just trying things out\". The familiar environment of pens and paper also lessens the cognitive load of students with no prior experience with computers, for whom the mere basic usage of computers can be intimidating. Finally, this teaching approach opens learning opportunities to students with limited access to computers. However, a key obstacle is the current lack of teaching methods and support software for working with and running handwritten programs. Optical character recognition (OCR) of handwritten code is challenging: Minor OCR errors, perhaps due to varied handwriting styles, easily make code not run, and recognizing indentation is crucial for languages like Python but is difficult to do due to inconsistent horizontal spacing in handwriting. Our approach integrates two innovative methods. The first combines OCR with an indentation recognition module and a language model designed for post-OCR error correction without introducing hallucinations. This method, to our knowledge, surpasses all existing systems in handwritten code recognition. It reduces error from 30\\% in the state of the art to 5\\% with minimal hallucination of logical fixes to student programs. The second method leverages a multimodal language model to recognize handwritten programs in an end-to-end fashion. We hope this contribution can stimulate further pedagogical research and contribute to the goal of making CS education universally accessible.

The ``known\" part of the support, denoted T, may be available from prior knowledge. Alternatively, in a problem of recursively reconstructing time sequences of sparse spatial signals, one may use the support estimate from the previous time instant as the ``known\" part. The idea of our proposed solution (modified-CS) is to solve a convex relaxation of the following problem: find the signal that satisfies the data constraint and is sparsest outside of T. We obtain sufficient conditions for exact reconstruction using modified-CS. These are much weaker than those needed for compressive sensing (CS) when the sizes of the unknown part of the support and of errors in the known part are small compared to the support size. An important extension called Regularized Modified-CS (RegModCS) is developed which also uses prior signal estimate knowledge. Simulation comparisons for both sparse and compressible signals are shown."

In addition, we produce ultracold fermionic Cs Yb and bosonic Cs Yb and Cs Yb molecules. From mass scaling, we determine the number of bound states supported by the 2(1/2) excited-state potential to be 154 or 155."

Convolu- tional neural network can realize fast processing while achieving compa- rable results. While CS image recovery with high quality not only de- pends on good reconstruction algorithms, but also good measurements.

The fully-connected layer which has low-dimension output acts as measurement. We train the fully-connected layer and ReconNet simultaneously and obtain adaptive measurement. Because the adaptive measurement fits dataset better, in contrast with random Gaussian measurement matrix, under the same measuremen- t rate, it can extract the information of scene more efficiently and get better reconstruction results. Experiments show that the new network outperforms the original one."

Due to the sparsity of the targets in space-velocity domain, we can exploit Compressive Sensing (CS) to improve the performance of MIMO radars when the sampling rate is much less than the Nyquist rate. In distributed MIMO radars, block CS methods can be used instead of classical CS ones for more performance improvement, because the received signal in this group of MIMO radars is a block sparse signal in a basis. In this paper, two new methods are proposed to improve the performance of the block CS-based distributed MIMO radars. The first one is a new method for optimal energy allocation to the transmitters, and the other one is a new method for optimal design of the measurement matrix. These methods are based on the minimization of an upper bound of the sensing matrix block-coherence. Simulation results show an increase in the accuracy of multiple targets parameters estimation for both proposed methods."

With regards to this algorithm, the effect of signal subspace deviation under low snapshot scenario (e.g. target tracking) is analysed. The CS beamformer greatly reduces computational complexity without affecting resolution of the algorithm, works on par with root-MUSIC under low snapshot scenario and also, gives an option of non-uniform linear array sensors unlike the case of root-MUSIC algorithm. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated with simulations under various scenarios."

PPDs also present an interesting test bed for sulfur chemistry models, since each disk present a diverse set of environments. In this context, we present new sulfur molecule observations in PPDs, and new S-disk chemistry models. With ALMA we observed the CS 5-4 rotational transition toward five PPDs (DM Tau, DO Tau, CI Tau, LkCa 15, MWC 480), and the CS 6-5 transition toward three PPDs (LkCa 15, MWC 480 and V4046 Sgr). Across this sample, CS displays a range of radial distributions, from centrally peaked, to gaps and rings. We also present the first detection in PPDs of CS 6-5 (LkCa 15 and MWC 480), C S 6-5 (LkCa 15), and H CS , and (MWC 480) transitions. Using LTE models to constrain column densities and excitation temperatures, we find that either C and S are enhanced in CS, or CS is optically thick despite its relatively low brightness temperature. Additional lines and higher spatial resolution observations are needed to distinguish between these scenarios. Assuming CS is optically thin, CS column density model predictions reproduce the observations within a factor of a few for both MWC 480 and LkCa 15. However, the model underpredicts H CS by 1-2 orders of magnitude. Finally, comparing the H CS/CS ratio observed toward the MWC~480 disk and toward different ISM sources, we find the closest match with prestellar cores."

Recently, systematic discrepancies between NUV- and radio-derived CS abundances have been found to exceed a factor of 2 - 5, with NUV-derived abundances appearing enhanced for a wide array of comets. Interpretation of cometary CS emission in the ultraviolet has relied on a murky and ill-documented lineage of calculations whose accuracy can be difficult to assess. We report new fluorescence efficiencies of the CS radical, utilizing a rovibrational structure with vibrational states up to v = 8 and rotational states up to N = 100. The models utilize a new set of band transition rates derived from laboratory electron impact experiments. Benchmark comparisons to IUE observations of C/1979 Y1 (Bradfield) show favorable agreement with the fluorescence models. The present results affirm the accuracy of the historical record of CS abundances derived via ultraviolet CS emission in comets with IUE and HST, but do not explain the consistent enhancement of NUV-derived CS abundances relative to the radio measurements during the same apparitions. Alternative explanations of the factor of 2 - 5 discrepancy between NUV- and radio-derived CS abundances are discussed, as well as possible connections to sulfur reservoirs in protoplanetary disks. The model code and computed fluorescence efficiencies are made publicly available on the Zenodo service."

    "title": "Educating Educators to Integrate Inclusive Design Across a 4-Year CS Degree Program",
    "summary": "How can an entire CS faculty, who together have been teaching the ACM standard CS curricula, shift to teaching elements of inclusive design across a 4-year undergraduate CS program? And will they even want to try? To investigate these questions, we developed an educate-the-educators curriculum to support this shift. The overall goal of the educate-the-educators curriculum was to enable CS faculty to creatively engage with embedding inclusive design into their courses in \"minimally invasive\" ways. GenderMag, an inclusive design evaluation method, was selected for use. The curriculum targeted the following learning outcomes: to enable CS faculty: (1) to analyze the costs and benefits of integrating inclusive design into their own course(s); (2) to evaluate software using the GenderMag method, and recognize its use to identify meaningful issues in software; (3) to integrate inclusive design into existing course materials with provided resources and collaboration; and (4) to prepare to engage and guide students on learning GenderMag concepts. We conducted a field study over a spring/summer followed by end-of-fall interviews, during which we worked with 18 faculty members to integrate inclusive design into 13 courses. Ten of these faculty then taught 7 of these courses that were on the Fall 2021 schedule, across 16 sections. We present the new educate-the-educators curriculum and report on the faculty's experiences acting upon it over the three-month field study and subsequent interviews. Our results showed that, of the 18 faculty we worked with, 83% chose to modify their courses; by Fall 2021, faculty across all four years of a CS degree program had begun teaching inclusive design concepts. When we followed up with the 10 Fall 2021 faculty, 91% of their reported outcomes indicated that the incorporations of inclusive design concepts in their courses went as well as or better than expected."

    "summary": "The abundance and distribution of sulfur-bearing molecules in protoplanetary disks directly influences the composition and potential habitability of nascent planets in addition to providing powerful probes of the physical gas conditions in the disks themselves. Here, we present new and archival ALMA and SMA observations of CS and H CS, and their C S and H C S isotopologues, at high-angular resolution ( 0.\"2-0.\"4; 20-40 au) in the HD 163296 disk, which reveal a central cavity and multi-ringed emission structure. These observations comprise the most comprehensive, multi-line CS data in a planet-forming disk to date, spanning a wide range of excitation conditions from E =7.1 K to 129.3 K, and include new detections of C S, H CS, and H C S in this system. Using these data, we derive spatially-resolved rotational temperature and column density profiles for all species. We find a column density ratio N(H CS)/N(CS) 0.5, which is comparable to that of the similar MWC 480 disk and suggests that organic sulfur compounds may constitute a large fraction of the volatile sulfur reservoir in disks around Herbig stars generally. We derive S/ S ratios of 5 (CS/C S) and 2 (H CS/H C S) based on disk-averaged and spatially-resolved analyses. Both values are consistent across these two pairs of optically-thin molecules and are well-below the expected ISM ratio of 22, suggesting significant sulfur fractionation. We also constrain the CS emitting layer ( ) using the vertical separations of the disk surfaces in the channel maps and based on the known 2D gas structure of the HD 163296 disk combined with our excitation analysis."

Since data practice and internet consumption rates continue to upswing, cyber awareness has become progressively important. Furthermore, as businesses pace their digital transformation with mobile devices, cloud services, communal media, and Internet of Things services, cybersecurity has appeared as a critical issue in corporate risk management. This research focuses on the relations between cybersecurity awareness, cyber knowledge, computer ethics, cyber ethics, and cyber behavior, as well as protective tools, across university students in general. The findings express that while internet users are alert of cyber threats, they only take the most elementary and easy-to-implement precautions. Several knowledge and awareness have been proposed to knob the issue of cyber security. It also grants the principles of cybersecurity in terms of its structure, workforces, and evidence pertaining to the shield of personal information in the cyber world. The first step is for people to educate themselves about the negative aspects of the internet and to learn more about cyber threats so that they can notice when an attack is taking place. To validate the efficiency of the suggested analysis between CS and non-CS university students, case study along with several comparisons are provided."

    "summary": "We report on a chemical-abundance analysis of two very metal-poor horizontal-branch stars in the Milky Way halo: CS 22186-005 ([Fe/H]=-2.70) and CS 30344-033 ([Fe/H]=-2.90). The analysis is based on high-resolution spectra obtained at ESO, with the spectrographs HARPS at the 3.6 m telescope, and UVES at the VLT. We adopted one-dimensional, plane-parallel model atmospheres assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium. We derived elemental abundances for 13 elements for CS 22186-005 and 14 elements for CS 30344-033. This study is the first abundance analysis of CS 30344-033. CS 22186-005 has been analyzed previously, but we report here the first measurement of nickel (Ni; Z = 28) for this star, based on twenty-two NiI lines ([Ni/Fe]=-0.21 0.02); the measurement is significantly below the mean found for most metal-poor stars. Differences of up to 0.5 dex in [Ni/Fe] ratios were determined by different authors for the same type of stars in the literature, which means that it is not yet possible to conclude that there is a real intrinsic scatter in the [Ni/Fe] ratios. For the other elements for which we obtained estimates, the abundance patterns in these two stars match the Galactic trends defined by giant and turnoff stars well. This confirms the value of horizontal-branch stars as tracers of the chemical properties of stellar populations in the Galaxy. Our radial velocities measurements for CS 22186-005 differ from previously published measurements by more than the expected statistical errors. More measurements of the radial velocity of this star are encouraged to confirm or refute its radial velocity variability."

In this work, Cs diffusion through high energy grain boundaries (HEGBs) of cubic-SiC is studied using an ab-initio based kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model. The HEGB environment was modeled as an amorphous SiC (a-SiC), and Cs defect energies were calculated using density functional theory (DFT). From defect energies, it was suggested that the fastest diffusion mechanism as Cs interstitial in an amorphous SiC. The diffusion of Cs interstitial was simulated using a kMC, based on the site and transition state energies sampled from the DFT. The Cs HEGB diffusion exhibited an Arrhenius type diffusion in the range of 1200-1600°C. The comparison between HEGB results and the other studies suggests not only that the GB diffusion dominates the bulk diffusion, but also that the HEGB is one of the fastest grain boundary paths for the Cs diffusion. The diffusion coefficients in HEGB are clearly a few orders of magnitude lower than the reported diffusion coefficients from in- and out-of- pile samples, suggesting that other contributions are responsible, such as a radiation enhanced diffusion."

    "title": "An efficient deep convolutional laplacian pyramid architecture for CS reconstruction at low sampling ratios",
    "summary": "The compressed sensing (CS) has been successfully applied to image compression in the past few years as most image signals are sparse in a certain domain. Several CS reconstruction models have been proposed and obtained superior performance. However, these methods suffer from blocking artifacts or ringing effects at low sampling ratios in most cases. To address this problem, we propose a deep convolutional Laplacian Pyramid Compressed Sensing Network (LapCSNet) for CS, which consists of a sampling sub-network and a reconstruction sub-network. In the sampling sub-network, we utilize a convolutional layer to mimic the sampling operator. In contrast to the fixed sampling matrices used in traditional CS methods, the filters used in our convolutional layer are jointly optimized with the reconstruction sub-network. In the reconstruction sub-network, two branches are designed to reconstruct multi-scale residual images and muti-scale target images progressively using a Laplacian pyramid architecture. The proposed LapCSNet not only integrates multi-scale information to achieve better performance but also reduces computational cost dramatically. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of reconstructing more details and sharper edges against the state-of-the-arts methods."

However, the ground semantics of objects in the style transfer output is lost due to style spill-over on salient and background objects (content mismatch) or over-stylization. To solve this, we propose Semantic CLIPStyler (Sem-CS), that performs semantic style transfer. Sem-CS first segments the content image into salient and non-salient objects and then transfers artistic style based on a given style text description. The semantic style transfer is achieved using global foreground loss (for salient objects) and global background loss (for non-salient objects). Our empirical results, including DISTS, NIMA and user study scores, show that our proposed framework yields superior qualitative and quantitative performance.

    "title": "Matching Disparate Image Pairs Using Shape-Aware ConvNets",
    "summary": "An end-to-end trainable ConvNet architecture, that learns to harness the power of shape representation for matching disparate image pairs, is proposed. Disparate image pairs are deemed those that exhibit strong affine variations in scale, viewpoint and projection parameters accompanied by the presence of partial or complete occlusion of objects and extreme variations in ambient illumination. Under these challenging conditions, neither local nor global feature-based image matching methods, when used in isolation, have been observed to be effective. The proposed correspondence determination scheme for matching disparate images exploits high-level shape cues that are derived from low-level local feature descriptors, thus combining the best of both worlds. A graph-based representation for the disparate image pair is generated by constructing an affinity matrix that embeds the distances between feature points in two images, thus modeling the correspondence determination problem as one of graph matching. The eigenspectrum of the affinity matrix, i.e., the learned global shape representation, is then used to further regress the transformation or homography that defines the correspondence between the source image and target image. The proposed scheme is shown to yield state-of-the-art results for both, coarse-level shape matching as well as fine point-wise correspondence determination."

    "title": "Gas-phase Elemental abundances in Molecular cloudS (GEMS) III. Unlocking the CS chemistry: the CS+O reaction",
    "summary": "CS is among the most abundant gas-phase S-bearing molecules in cold dark molecular clouds. It is easily observable with several transitions in the millimeter wavelength range, and has been widely used as a tracer of the gas density in the interstellar medium in our Galaxy and external galaxies. Chemical models fail to account for the observed CS abundances when assuming the cosmic value for the elemental abundance of sulfur. The CS+O -> CO + S reaction has been proposed as a relevant CS destruction mechanism at low temperatures, and could explain the discrepancy between models and observations. Its reaction rate has been experimentally measured at temperatures of 150-400 K, but the extrapolation to lower temperatures is doubtful. Here we calculate the CS+O reaction rate at temperatures <150 K which are prevailing in the interstellar medium. We performed ab initio calculations to obtain the three lowest PES of the CS+O system. These PESs are used to study the reaction dynamics, using several methods to eventually calculate the CS+O thermal reaction rates. We compare the results of our theoretical calculations for 150-400 K with those obtained in the laboratory. Our detailed theoretical study on the CS+O reaction, which is in agreement with the experimental data obtained at 150-400 K, demonstrates the reliability of our approach. After a careful analysis at lower temperatures, we find that the rate constant at 10 K is negligible, which is consistent with the extrapolation of experimental data using the Arrhenius expression. We use the updated chemical network to model the sulfur chemistry in TMC1 based on molecular abundances determined from GEMS project observations. In our model, we take into account the expected decrease of the cosmic ray ionization rate along the cloud. The abundance of CS is still overestimated when assuming the cosmic value for the sulfur abundance."

    "title": "Deep Spectral Correspondence for Matching Disparate Image Pairs",
    "summary": "A novel, non-learning-based, saliency-aware, shape-cognizant correspondence determination technique is proposed for matching image pairs that are significantly disparate in nature. Images in the real world often exhibit high degrees of variation in scale, orientation, viewpoint, illumination and affine projection parameters, and are often accompanied by the presence of textureless regions and complete or partial occlusion of scene objects. The above conditions confound most correspondence determination techniques by rendering impractical the use of global contour-based descriptors or local pixel-level features for establishing correspondence. The proposed deep spectral correspondence (DSC) determination scheme harnesses the representational power of local feature descriptors to derive a complex high-level global shape representation for matching disparate images. The proposed scheme reasons about correspondence between disparate images using high-level global shape cues derived from low-level local feature descriptors. Consequently, the proposed scheme enjoys the best of both worlds, i.e., a high degree of invariance to affine parameters such as scale, orientation, viewpoint, illumination afforded by the global shape cues and robustness to occlusion provided by the low-level feature descriptors. While the shape-based component within the proposed scheme infers what to look for, an additional saliency-based component dictates where to look at thereby tackling the noisy correspondences arising from the presence of textureless regions and complex backgrounds. In the proposed scheme, a joint image graph is constructed using distances computed between interest points in the appearance (i.e., image) space. Eigenspectral decomposition of the joint image graph allows for reasoning about shape similarity to be performed jointly, in the appearance space and eigenspace."

To take these information optimizations into consideration, in this paper, we propose a Context-Space Progressive Collaborative Network (CS-PCN) for image denoising. CS-PCN is a multi-stage hierarchical architecture composed of a context mining siamese sub-network (CM2S) and a space synthesis sub-network (3S). CM2S aims at extracting rich multi-scale contextual information by sequentially connecting multi-layer feature processors (MLFP) for semantic information pre-processing, attention encoder-decoders (AED) for multi-scale information, and multi-conv attention controllers (MCAC) for supervised feature fusion. 3S parallels MLFP and a single-scale cascading block to learn image details, which not only maintains the contextual information but also emphasizes the complementary spatial ones. Experimental results show that CS-PCN achieves significant performance improvement in synthetic and real-world noise removal."

Specifically, we excite vertical center of mass oscillations of the Cs condensate, and observe significant damping for the Cs dipole mode, due to the rapid transfer of energy to the larger Yb component, and the ensuing acoustic dissipation. Numerical simulations based on coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations provide excellent agreement, and additionally reveal the possibility of late-time revivals (beating) which are found to be highly sensitive to the Cs and Yb atom number combinations. By further tuning the interaction strength of Cs using a broad Feshbach resonance, we explore the stability of the degenerate mixture, and observe collapse of the Cs condensate mediated by the attractive Cs-Yb interaction when , well above the single-species collapse threshold, in good agreement with simulations."

The essence of our results is that the CS( ) masers are collisionally pumped and that, depending on the spectral energy distribution, dust emission can suppress the masers. Apart from the J=1-0 and J=2-1 masers the calculations also show that the J=3-2 transition can be inverted to produce maser emission. It is found that beaming is necessary to explain the observed brightness temperatures of the recently discovered CS masers in W51 e2e. The model calculations suggest that a CS abundance of a few times and CS( ) column densities of the order are required for these masers. The rarity of the CS masers in high mass star forming regions might be the result of a required high CS abundance as well as due to attenuation of the maser emission inside as well as outside of the hot core."

    "summary": "Searching for local communities is an important research challenge that allows for personalized community discovery and supports advanced data analysis in various complex networks, such as the World Wide Web, social networks, and brain networks. The evolution of these networks over time has motivated several recent studies to identify local communities in temporal networks. Given any query nodes, Community Search aims to find a densely connected subgraph containing query nodes. However, existing community search approaches in temporal networks have two main limitations: (1) they adopt pre-defined subgraph patterns to model communities, which cannot find communities that do not conform to these patterns in real-world networks, and (2) they only use the aggregation of disjoint structural information to measure quality, missing the dynamic of connections and temporal properties. In this paper, we propose a query-driven Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (CS-TGN) that can capture flexible community structures by learning from the ground-truth communities in a data-driven manner. CS-TGN first combines the local query-dependent structure and the global graph embedding in each snapshot of the network and then uses a GRU cell with contextual attention to learn the dynamics of interactions and update node embeddings over time. We demonstrate how this model can be used for interactive community search in an online setting, allowing users to evaluate the found communities and provide feedback. Experiments on real-world temporal graphs with ground-truth communities validate the superior quality of the solutions obtained and the efficiency of our model in both temporal and interactive static settings."

Community search, a fundamental task in graph analysis, aims to identify groups of nodes with dense interconnections, which is crucial for understanding the macroscopic structure of graphs. In this paper, we propose GraphCS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs in community search tasks. Our experiments reveal that while LLMs exhibit preliminary potential, they frequently fail to return meaningful results and suffer from output bias. To address these limitations, we introduce CS-Agent, a dual-agent collaborative framework to enhance LLM-based community search. CS-Agent leverages the complementary strengths of two LLMs acting as Solver and Validator. Through iterative feedback and refinement, CS-Agent dynamically refines initial results without fine-tuning or additional training. After the multi-round dialogue, Decider module selects the optimal community. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-Agent significantly improves the quality and stability of identified communities compared to baseline methods. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply LLMs to community search, bridging the gap between LLMs and graph analysis while providing a robust and adaptive solution for real-world applications."

We aim at determining the physical parameters of the cores, i.e., temperature, volume density, column density and (radial) velocity fields, and the status of star formation, i.e., whether embedded objects are present within the cores. Surveying small dark clouds in both celestial hemispheres we study the physical conditions of low-mass star formation for detectable core masses M>0.01Msun. The target list is drawn from catalogues of optically selected dark cloud cores, where the visual extinction exceeds 5 magnitudes. The selected probe is the CS molecule that needs high densities for excitation of its rotational levels. To gauge the state of excitation, the cores were observed in two transitions. In a limited number of cases, optical depths were derived from complementing lines of the rarer isotopologue C34S for the (2-1) and (3-2) transitions. Making small (3arcmin by 3arcmin) maps, the 471 optically selected cores were searched for CS(2-1) and 315 (67%) were detected (T_A*>3sigma). In general, the position of peak CS emission does not coincide with the optically determined centre of the cores. The cores appear cold (T<10K) and, in the majority of cases, the CS emission is optically thin (tau<1). On the arcminute scales of the observations, the median column density of carbon monosulfide is N(CS)=7.E12/cm2. For an average abundance of N(CS)/N(H2)=1.E-8, the median mass of the detected cores is 1.0Msun.

    "title": "Abnormal behavior of Cs polyoxides under high pressure",
    "summary": "High-pressure can transform the structures and compositions of materials either by changing the relative strengths of bonds or by altering the oxidation states of atoms. Both effects cause unconventional compositions in novel compounds that have been synthesized or predicted in large numbers in the past decade. What naturally follows is a question: what if pressure imposes strong effects on both chemical bonds and atomic orbitals in the same material. A systematic DFT and crystal structure search study of Cs polyoxides under high pressure shows a striking transition of chemistry due to the activation of the Cs 5p core electrons. Opposing to the general trend of polyoxides, the O-O bonds disappear in Cs polyoxides and Cs and O atoms form molecules and monolayers with strong Cs-O covalent bonds. Especially, the abnormal transition of structure and chemical bonds happens to CsO, a solid peroxide that is stable under ambient pressure, at 221 GPa, which can be accessed by current high-pressure experiments."

Cs is shown to be much more stable at the Sigma3 grain boundary than in bulk of SiC with a significant decrease (7-17eV) in the formation energies at the grain boundaries than in bulk. It is found to have even lower formation energies than those of Ag at the Sigma3 grain boundaries, while this trend was opposite in the bulk SiC as demonstrate previously from similar density functional theory calculations. Based on these results, a possible route to control Cs release from SiC layer via grain-boundary-engineering is suggested."

    "summary": "In most galaxies like the Milky Way, stars form in clouds of molecular gas. Unlike the CO emission that traces the bulk of molecular gas, the rotational transitions of HCN and CS molecules mainly probe the dense phase of molecular gas, which has a tight and almost linear relation with the far-infrared luminosity and star formation rate. However, it is unclear if dense molecular gas exists at very low metallicity, and if exists, how it is related to star formation. In this work, we report ALMA observations of the CS =5 4 emission line of DDO~70, a nearby gas-rich dwarf galaxy with solar metallicity. We did not detect CS emission from all regions with strong CO emission. After stacking all CS spectra from CO-bright clumps, we find no more than a marginal detection of CS =5 4 transition, at a signal-to-noise ratio of . This 3- upper limit deviates from the - and -SFR relationships found in local star forming galaxies and dense clumps in the Milky Way, implying weaker CS emission at given IR luminosity and SFR. We discuss the possible mechanisms that suppress CS emission at low metallicity."

    "summary": "Deep Learning (DL) based Compressed Sensing (CS) has been applied for better performance of image reconstruction than traditional CS methods. However, most existing DL methods utilize the block-by-block measurement and each measurement block is restored separately, which introduces harmful blocking effects for reconstruction. Furthermore, the neuronal receptive fields of those methods are designed to be the same size in each layer, which can only collect single-scale spatial information and has a negative impact on the reconstruction process. This paper proposes a novel framework named Multi-scale Dilated Convolution Neural Network (MsDCNN) for CS measurement and reconstruction. During the measurement period, we directly obtain all measurements from a trained measurement network, which employs fully convolutional structures and is jointly trained with the reconstruction network from the input image. It needn't be cut into blocks, which effectively avoids the block effect. During the reconstruction period, we propose the Multi-scale Feature Extraction (MFE) architecture to imitate the human visual system to capture multi-scale features from the same feature map, which enhances the image feature extraction ability of the framework and improves the performance of image reconstruction. In the MFE, there are multiple parallel convolution channels to obtain multi-scale feature information. Then the multi-scale features information is fused and the original image is reconstructed with high quality. Our experimental results show that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM."

While the 0.5 ML covered surface is of metallic nature, we found that 1 ML of Cs adsorption corresponds to saturation coverage and leads to a semiconducting surface. The results for the electronic behavior and surface work function suggest that adsorption of Cs takes place via polarized covalent bonding."

While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers new computational capabilities, its black-box nature poses challenges for adoption in domains that demand transparency and trust. In this work, we present IQNN-CS, an interpretable quantum neural network framework designed for multiclass credit risk classification. The architecture combines a variational QNN with a suite of post-hoc explanation techniques tailored for structured data. To address the lack of structured interpretability in QML, we introduce Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA), a novel metric that quantifies attribution divergence across predicted classes, revealing how the model distinguishes between credit risk categories. Evaluated on two real-world credit datasets, IQNN-CS demonstrates stable training dynamics, competitive predictive performance, and enhanced interpretability. Our results highlight a practical path toward transparent and accountable QML models for financial decision-making."

We find that the new LUNA measures have much reduced the nuclear uncertainties of the Ne and Na AGB ejecta, which drop from factors of to only a factor of few for the lowest metallicity models. Relying on the most recent estimations for the destruction rate of Na, the uncertainties that still affect the Ne and Na AGB ejecta are mainly dominated by evolutionary aspects (efficiency of mass-loss, third dredge-up, convection). Finally, we discuss how the LUNA results impact on the hypothesis that invokes massive AGB stars as the main agents of the observed O-Na anti-correlation in Galactic globular clusters. We derive quantitative indications on the efficiencies of key physical processes (mass loss, third dredge-up, sodium destruction) in order to simultaneously reproduce both the Na-rich, O-poor extreme of the anti-correlation, and the observational constraints on the CNO abundance.

As a result, high-resolution imaging in those spectrum remains beyond the reach of most consumers. Over the last decade, compressive sensing (CS) has emerged as a potential means to realize inexpensive short-wave infrared cameras. One approach for doing this is the single-pixel camera (SPC) where a single detector acquires coded measurements of a high-resolution image. A computational reconstruction algorithm is then used to recover the image from these coded measurements. Unfortunately, the measurement rate of a SPC is insufficient to enable imaging at high spatial and temporal resolutions. We present a focal plane array-based compressive sensing (FPA-CS) architecture that achieves high spatial and temporal resolutions. The idea is to use an array of SPCs that sense in parallel to increase the measurement rate, and consequently, the achievable spatio-temporal resolution of the camera. We develop a proof-of-concept prototype in the short-wave infrared using a sensor with 64 64 pixels; the prototype provides a 4096 increase in the measurement rate compared to the SPC and achieves a megapixel resolution at video rate using CS techniques."

To solve this, we propose Semantic CLIPStyler (Sem-CS) that performs semantic style transfer. Sem-CS first segments the content image into salient and non-salient objects and then transfers artistic style based on a given style text description. The semantic style transfer is achieved using global foreground loss (for salient objects) and global background loss (for non-salient objects). Our empirical results, including DISTS, NIMA and user study scores, show that our proposed framework yields superior qualitative and quantitative performance."

Given a text query, RGS determines a stable grasp pose to manipulate the referred object in the robot's workspace. RGS comprises two steps: visual grounding and grasp pose estimation. Recent studies leverage powerful Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for visually grounding free-flowing natural language in real-world robotic execution. However, comparisons in complex, cluttered environments with multiple instances of the same object are lacking. This paper introduces HiFi-CS, featuring hierarchical application of Featurewise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to fuse image and text embeddings, enhancing visual grounding for complex attribute rich text queries encountered in robotic grasping. Visual grounding associates an object in 2D/3D space with natural language input and is studied in two scenarios: Closed and Open Vocabulary. HiFi-CS features a lightweight decoder combined with a frozen VLM and outperforms competitive baselines in closed vocabulary settings while being 100x smaller in size. Our model can effectively guide open-set object detectors like GroundedSAM to enhance open-vocabulary performance. We validate our approach through real-world RGS experiments using a 7-DOF robotic arm, achieving 90.33\\% visual grounding accuracy in 15 tabletop scenes.

(1996; 1998). We detected emission in the CS (2-1), N2H+ (1-0), and HCO+ (1-0) lines. Several clumps of size ~0.08 pc were found for each line distributed all over the region where previous single-dish emission was found (Morata et al. 1997). Each molecular transition traces differently the clump distribution, although in some cases the detected clumps are coincident. The distribution of the N2H+ emission and the single-dish NH3 emission are coincident and compatible with an origin in the same gas. The large fraction of missing flux measured for the CS (2-1) transition can be explained if the cloud is formed by a clumpy and heterogeneous medium. Four positions were selected to derive the abundance ratios [N2H+/CS] and [HCO+/CS] from the molecular column density determinations, and to compare them with the values predicted by the chemical model. The model was able to explain the interferometric observations, and, in particular, the chemical differentiation of the detected clumps and the coincidence of the NH3 and N2H+ emissions. The lack of HCO+ towards the two selected positions that trace the more evolved clumps cannot be accounted for by the model, but it is possibly due to strong self-absorption. We propose a classification of the studied clumps according to the stage of chemical evolution indicated by the molecular abundances."

Using the IRAM-30m telescope, we mapped the distribution of the CS(2-1) and CS(3-2) lines in the circumnuclear regions of the nearby starburst galaxies NGC 3079 and NGC 6946. We also detected the formaldehyde (H2CO) and methanol (CH3OH) in both galaxies. We marginally detect the isotopologue C34S. Results. We calculate column densities under LTE conditions for CS and CH3OH. Using the detections accumulated here to guide our inputs, we link a time and depth dependent chemical model with a molecular line radiative transfer model; we reproduce the observations, showing how conditions where CS is present are likely to vary away from the galactic centres. Conclusions. Using the rotational diagram method for CH3OH, we obtain a lower limit temperature of 14 K. In addition to this, by comparing the chemical and radiative transfer models to observations, we determine the properties of the dense gas as traced by CS (and CH3OH). We also estimate the quantity of the dense gas. We find that, provided that there are a between 10^5 and 10^6 dense cores in our beam, for both target galaxies, emission of CS from warm (T = 100 - 400 K), dense (n(H2) = 10^5-6 cm-3) cores, possibly with a high cosmic ray ionisation rate (zeta = 100 zeta0) best describes conditions for our central pointing. In NGC 6946, conditions are generally cooler and/or less dense further from the centre, whereas in NGC 3079, conditions are more uniform. The inclusion of shocks allows for more efficient CS formation, leading to an order of magnitude less dense gas being required to replicate observations in some cases."

From the unsupervised disentanglement perspective, we rethink content and style and propose a formulation for unsupervised C-S disentanglement based on our assumption that different factors are of different importance and popularity for image reconstruction, which serves as a data bias. The corresponding model inductive bias is introduced by our proposed C-S disentanglement Module (C-S DisMo), which assigns different and independent roles to content and style when approximating the real data distributions. Specifically, each content embedding from the dataset, which encodes the most dominant factors for image reconstruction, is assumed to be sampled from a shared distribution across the dataset. The style embedding for a particular image, encoding the remaining factors, is used to customize the shared distribution through an affine transformation. The experiments on several popular datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art unsupervised C-S disentanglement, which is comparable or even better than supervised methods. We verify the effectiveness of our method by downstream tasks: domain translation and single-view 3D reconstruction. Project page at https://github.com/xrenaa/CS-DisMo."

The adsorption of Cs onto a Bi Se surface is investigated by low energy ion scattering and work function measurements. Much of the deposited Cs quickly diffuses to the step edges forming one-dimensional chains of positively charged adatoms, along with some deposition on the terraces. The work function decreases until a coverage of 0.1 ML is reached, beyond which it increases slightly. The minimum in the work function is due to depolarization of the dipoles induced when the concentration of adatoms in the chains reaches a critical value. A slow diffusion of adsorbed Cs from the terraces to the step edges is also marked by changes in the neutralization of scattered Na and work function over time. The spatial distribution of the conductive charges in the TSS, which are primarily positioned between the first and second atomic layers, is confirmed by comparison of the neutralization of Na scattered from Bi and Se."

    "title": "Converged Deep Framework Assembling Principled Modules for CS-MRI",
    "summary": "Compressed Sensing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CS-MRI) significantly accelerates MR data acquisition at a sampling rate much lower than the Nyquist criterion. A major challenge for CS-MRI lies in solving the severely ill-posed inverse problem to reconstruct aliasing-free MR images from the sparse k-space data. Conventional methods typically optimize an energy function, producing reconstruction of high quality, but their iterative numerical solvers unavoidably bring extremely slow processing. Recent data-driven techniques are able to provide fast restoration by either learning direct prediction to final reconstruction or plugging learned modules into the energy optimizer. Nevertheless, these data-driven predictors cannot guarantee the reconstruction following constraints underlying the regularizers of conventional methods so that the reliability of their reconstruction results are questionable. In this paper, we propose a converged deep framework assembling principled modules for CS-MRI that fuses learning strategy with the iterative solver of a conventional reconstruction energy. This framework embeds an optimal condition checking mechanism, fostering efficient and reliable reconstruction. We also apply the framework to two practical tasks, i.e. , parallel imaging and reconstruction with Rician noise. Extensive experiments on both benchmark and manufacturer-testing images demonstrate that the proposed method reliably converges to the optimal solution more efficiently and accurately than the state-of-the-art in various scenarios."

Our goals are to compare the CS, N2H+ and dust distributions in a representative sample of high-mass star forming dense cores and to determine the physical and chemical properties of these cores. Methods. We compare the results of CS(5-4) and 1.2 mm continuum mapping of twelve dense cores from the southern hemisphere presented in this work, in combination with our previous N2H+(1-0) and CS(2-1) data. We use numerical modeling of molecular excitation to estimate physical parameters of the cores. Results. Most of the maps have several emission peaks (clumps). We derive basic physical parameters of the clumps and estimate CS and N2H+ abundances. Masses calculated from LVG densities are higher than CS virial masses and masses derived from continuum data, implying small-scale clumpiness of the cores. For most of the objects, the CS and continuum peaks are close to the IRAS point source positions. The CS(5-4) intensities correlate with continuum fluxes per beam in all cases, but only in five cases with the N2H+(1-0) intensities. The study of spatial variations of molecular integrated intensity ratios to continuum fluxes reveals that I(N2H+)/F 1.2 ratios drop towards the CS peaks for most of the sources, which can be due to a N2H+ abundance decrease. For CS(5-4), the I(CS)/F 1.2 ratios show no clear trends with distance from the CS peaks, while for CS(2-1) such ratios drop towards these peaks. Possible explanations of these results are considered. The analysis of normalized velocity differences between CS and N2H+ lines has not revealed indications of systematic motions towards CS peaks."

We construct the effective potentials of the and states by analogy with the effective potentials of the leading order (LO) and next-to-leading-order (NLO) interactions. Then we introduce an SU(3) breaking factor to identify the differences between the effective potentials in the and states. We perform two calculations to discuss the differences and similarities of the and states. In the first calculation, we adopt the LECs extracted from the experimental states to calculate the states, and show that if the is the SU(3) partner of the , then our framework can reproduce the large width difference between the and by adjusting the SU(3) breaking factor in a reasonable region. Besides, this SU(3) breaking effect also accounts for the absence of a state with , which should be the SU(3) partner of the . In the second calculation, we separately fit the LECs from the experimental and states. We show that these two sets of LECs are very similar to each other, indicating a unified set of LECs that could describe the effective potentials of the and states simultaneously. Then we proceed to systematically predict the other possible and states that are close to the and systems, respectively. Further explorations on the states would be crucial to test our theory."

Several broad s-wave resonances provide prospects to create fermionic LiCs molecules with a large dipole moment via Feshbach association followed by stimulated Raman passage. Two of the s-wave resonances overlap with a zero crossing of the Cs scattering length which offers prospects for the investigation of polarons in an ultracold Li-Cs mixture."

In doing so we obtain CS-TSSOS -- a two-level hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations with (i), the crucial property to involve blocks of SDP matrices and (ii), the guarantee of convergence to the global optimum under certain conditions. We demonstrate its efficiency and scalability on several large-scale instances of the celebrated Max-Cut problem and the important industrial optimal power flow problem, involving up to six thousand variables and tens of thousands of constraints."

    "title": "M$^3$CS: Multi-Target Masked Point Modeling with Learnable Codebook and Siamese Decoders",
    "summary": "Masked point modeling has become a promising scheme of self-supervised pre-training for point clouds. Existing methods reconstruct either the original points or related features as the objective of pre-training. However, considering the diversity of downstream tasks, it is necessary for the model to have both low- and high-level representation modeling capabilities to capture geometric details and semantic contexts during pre-training. To this end, M CS is proposed to enable the model with the above abilities. Specifically, with masked point cloud as input, M CS introduces two decoders to predict masked representations and the original points simultaneously. While an extra decoder doubles parameters for the decoding process and may lead to overfitting, we propose siamese decoders to keep the amount of learnable parameters unchanged. Further, we propose an online codebook projecting continuous tokens into discrete ones before reconstructing masked points. In such way, we can enforce the decoder to take effect through the combinations of tokens rather than remembering each token. Comprehensive experiments show that M CS achieves superior performance at both classification and segmentation tasks, outperforming existing methods."

    "summary": "The sulfur chemistry in protoplanetary disks influences the properties of nascent planets, including potential habitability. Although the inventory of sulfur molecules in disks has gradually increased over the last decade, CS is still the most commonly-observed sulfur-bearing species and it is expected to be the dominant gas-phase sulfur carrier beyond the water snowline. Despite this, few dedicated multi-line observations exist, and thus the typical disk CS chemistry is not well constrained. Moreover, it is unclear how that chemistry - and in turn, the bulk volatile sulfur reservoir - varies with stellar and disk properties. Here, we present the largest survey of CS to date, combining both new and archival observations from ALMA, SMA, and NOEMA of 12 planet-forming disks, covering a range of stellar spectral types and dust morphologies. Using these data, we derived disk-integrated CS gas excitation conditions in each source. Overall, CS chemistry appears similar across our sample with rotational temperatures of 10-40 K and column densities between 10 -10 cm . CS column densities do not show strong trends with most source properties, which broadly suggests that CS chemistry is not highly sensitive to disk structure or stellar characteristics. We do, however, identify a positive correlation between stellar X-ray luminosity and CS column density, which indicates that the dominant CS formation pathway is likely via ion-neutral reactions in the upper disk layers, where X-ray-enhanced S and C drive abundant CS production. Thus, using CS as a tracer of gas-phase sulfur abundance requires a nuanced approach that accounts for its emitting region and dependence on X-ray luminosity."

One source is the high-frequency H events responsible for heavy r-nuclei (A>135) but not Fe. The H-yields calculated from data on other ultra-metal-poor stars and the sun provide a template for quantitatively predicting the abundances of all other r-elements. In CS 31082-001 these should show a significant deficiency at A<135 relative to the solar r-pattern. It is proposed that CS 31082-001 should have had a companion that exploded as an SNII H event. If the binary survived the explosion, this star should now have a compact companion, most likely a stellar-mass black hole. Comparison of abundance data with predicted values and a search for a compact companion should provide a stringent test of the proposed r-process model. The U-Th age determined by Cayrel et al. for CS 31082-001 is, to within substantial uncertainties, in accord with the r-process age determined from solar system data. The time gap between Big Bang and onset of normal star formation only allows r-process chronometers to provide a lower limit on the age of the universe."

We intend to determine the magnitude of the turbulent motions in the outer parts (> 100 AU) of the disk surrounding DM Tau. Turbulent motions can be constrained by measuring the nonthermal broadening of line emission from heavy molecules. We used the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer to study emission from the CS molecule in the disk of DM Tau. High spatial (1.4 x 1 \") and spectral resolution (0.126 km/s) CS J=3-2 images provide constraints on the molecule distribution and velocity structure of the disk. A low sensitivity CS J=5-4 image was used in conjunction to evaluate the excitation conditions. We analyzed the data in terms of two parametric disk models, and compared the results with detailed time-dependent chemical simulations. The CS data confirm the relatively low temperature suggested by observations of other simple molecules. The intrinsic linewidth derived from the CS J=3-2 data is much larger than expected from pure thermal broadening. The magnitude of the derived nonthermal component depends only weakly on assumptions about the location of the CS molecules with respect to the disk plane. Our results indicate turbulence with a Mach number around 0.4 - 0.5 in the molecular layer. Geometrical constraints suggest that this layer is located near one scale height, in reasonable agreement with chemical model predictions."

The dynamics of excited-Cs-atom desorption and re-adsorption as well as CsHe exciplex formation are measured using femtosecond pump-probe velocity-map-imaging spectroscopy and ion-time-of-flight spectrometry. The timescales for the desorption of excited Cs atoms off helium nanodroplets as well as the timescales for CsHe exciplex formation are experimentally determined for the 6p states of Cs. For the 6p state, our results confirm that the excited Cs atoms only desorb from the nanodroplet when the excitation wavenumber is blue-shifted from the resonance. Our results suggest that the dynamics following excitation to the 6p state can be described by an evaporation-like desorption mechanism, whereas the dynamics arising from excitation to the 6p state is indicative for a more impulsive desorption process. Furthermore, our results suggest a helium-induced spin-orbit relaxation from the the 6p state to the 6p state.

    "summary": "Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of effectively finding efficient collision-free paths for a group of agents in a shared workspace. The MAPF community has largely focused on developing high-performance heuristic search methods. Recently, several works have applied various machine learning (ML) techniques to solve MAPF, usually involving sophisticated architectures, reinforcement learning techniques, and set-ups, but none using large amounts of high-quality supervised data. Our initial objective in this work was to show how simple large scale imitation learning of high-quality heuristic search methods can lead to state-of-the-art ML MAPF performance. However, we find that, at least with our model architecture, simple large scale (700k examples with hundreds of agents per example) imitation learning does not produce impressive results. Instead, we find that by using prior work that post-processes MAPF model predictions to resolve 1-step collisions (CS-PIBT), we can train a simple ML MAPF model in minutes that dramatically outperforms existing ML MAPF policies. This has serious implications for all future ML MAPF policies (with local communication) which currently struggle to scale. In particular, this finding implies that future learnt policies should (1) always use smart 1-step collision shields (e.g. CS-PIBT), (2) always include the collision shield with greedy actions as a baseline (e.g. PIBT) and (3) motivates future models to focus on longer horizon / more complex planning as 1-step collisions can be efficiently resolved."

However, existing works such as CycleMLP and Vision Permutator typically model spatial information in equal-size spatial regions and do not consider cross-scale spatial interactions. Further, their token mixers only model 1- or 2-axis correlations, avoiding 3-axis spatial-channel mixing due to its computational demands. We therefore propose CS-Mixer, a hierarchical Vision MLP that learns dynamic low-rank transformations for spatial-channel mixing through cross-scale local and global aggregation. The proposed methodology achieves competitive results on popular image recognition benchmarks without incurring substantially more compute.

The Spitzer IRS spectrum also shows [Ne II] 12.81 micron fine-structure emission with a luminosity of 1.3x10^29 ergs s^-1, indicating that optically thin gas is present in this ~43 AU hole, in agreement with H_alpha measurements and a UV excess which indicate that CS Cha is still accreting 1.2x10^-8 M_sun yr^-1. We do not find a correlation of the [Ne II] flux with L_X, however, there is a possible correlation with mass accretion rate, which if confirmed would suggest that EUV fluxes due to accretion are the main agent for formation of the [Ne II] line."

    "title": "\"Give me the code\" -- Log Analysis of First-Year CS Students' Interactions With GPT",
    "summary": "The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3, GPT-4, and Bard in computer science (CS) education is expected to be profound. Students now have the power to generate code solutions for a wide array of programming assignments. For first-year students, this may be particularly problematic since the foundational skills are still in development and an over-reliance on generative AI tools can hinder their ability to grasp essential programming concepts. This paper analyzes the prompts used by 69 freshmen undergraduate students to solve a certain programming problem within a project assignment, without giving them prior prompt training. We also present the rules of the exercise that motivated the prompts, designed to foster critical thinking skills during the interaction. Despite using unsophisticated prompting techniques, our findings suggest that the majority of students successfully leveraged GPT, incorporating the suggested solutions into their projects. Additionally, half of the students demonstrated the ability to exercise judgment in selecting from multiple GPT-generated solutions, showcasing the development of their critical thinking skills in evaluating AI-generated code."

    "summary": "Over the past few years, there has been remarkable progress in research on 3D point clouds and their use in autonomous driving scenarios has become widespread. However, deep learning methods heavily rely on annotated data and often face domain generalization issues. Unlike 2D images whose domains usually pertain to the texture information present in them, the features derived from a 3D point cloud are affected by the distribution of the points. The lack of a 3D domain adaptation benchmark leads to the common practice of training a model on one benchmark (e.g. Waymo) and then assessing it on another dataset (e.g. KITTI). This setting results in two distinct domain gaps: scenarios and sensors, making it difficult to analyze and evaluate the method accurately. To tackle this problem, this paper presents LiDAR Dataset with Cross Sensors (LiDAR-CS Dataset), which contains large-scale annotated LiDAR point cloud under six groups of different sensors but with the same corresponding scenarios, captured from hybrid realistic LiDAR simulator. To our knowledge, LiDAR-CS Dataset is the first dataset that addresses the sensor-related gaps in the domain of 3D object detection in real traffic. Furthermore, we evaluate and analyze the performance using various baseline detectors and demonstrated its potential applications. Project page: https://opendriving.github.io/lidar-cs."

    "title": "Deformation corrected compressed sensing (DC-CS): a novel framework for accelerated dynamic MRI",
    "summary": "We propose a novel deformation corrected compressed sensing (DC-CS) framework to recover dynamic magnetic resonance images from undersampled measurements. We introduce a generalized formulation that is capable of handling a wide class of sparsity/compactness priors on the deformation corrected dynamic signal. In this work, we consider example compactness priors such as sparsity in temporal Fourier domain, sparsity in temporal finite difference domain, and nuclear norm penalty to exploit low rank structure. Using variable splitting, we decouple the complex optimization problem to simpler and well understood sub problems; the resulting algorithm alternates between simple steps of shrinkage based denoising, deformable registration, and a quadratic optimization step. Additionally, we employ efficient continuation strategies to minimize the risk of convergence to local minima. The proposed formulation contrasts with existing DC-CS schemes that are customized for free breathing cardiac cine applications, and other schemes that rely on fully sampled reference frames or navigator signals to estimate the deformation parameters. The efficient decoupling enabled by the proposed scheme allows its application to a wide range of applications including contrast enhanced dynamic MRI. Through experiments on numerical phantom and in vivo myocardial perfusion MRI datasets, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed DC-CS scheme in providing robust reconstructions with reduced motion artifacts over classical compressed sensing schemes that utilize the compact priors on the original deformation un-corrected signal."

    "summary": "We evaluate the rate of the absorption of an optical nanofiber mode by a Cs atom in an electric quadrupole transition. With the Cs atom localized near the outer surface of the optical nano-fiber, an interaction occurs between the atomic quadrupole tensor components and the gradients of the vector components of the electric field of a hybrid fiber mode. The absorption rate is evaluated as a function of the radial position of the atom from the fiber axis, assuming a specific value of the laser power and we use experimentally accessible parameters. We find that the absorption of the hybrid modes by the Cs atom decreases as the atom recedes away from the fiber axis and formally vanishes at sufficiently large radial distances. Close to the fiber, however, the absorption rate for the input power chosen can be two orders of magnitude larger than the quadrupole de-excitation rate despite the moderate power used."

    "title": "CS-Shapley: Class-wise Shapley Values for Data Valuation in Classification",
    "summary": "Data valuation, or the valuation of individual datum contributions, has seen growing interest in machine learning due to its demonstrable efficacy for tasks such as noisy label detection. In particular, due to the desirable axiomatic properties, several Shapley value approximation methods have been proposed. In these methods, the value function is typically defined as the predictive accuracy over the entire development set. However, this limits the ability to differentiate between training instances that are helpful or harmful to their own classes. Intuitively, instances that harm their own classes may be noisy or mislabeled and should receive a lower valuation than helpful instances. In this work, we propose CS-Shapley, a Shapley value with a new value function that discriminates between training instances' in-class and out-of-class contributions. Our theoretical analysis shows the proposed value function is (essentially) the unique function that satisfies two desirable properties for evaluating data values in classification. Further, our experiments on two benchmark evaluation tasks (data removal and noisy label detection) and four classifiers demonstrate the effectiveness of CS-Shapley over existing methods. Lastly, we evaluate the \"transferability\" of data values estimated from one classifier to others, and our results suggest Shapley-based data valuation is transferable for application across different models."

    "summary": "The circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars harbour a rich variety of molecules and are sites of complex chemistry. Our current understanding of the circumstellar chemical processes of carbon-rich AGB stars is predominantly based on observations of a single star, IRC+10216, often regarded as an archetypical carbon star. We aim to estimate stellar and circumstellar properties for five carbon stars, and constrain their circumstellar CS abundances. This study compares the CS abundances among the sources, informs circumstellar chemical models, and helps to assess if IRC+10216 is a good representative of the physics and chemistry of carbon star CSEs. We modelled the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and CO line emission to derive the stellar and outflow properties. Using these, we then retrieved CS abundance profiles with detailed radiative transfer modelling, imposing spatial and excitation constraints from ALMA and single-dish observations. We obtain good fits to the SEDs and CO lines for all sources and reproduce the CS line emission across various transitions and apertures, yielding robust estimates of the CS abundance profiles. Peak CS fractional abundances range from 1 10 - 4 10 , with e-folding radii of 1.8 10 - 6.8 10 cm. We also derive reliable C/ C and S/ S ratios from CS isotopologue modelling. Our results refine previous single-dish CS abundance estimates and improve the relative uncertainty on the CS e-folding radius for IRAS 07454 7112 by a factor of 2.5. Chemical models reproduce our estimates of the CS radial extent, corroborating the CS photodissociation framework used therein. We find no significant differences between the derived CS abundance profiles for IRC+10216 and the rest of the sample, apart from the expected density-driven variations."

As a result, there is a growing awareness of the need to develop professionals who will harness these technologies in fair and inclusive ways and use them to address global issues like health, water management, poverty, and human rights. In this regard, many academic researchers have expressed the need to complement traditional teaching of CS technical skills with computer and information ethics (computing for social good), as well as communication and leadership skills. In this paper, we describe our goals and some possible class activities we have developed and refined over the past few years with encouraging results, to help CS students understand the potential uses of computing for social good. In these carefully planned project assignments, we seamlessly integrate traditional approaches to develop technical skills with broader professional responsibility and soft skills.

    "summary": "The spatial distribution of molecules in AGB circumstellar envelopes is regulated by different processes. In the outer layers all molecules are destroyed due to the interaction with interstellar ultraviolet photons. Here we aim to characterize in a coherent and uniform way the radial extent of three molecules (SiO, CS, and SiS) in envelopes around AGB stars of O- and C-rich character, and to study their dependence with mass loss rate. To that purpose, we used the Yebes 40m and IRAM 30m telescopes to observe 7 M-type and 7 C-type AGB envelopes covering a wide range of mass loss rates (1e-7 - 1e-5 Msun/yr) in lines of SiO, CS, and SiS spanning a range of upper level energies of 2-130 K. We carried out excitation and radiative transfer calculations over a wide parameter space to characterize the molecular abundance and radial extent. A chi2 analysis indicates that the abundance is well constrained while the radial extent is more difficult to constrain. The radial extent increases with increasing envelope density, in agreement with previous observational findings. At high envelope densities, Mdot/vexp > 1e-6 (Msun/yr)/(km/s), the radial extent of SiO, CS, and SiS are similar, while at low envelope densities, Mdot/vexp CS -> SiO. We also find a tentative dependence of the radial extent with the chemical type (O- or C-rich) of the star for SiO and CS. Interferometric observations and further investigation of the photodissociation of SiO, CS, and SiS should allow to clarify the situation on the relative photodissociation radius of SiO, CS, and SiS in AGB envelopes and the dependence with envelope density and C/O ratio."

    "summary": "There is a long tradition of thinking of thermodynamics, not as a theory of fundamental physics (or even a candidate theory of fundamental physics), but as a theory of how manipulations of a physical system may be used to obtain desired effects, such as mechanical work. On this view, the basic concepts of thermodynamics, heat and work, and with them, the concept of entropy, are relative to a class of envisaged manipulations. This view has been dismissed by many philosophers of physics, in my opinion too hastily. This paper is a sketch and defense of a science of manipulations and their effects on physical systems. This is, I claim, the best way to make sense of thermodynamics as it is found in textbooks and as it is practiced. I call this science thermo-dynamics (with hyphen), or , for short, to highlight that it may be different from the science of thermodynamics, as the reader conceives it. Even if one is not convinced that it is the best way to make sense of thermodynamics as it is practiced, it should be non-controversial that is a legitimate science. An upshot of the discussion is a clarification of the roles of the Gibbs and von Neumann entropies. Given the definition of statistical thermo-dynamic entropy, it can be proven that, under the assumption of availability of thermodynamically reversible processes, these functions are the unique (up to an additive constant) functions that represent thermo-dynamic entropy. Light is also shed on the use of coarse-grained entropies."

    "title": "CS$^2$: A Controllable and Simultaneous Synthesizer of Images and Annotations with Minimal Human Intervention",
    "summary": "The destitution of image data and corresponding expert annotations limit the training capacities of AI diagnostic models and potentially inhibit their performance. To address such a problem of data and label scarcity, generative models have been developed to augment the training datasets. Previously proposed generative models usually require manually adjusted annotations (e.g., segmentation masks) or need pre-labeling. However, studies have found that these pre-labeling based methods can induce hallucinating artifacts, which might mislead the downstream clinical tasks, while manual adjustment could be onerous and subjective. To avoid manual adjustment and pre-labeling, we propose a novel controllable and simultaneous synthesizer (dubbed CS ) in this study to generate both realistic images and corresponding annotations at the same time. Our CS model is trained and validated using high resolution CT (HRCT) data collected from COVID-19 patients to realize an efficient infections segmentation with minimal human intervention. Our contributions include 1) a conditional image synthesis network that receives both style information from reference CT images and structural information from unsupervised segmentation masks, and 2) a corresponding segmentation mask synthesis network to automatically segment these synthesized images simultaneously. Our experimental studies on HRCT scans collected from COVID-19 patients demonstrate that our CS model can lead to realistic synthesized datasets and promising segmentation results of COVID infections compared to the state-of-the-art nnUNet trained and fine-tuned in a fully supervised manner."

We performed non-LTE radiative transfer calculations including collision cross sections with ortho and para H2 and with electrons. New collision cross sections with electrons were computed for ortho and para formaldehyde. The c-C3H2 line profiles are very similar to those of HCO+ and CCH, while the CS absorption features are narrower and mostly concentrated in two main velocity components at V = -17 and -10 km/s. H2CO absorption lines present an intermediate pattern with absorption in all velocity components but larger opacities in the two main velocity components. The ortho-to-para ratios of H2CO and c-C3H2 are consistent with the statistical value of 3. While the excitation temperature of all c-C3H2 velocity components is consistent with the CMB, the two strong components detected in CS show a clear excess over the CMB indicating that CS resides at higher densities than other species along this particular sightline, n(H2) ~ 2500 cm-3 while n(H2) 1e-4."

Both (1) and (2) have been formally verified in the proof assistant Agda. The Reidemeister-Schreier theorem gives a constructive method for computing a presentation of a sub-monoid given a presentation of the super-monoid. To achieve (2), we devise an almost-normal form for Clifford+CS operators. Along the way, we also identify several interesting structures within the Clifford+CS group. Specifically, we identify three different finite subgroups for whose elements we can give unique normal forms. We show that the 3-qubit Clifford+CS group, which is of course infinite, is the amalgamated product of these three finite subgroups. This result is analogous to the fact that the 1-qubit Clifford+T group is an amalgamated product of two finite subgroups."

In particular, we measure blue- and red-shifted emission for the Cs- and Pb-rich phases, respectively, stemming from embedded CsPbBr nanocrystals.

Excellent agreement with observed data in Saßmannshausen et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 133201(2015)] in line positions and profiles is obtained. We also determine the spin-dependent permanent electric dipole moments for these molecules. This is the first such calculation of ultralong-range Rydberg molecules in which all of the relativistic contributions are accounted for."

    "summary": "We have observed several new spectral features in the fluorescence of cesium atoms implanted in the hcp phase of solid helium following laser excitation to the 6 P states. Based on calculations of the emission spectra using semiempirical Cs-He pair potentials the newly discovered lines can be assigned to the decay of specific Cs*He exciplexes: an apple-shaped Cs He and a dumbbell-shaped Cs He exciplex with a well defined number of bound helium atoms. While the former has been observed in other enviroments, it was commonly believed that exciplexes with might not exist. The calculations suggest Cs He to be the most probable candidate for that exciplex, in which the helium atoms are arranged on a ring around the waist of the dumbbell shaped electronic density distribution of the cesium atom."

We have supplemented these data with a ground based study in the atmospheric M band around 4.5 m using the iSHELL instrument on the Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF), and the full N band window from 8-13 m using the Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph (TEXES) on the IRTF. Here we present the first detection of ro-vibrational transitions of CS in this source. The absorption lines are centred on average around -10 kms and the line widths of CS compare well with the hot component of CO (around 10 kms ). Temperatures for CS, hot CO and CO v=1-2 agree well and are around 700 K. We derive a CS abundance of 8 10 and 2 10 with respect to CO and H respectively. This enhanced CS abundance with respect to the surrounding cloud (1 10 ) may reflect sublimation of H S ice followed by gas-phase reactions to form CS. Transitions are in LTE and we derive a density of 10 cm , which corresponds to an absorbing region of 0.04 . EXES observations of CS are likely to probe deeply into the hot core, to the base of the outflow. Submillimeter and infrared observations trace different components of the hot core as revealed by the difference in systemic velocities, line widths and temperatures, as well as the CS abundance."

    "summary": "Efficient channel state information at transmitter (CSIT) for frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO can facilitate its backward compatibility with existing FDD cellular networks. To date, several CSIT estimation schemes have been proposed for FDD single-cell massive MIMO systems, but they fail to consider inter-cell-interference (ICI) and suffer from downlink pilot contamination in multi-cell scenario. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a compressive sensing (CS)-based CSIT estimation scheme to combat ICI in FDD multi-cell massive MIMO systems. Specifically, angle-domain massive MIMO channels exhibit the common sparsity over different subcarriers, and such sparsity is partially shared by adjacent users. By exploiting these sparsity properties, we design the pilot signal and the associated channel estimation algorithm under the framework of CS theory, where the channels associated with multiple adjacent BSs can be reliably estimated with low training overhead for downlink pilot decontamination. Simulation results verify the good downlink pilot decontamination performance of the proposed solution compared to its conventional counterparts in multi-cell FDD massive MIMO."

Under mild assumptions, we show that the support recovery error of both algorithms is bounded by a time-invariant and small value at all times. The same is also true for the reconstruction error. Under a slow support change assumption, (i) the support recovery error bound is small compared to the support size; and (ii) our results hold under weaker assumptions on the number of measurements than what minimization for noisy data needs. We first give a general result that only assumes a bound on support size, number of support changes and number of small magnitude nonzero entries at each time. Later, we specialize the main idea of these results for two sets of signal change assumptions that model the class of problems in which a new element that is added to the support either gets added at a large initial magnitude or its magnitude slowly increases to a large enough value within a finite delay. Simulation experiments are shown to back up our claims."

    "title": "CS-Net:Contribution-based Sampling Network for Point Cloud Simplification",
    "summary": "Point cloud sampling plays a crucial role in reducing computation costs and storage requirements for various vision tasks. Traditional sampling methods, such as farthest point sampling, lack task-specific information and, as a result, cannot guarantee optimal performance in specific applications. Learning-based methods train a network to sample the point cloud for the targeted downstream task. However, they do not guarantee that the sampled points are the most relevant ones. Moreover, they may result in duplicate sampled points, which requires completion of the sampled point cloud through post-processing techniques. To address these limitations, we propose a contribution-based sampling network (CS-Net), where the sampling operation is formulated as a Top-k operation. To ensure that the network can be trained in an end-to-end way using gradient descent algorithms, we use a differentiable approximation to the Top-k operation via entropy regularization of an optimal transport problem. Our network consists of a feature embedding module, a cascade attention module, and a contribution scoring module. The feature embedding module includes a specifically designed spatial pooling layer to reduce parameters while preserving important features. The cascade attention module combines the outputs of three skip connected offset attention layers to emphasize the attractive features and suppress less important ones. The contribution scoring module generates a contribution score for each point and guides the sampling process to prioritize the most important ones. Experiments on the ModelNet40 and PU147 showed that CS-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance in two semantic-based downstream tasks (classification and registration) and two reconstruction-based tasks (compression and surface reconstruction)."

The qubit consists of the two magnetic-insensitive Cs clock states and , which are coupled by microwave radiation. We observe a significant enhancement of the coherence time when employing Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) dynamical decoupling. A CPMG sequence with ten refocusing pulses increases the coherence time of 16.2(9) ms by more than one order of magnitude to 178(2) ms. In addition, we make use of the filter function formalism and utilize the CPMG sequence to measure the background noise floor affecting the qubit coherence, finding a power-law noise spectrum with . This finding is in very good agreement with an independent measurement of the noise in the intensity of the trapping laser. Moreover, the measured coherence evolutions also exhibit signatures of low-frequency noise originating at distinct frequencies. Our findings point toward noise spectroscopy of engineered atomic baths through single-atom dynamical decoupling in a system of individual Cs impurities immersed in an ultracold Rb bath."

We reckon, from relativistic quantum mechanis, the effects of multichannel scattering onto weak decays, including nuclear and electronic excited states (ES) populated above 10 keV, for both parent and daughter nuclei. We find increases in the half-lives for K (by more than a factor 3 for Cs) as compared to previous works based on systematics. We also discuss our method in view of these previous calculations. An important impact on half-lives comes from nuclear ES decays, while including electronic temperatures yields further increases of about 20\\% at energies 10-30 keV, typical of AGB stars of moderate mass ( ). Despite properly considering these effects, the new rates remain sensitively lower than the TY values, implying longer half-lives at least above 8-9 keV. Our rate predictions are in substantial accord with recent results based on the shell model, and strongly modify branching ratios along the -process path previously adopted. With our new rate, nucleosynthesis models well account for the isotopic admixtures of Ba in presolar SiC grains and in the Sun."

Methods: We surveyed a sample of 25 carbon-rich AGB stars in the 2 mm band, using the IRAM 30 m telescope. We performed excitation and radiative transfer calculations based on the LVG method to model the observed lines of the molecules and to derive their fractional abundances in the observed CSEs. Results: We detected CS in all 25 CSEs, SiO in 24 of them, and SiS in 17 sources. We found that CS and SiS have similar abundances in carbon star envelopes, while SiO is present with a lower abundance. We also found a strong correlation in which the denser the envelope, the less abundant are CS and SiO. The trend is however only tentatively seen for SiS in the range of high mass loss rates. Furthermore, we found a relation in which the integrated flux of the MgS dust feature at 30 um increases as the fractional abundance of CS decreases. Conclusions: The decline in the fractional abundance of CS with increasing density could be due to gas-phase chemistry in the inner envelope or to adsorption onto dust grains. The latter possibility is favored by a correlation between the CS fractional abundance and the 30 um feature, which suggests that CS is efficiently incorporated onto MgS dust around C-rich AGB stars. In the case of SiO, the observed abundance depletion with increasing density is most likely caused by an efficient incorporation onto dust grains. We conclude that CS, SiO (very likely), and SiS (tentatively) are good candidates to act as gas-phase precursors of dust in C-rich AGB envelopes."

The recent discoveries of superconductivity at nearly room temperature in hydrides highlight the power of pressure in this aspect. Capturing such Tc superconductivity at atmosphere pressure for the technological applications is highly desired. The large-scale growth of diamond through the chemical vapor deposition away from the usual high-pressure and high-temperature conditions fuels such a hope. Similar to hydrides, Cs-doped C was also found to exhibit superconductivity by the application of pressure with a comparable Tc of 40 K as MgB . Here, we report the successful realization of superconductivity in Cs-doped C at atmosphere pressure. The phase is characterized to have the primitive cubic structure in the space group of Pa-3 with the stoichiometry of Cs C . The superconductivity is evidenced from the observations of both the Meissner effect and zero-resistance state. Although the pressure effects on superconductivity are different for the newly discovered Cs C compared to the known two phases with fcc and A15 structure, the evolution of Tc with the volume for all these superconductors follows the same universal trend, suggesting the same pairing mechanism of the superconductivity. Such a trend together with the nearly linear Tc vs the lattice constant in the structure with smaller unit-cell volumes and the neighbouring antiferromagnetic state in the structure with larger unit-cell volumes invites the electron-phonon coupling and the electron correlations together to account for the superconductivity in Cs C . The present results and findings suggest a new route to capturing the superconductivity which takes place at high pressures to atmosphere pressure environment."

    "summary": "We present CS(3-2) and DCO+(2-1) observations of 94 starless cores and compare the results with previous CS(2-1) and N2H+(1-0) observations to study inward motions in starless cores. The velocity shifts of the CS(3-2) and (2-1) lines with respect to N2H+ correlate well with each other and have similar distributions. This implies that, in many cores, systematic inward motions of gaseous material may occur over a range of density of at least a factor 4. We identify 18 infall candidates based on observations of CS(3-2), CS(2-1), DCO+(2-1) and N2H+(1-0). The eight best candidates, L1355, L1498, L1521F, L1544, L158, L492, L694-2, and L1155C-1, each show at least four indications of infall asymmetry and no counter-indications. Fits of the spectra to a 2-layer radiative transfer model in ten infall candidates suggest that the median effective line-of-sight speed of the inward-moving gas is ~0.07 km/s for CS (3-2) and ~0.04 km/s for CS(2-1). Considering that the optical depth obtained from the fits is usually smaller in CS(3-2) than in (2-1) line, this may imply that CS(3-2) usually traces inner denser gas in higher inward motions than CS(2-1). However, it is also possible that this conclusion is not representative of all starless core infall candidates, due to the statistically small number analyzed here. Further line observations will be useful to test this conclusion."

We apply this method to monolayer graphene and investigate the flat band by a combination of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiment and the calculation. Our work highlights that charge transfer, zone folding of graphene bands and the covalent bonding between C and Cs atoms are at the origin of the flat energy band formation. The presented approach is an alternative route for obtaining flat band materials to twisting bilayer graphene which yields thermodynamically stable flat band materials in large areas."

Usual 4d Einstein gravity plus a topological term (the \"Born-Infeld\" Lagrangian for gravity), is shown to be obtained by a generalized dimensional reduction from 5d Chern-Simons gravity. Chern-Simons gravity in d=2n+1 is dimensionally reduced to CS gravity in d=2n-1 via a mechanism similar to descent equations. The consistency of the dimensional reduction in both cases is analyzed. The dimensional reduction of d=2n+2 Born-Infeld gravity to d=2n BI gravity, as well as d=2n BI gravity to d=2n-1 CS gravity is hard to achieve. Thus 4d gravity (plus a topological term) can be embedded into d=2n+1 CS gravity, including 11d CS, whose supersymmetric version could possibly be related to usual 11d supergravity. This raises the hope that maybe 4d quantum Einstein gravity could be embedded in a well defined quantum theory, similar to Witten's treatment of 3d quantum Einstein gravity as a CS theory."

Furthermore, we observe that the Cs 6s electron is repelled from Cu(111) due to xenon's electron density.

    "summary": "To shed light on the properties of states whose nature, internal structure, and spin-parity quantum numbers are not fully elucidated, we systematically study their electromagnetic properties. In light of this concept, we present a comprehensive analysis of the magnetic dipole moment of the pentaquark within the context of QCD light-cone sum rules, utilizing three distinct interpolating currents in the form of diquark-diquark-antiquark configurations that are likely to couple this pentaquark with quantum numbers. The numerical analysis yielded the following results: , , and . The numerical results obtained have led to the conclusion that the magnetic dipole moments of the state are capable of projecting its inner structure. As is seen, the different diquark-diquark-antiquark configurations of the pentaquark state contain important information about its internal structure. Thus, this study will provide prominent data to investigate the inner structure of the pentaquark state. We compared our results with other theoretical predictions that could be a useful complementary tool for interpreting the nature of the state. A thorough examination reveals that the results obtained by employing disparate theoretical approaches and different internal structure models are not consistent with each other. It is recommended that further studies be conducted using alternative non-perturbative techniques to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the observed results."

    "summary": "We report simultaneous Raman sideband cooling of a single Rb atom and a single Cs atom held in separate optical tweezers at 814\\,nm and 938\\,nm, respectively. Starting from outside the Lamb-Dicke regime, after 45\\,ms of cooling we measure probabilities to occupy the three-dimensional motional ground state of 0.86 for Rb and 0.95 for Cs. Our setup overlaps the Raman laser beams used to cool Rb and Cs, reducing hardware requirements by sharing equipment along the same beam path. The cooling protocol is scalable, and we demonstrate cooling of single Rb atoms in an array of four tweezers. After motional ground-state cooling, a 938\\,nm tweezer is translated to overlap with a 814\\,nm tweezer so that a single Rb and a single Cs atom can be transferred into a common 1064\\,nm trap. By minimising the heating during the merging and transfer, we prepare the atoms in the relative motional ground state with an efficiency of 0.81 . This is a crucial step towards the formation of single RbCs molecules confined in optical tweezer arrays."

    "summary": "As a result of nuclear power plant accidents, large areas receive radioactive inputs of Cs-137. This cesium accumulates in herbs growing in such territories. The problem is whether the herbs contaminated by radiocesium may be used as a raw material for medicine. The answer depends on the amount of Cs-137 transfered from the contaminated raw material to the medicine. We have presented new results of the transfer of Cs-137 from contaminated Digitalis grandiflora Mill. and Convallaria majalis L. to medicine. We found that the extraction of Cs-137 depends strongly on the hydrophilicity of the solvent. For example 96.5%(vol.) ethyl alcohol extracts less Cs-137 (11.6%) than 40%(vol.) ethyl alcohol or pure water (66.2%). The solubility of the cardiac glycosides is inverse to the solubility of cesium, which may be of use in the technological processes for manufacturing ecologically pure herbal medicine."

Our heat capacity measurements of single-crystalline Cs TaCl , reveal a clear anomaly at the transition temperature, , which was not previously observed in polycrystalline samples. Density functional calculations indicate the emergence of local charge quadrupoles in the cubic phase, mediated by the paramagnetic spins or local structural distortions which then develop into long-range ordered charge quadrupoles in the tetragonal phase. Our resonant elastic x-ray scattering on Cs TaCl , single crystals lend support to our calculations. Our work provides new insight into the phase transition in Cs TaCl , at , and demonstrates the utility of this combination of techniques in understanding the complex physics of hidden orders in paramagnetic spin-orbit-entangled compounds."

    "summary": "Compressive sensing (CS) is a technique that enables the recovery of sparse signals using fewer measurements than traditional sampling methods. To address the computational challenges of CS reconstruction, our objective is to develop an interpretable and concise neural network model for reconstructing natural images using CS. We achieve this by mapping one step of the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA) to a deep network block, representing one iteration of ISTA. To enhance learning ability and incorporate structural diversity, we integrate aggregated residual transformations (ResNeXt) and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) mechanisms into the ISTA block. This block serves as a deep equilibrium layer, connected to a semi-tensor product network (STP-Net) for convenient sampling and providing an initial reconstruction. The resulting model, called MsDC-DEQ-Net, exhibits competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art network-based methods. It significantly reduces storage requirements compared to deep unrolling methods, using only one iteration block instead of multiple iterations. Unlike deep unrolling models, MsDC-DEQ-Net can be iteratively used, gradually improving reconstruction accuracy while considering computation trade-offs. Additionally, the model benefits from multi-scale dilated convolutions, further enhancing performance."

The deep potential has DFT-level accuracy, enabling accurate property prediction. This deep potential is employed to investigate the properties of the graphene surface solution, including the density distribution, mean square displacement, and vibrational power spectrum of water. Furthermore, calculations of the molecular orbital electron distributions indicate the presence of electron migration in the molecular orbitals of graphene and hydrated Cs+, resulting in a strong electrostatic interaction force. The method provides a powerful tool to study the adsorption behavior of hydrated cations on graphene surfaces and offers a new solution for handling radionuclides."

    "title": "Towards a Mechanism of Rattler Coupling in the β-Pyrochlores AOs2O6 (A = K, Rb, Cs)",
    "summary": "We have applied ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study metal-metal coupling on the alkali-metal sublattice in the β-pyrochlore osmates, AOs2O6 (A = K, Rb, Cs) at 300 K. We find that the alkali-metal atoms (rattlers) couple to each other more strongly than they couple to the cage atoms, and that, at 300 K, this coupling is strongest for Cs. We show that this coupling controls the dominant dynamics in the rattling of these atoms. We provide preliminary evidence that the rattlers couple to each other primarily through the T2g mode whereas their coupling to the cage modes occurs through the T1u mode. Rattler coupling through the T2g mode provides insight into the trend in spectral broadening from Cs to K. The spectral broadening is inversely proportional to the strength of the dynamical correlations on the alkali-metal sublattice which in turn depend on the atomic size of the rattler, decreasing from Cs to K. Thus, the broadest spectrum exhibited by the K is partly a consequence of the small size of this rattler which permits a greater range of motions involving combinations of both correlated and anti-correlated dynamics. We emphasize that the identification of the somewhat distinct roles of the T1u and T2g modes in rattler coupling reported in this work is a significant step towards a complete fundamental mechanism of rattler dynamical coupling in these osmates. We believe that such a mechanism will have profound implications for a broad class of cage compounds, including clathrates and skutterudites."

The continuum emission shows an elongated structure (~ 220 x 100 AU) around the binary perpendicular to the axis of the associated radio jet. The CS emission extends over ~ 400 AU, appears approximately circularly symmetric, and shows a velocity gradient from southeast (blueshifted) to northwest (redshifted). The direction of the velocity gradient is different from that observed in C18O (J=1-0). This may be because rotation is more dominant in the CS envelope than the C18O envelope, in which both infall and rotation exist. The CS emission may be divided into two velocity components: (1) a \"high\" velocity disk-like structure surrounding the protostar, +-1.0 - 1.5 km s-1 from the systemic velocity, and (2) a \"low\" velocity structure, located southwest of the protostar, < 1.0 km s -1 from the systemic velocity. The high-velocity component traces warm and dense gas with kinematics consistent with rotation around the protostar. The low-velocity component may arise from dense gas entrained in the outflow. Alternatively, this component may trace infalling and rotating gas in an envelope with a vertical structure."

In spite of the expectation that the CN and CS morphology might closely follow the dense gas traced by the dust continuum, both molecules avoid the most central cores. Comparing the relative line strengths of various CN hyperfine components, this appears not to be an opacity effect but to be due to chemical and physical effects. The CN data also indicate enhanced emission toward the different molecular outflows in the region. Regarding CS, avoiding the central cores can be due to high optical depth, but the data also show that the CS emission is nearly always associated with the outflows of the region. Therefore, neither CS nor CN appear well suited for dense gas and disk studies in these two sources, and we recommend the use of different molecules for future massive disk studies. An analysis of the 1 and 3mm continuum fluxes toward IRAS20293+3952 reveals that the dust opacity index beta is lower than the canonical value of 2. Tentatively, we identify a decreasing gradient of beta from the edge of the core to the core center. This could be due to increasing optical depth toward the core center and/or grain growth within the densest cores and potential central disks. We detect 3mm continuum emission toward the collimated outflow emanating from IRAS20293+3952. The spectral index of alpha ~ 0.8 in this region is consistent with standard models for collimated ionized winds."

To deal with both problems simultaneously, we propose a novel end-to-end Probabilistic Under-sampling and Explicable Reconstruction neTwork, dubbed PUERT, to jointly optimize the sampling pattern and the reconstruction network. Instead of learning a deterministic mask, the proposed sampling subnet explores an optimal probabilistic sub-sampling pattern, which describes independent Bernoulli random variables at each possible sampling point, thus retaining robustness and stochastics for a more reliable CS reconstruction. A dynamic gradient estimation strategy is further introduced to gradually approximate the binarization function in backward propagation, which efficiently preserves the gradient information and further improves the reconstruction quality. Moreover, in our reconstruction subnet, we adopt a model-based network design scheme with high efficiency and interpretability, which is shown to assist in further exploitation for the sampling subnet. Extensive experiments on two widely used MRI datasets demonstrate that our proposed PUERT not only achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality but also yields a sub-sampling pattern and a reconstruction model that are both customized to training data."

To better characterise and understand such rare objects, we present the first abundance estimates of three elements (Be, V, Cu) for CS 31082-001 from analysis of its near-ultraviolet spectrum. Beryllium is rarely measured in giant stars, and we confirm that its abundance in this star is low due to the rather cool effective temperature that causes destruction of both Be and Li in its atmosphere. Vanadium and copper are iron-peak elements that are starting to be used as chemical-tagging indicators to investigate the origin of stellar populations. We find V and Cu abundances for CS 31082-001 that are comparable to other metal-poor stars, and present new chemical evolution models to investigate our results. In the case of V, extra nucleosynthesis due to interaction of neutrinos with matter is included in the models to be able to reproduce the measured abundance.

This Seyfert 2 barred galaxy possesses a circumnuclear disc (CND, pc) and a starburst ring (SB ring, kpc). These high-resolution maps ( \", pc) allow us to analyse specific sub-regions in the galaxy and investigate differences in line intensity ratios and physical conditions, particularly those between the CND and SB ring. Local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) analysis of the gas is used to calculate CS densities in each sub-region, followed by non-LTE analysis conducted using the radiative transfer code RADEX to fit observations and constrain gas temperature, CS column density and hydrogen density. Finally, the chemical code UCLCHEM is used to reconstruct the gas, allowing an insight into its origin and chemical history. The density of hydrogen in the CND is found to be cm , although exact values vary, reaching cm at the AGN. The conditions in the two arms of the SB ring appear similar to one another, though the density found ( cm ) is lower than in the CND. The temperature in the CND increases from east to west, and is also overall greater than found in the SB ring. These modelling methods indicate the requirement for multi-phase gas components in order to fit the observed emission over the galaxy. A larger number of high resolution transitions across the SLED may allow for further constraining of the conditions, particularly in the SB ring."

We have got from ESO 17 hours of additional exposure on this star in order to secure a detection of the minimum amount of lead expected to be present in CS 31082-001, the amount arising from the decay of the original content of Th and U in the star. We report here this successful detection. We find an LTE abundance log(Pb/H)+12=-0.55 0.15 dex, one dex below the upper limits given by other authors for the similar stars CS 22892-052 and BD +17d3248, also enhanced in r-process elements. From the observed present abundances of Th and U in the star, the expected amount of Pb produced by the decay of 232Th, and 238U alone, over 12-15 Gyr is -0.73 0.17 dex. The decay of 235U is more difficult to estimate, but is probably slightly below the contribution of 238U, making the contribution of the 3 actinides only slightly below, or even equal to, the measured abundance. The contribution from the decay of 234U has was not included, for lack of published data. In this sense our determination is a lower limit to the contribution of actinides to lead production. We comment this result, and we note that if a NLTE analysis, not yet possible, doubles our observed abundance, the decay of the 3 actinides will still represent 50 per cent of the total lead, a proportion higher than the values considered so far in the literature."

A model based on M/M/1 queues is proposed in [1] to capture the communication between the forwarding element and the controller. Albeit the model provides useful insight, it is accurate only for the case when the probability of expecting a new flow is small. Secondly, it is not straight forward to extend the model in [1] to more than one forwarding element in the data plane. In this work we propose a model which addresses both these challenges. The model is based on Jackson assumption but with corrections tailored to the OpenFlow based SDN network. Performance analysis using the proposed model indicates that the model is accurate even for the case when the probability of new flow is quite large. Further we show by a toy example that the model can be extended to more than one node in the data plane."

We performed ab initio calculations to characterize the main features of all the electronic states correlating to the open shell reactants. For CH+S we have calculated the full potential energy surfaces for the lowest doublet states and the reaction rate constant with a quasi-classical method. For C_2+S, the reaction can only take place through the three lower triplet states, which all present deep insertion wells. A detailed study of the long-range interactions for these triplet states allowed to apply a statistic adiabatic method to determine the rate constants. This study of the CH + S reaction shows that its rate is nearly independent on the temperature in a range of 10-500 K with an almost constant value of 5.5 10^ -11 cm^3/s at temperatures above 100~K. This is a factor 2-3 lower than the value obtained with the capture model. The rate of the reaction C_2 + S depends on the temperature taking values close to 2.0 10^ -10 cm^3/s at low temperatures and increasing to 5. 10^ -10 cm^3/s for temperatures higher than 200~K. Our modeling provides a rate higher than the one currently used by factor of 2. These reactions were selected for involving open-shell species with many degenerate electronic states, and the results obtained in the present detailed calculations provide values which differ a factor of 2-3 from the simpler classical capture method. We have updated the sulphur network with these new rates and compare our results in the prototypical case of TMC1 (CP). We find a reasonable agreement between model predictions and observations with a sulphur depletion factor of 20 relative to the sulphur cosmic abundance, but it is not possible to fit all sulphur-bearing molecules better than a factor of 10 at the same chemical time."

    "title": "PLLM-CS: Pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) for Cyber Threat Detection in Satellite Networks",
    "summary": "Satellite networks are vital in facilitating communication services for various critical infrastructures. These networks can seamlessly integrate with a diverse array of systems. However, some of these systems are vulnerable due to the absence of effective intrusion detection systems, which can be attributed to limited research and the high costs associated with deploying, fine-tuning, monitoring, and responding to security breaches. To address these challenges, we propose a pretrained Large Language Model for Cyber Security , for short PLLM-CS, which is a variant of pre-trained Transformers [1], which includes a specialized module for transforming network data into contextually suitable inputs. This transformation enables the proposed LLM to encode contextual information within the cyber data. To validate the efficacy of the proposed method, we conducted empirical experiments using two publicly available network datasets, UNSW_NB 15 and TON_IoT, both providing Internet of Things (IoT)-based traffic data. Our experiments demonstrate that proposed LLM method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques such as BiLSTM, GRU, and CNN. Notably, the PLLM-CS method achieves an outstanding accuracy level of 100% on the UNSW_NB 15 dataset, setting a new standard for benchmark performance in this domain."

The CPT signal is observed on the Cs D1 line transmission, using a double scheme and a Ramsey interrogation technique. The effects on the clock frequency of the magnetic field, the cell temperature, and the laser intensities are reported. We show in particular that the laser intensity shift is temperature dependent. Along with the laser intensity ratio and laser polarization properties, this is one of the most important parameters."

    "summary": "The SPIDER H-/D- ion source is currently in operation in the Neutral Beam Test facility (NBTF) at Consorzio RFX (Padova, Italy) to prove the possibility of generating up to 40 A of negative ions, with a maximum extracted current density of 350 A/m2 (H)/285 A/m2 (D) and a fraction of co-extracted electrons not greater than 0.5 (H)/1 (D). These performances are required for the realization of the ITER Neutral Beam Injector (NBI), which should deliver 16.7 MW to the plasma by means of negative ions accelerated up to 1 MeV and neutralized before being injected into the ITER tokamak. In order to obtain such high extracted current densities and low co-extracted electron fractions it is necessary to lower the work function of the surface of the acceleration system grid facing the source; this will be accomplished by coating the surfaces with Cs, routinely evaporated by three ovens. The functionality of the ovens has been tested at the CAesium oven Test Stand (CATS), hosted at NBTF. The test stand is equipped with several diagnostics, among which a Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (LAS) diagnostic. Using a tunable laser diode, the LAS diagnostic gets the high resolution absorption spectrum of the Cs 852 nm D2 line along a line of sight to measure Cs density at ground state. The paper describes the test stand and the LAS diagnostic, together with the characterization of the ovens to be installed in SPIDER. The paper will also study the systematic density underestimation effect caused by Cs ground state depopulation, as a function of laser intensity and of Cs density, in the perspective of correcting the density evaluation."

For theoretical analysis we used a model that is based on the Optical Bloch equations for the density matrix. Our model includes the interaction of all neighboring hyperfine levels with laser radiation, the mixing of magnetic sublevels in an external magnetic field, the coherence properties of the exciting laser radiation, and the Doppler effect. Additionally we simulated signals where the ground- or the excited-state coherent processes were numerically switched off in order to determine the origins of the features of the obtained signals. We also performed experiments on Cs atoms with two laser beams: a linearly polarized Cs pump and circularly polarized Cs probe. We used the pump beam to create angular momentum alignment in the ground state and observed the transmission signal of the probe beam as we changed the magnetic field. A detailed analysis of the experimentally obtained transmission signal from a single circularly polarized probe laser component is provided. Finally, prospects for observing AOC conversion experimentally are discussed, as well as experiments were even a weak AOC signal could lead to systematic errors."

    "summary": "Observations of various molecular lines toward a disk region of a nearby galaxy are now feasible, and they are being employed as diagnostic tools to study star-formation activities there. However, the spatial resolution attainable for a nearby galaxy with currently available radio telescopes is pc, which is much larger than the scales of individual star-forming regions and molecular cloud cores. Hence, it is of fundamental importance to elucidate which part of an interstellar medium such spatially-unresolved observations are tracing. Here we present sensitive measurements of the H CO ( ) line at 72 GHz toward giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in the spiral arm of M51 using the NRO 45 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes. In conjunction with the previously observed H CO ( ) and CS ( and ) lines, we derive the H density of the emitting regions to be cm and cm for H CO and CS, respectively, by the non-LTE analyses, where we assume the source size of kpc and the gas kinetic temperature of K. The derived H density indicates that the emission of H CO and CS is not localized to star-forming cores, but is likely distributed over an entire region of GMCs. Such widespread distributions of H CO and CS are also supported by models assuming lognormal density distributions over the 1 kpc region. Thus, contributions from the widespread less-dense components should be taken into account for interpretation of these molecular emission observed with a GMC-scale resolution. The different H densities derived for H CO and CS imply their different distributions. We discuss this differences in terms of the formation processes of H CO and CS."

The algorithm computes two polar decompositions (which can be carried out in parallel) followed by an eigendecomposition of a judiciously crafted Hermitian matrix. We prove that the algorithm is backward stable whenever the aforementioned decompositions are computed in a backward stable way. Since the polar decomposition and the symmetric eigendecomposition are highly amenable to parallelization, the algorithm inherits this feature. We illustrate this fact by invoking recently developed algorithms for the polar decomposition and symmetric eigendecomposition that leverage Zolotarev's best rational approximations of the sign function. Numerical examples demonstrate that the resulting algorithm for computing the CS decomposition enjoys excellent numerical stability."

Intermediate coverages are characterized by incommensurate superstructures which are rotated with respect to the substrate lattice. The rotation behavior at 9K follows a general trend which is consistent with models of epitaxial rotation.

We detect CS towards all the surveyed carbon stars, some S-type stars, and the highest mass-loss rate oxygen-rich stars ( Msol yr ). SiS is detected towards the highest mass-loss rate sources of all chemical types ( Msol yr ). We find CS peak fractional abundances ranging from ~ to ~ for the carbon stars, from ~ to ~ for the oxygen-rich stars and from ~ to ~ for the S-type stars. We find SiS peak fractional abundances ranging from ~ to ~ for the carbon stars, from ~ to ~ for the oxygen-rich stars, and from ~ to ~ for the S-type stars. We derived Si S/Si S = 11.4 for AI Vol, the only star for which we had a reliable isotopologue detection. Overall, we find that wind density plays an important role in determining the chemical composition of AGB CSEs. It is seen that for oxygen-rich AGB stars both CS and SiS are detected only in the highest density circumstellar envelopes and their abundances are generally lower than for carbon-rich AGB stars by around an order of magnitude.

    "summary": "Ultralong-range Rydberg trimer molecules are spectroscopically observed in an ultracold gas of Cs( ) atoms. The atomic Rydberg state anisotropy allows for the formation of angular trimer states, whose energies may not be obtained from integer multiples of dimer energies. These nonadditive trimers are predicted to coexist with Rydberg dimer lines. The existence of such effective three-body interactions is confirmed with observation of asymmetric line profiles and interpreted by a theoretical approach which includes relativistic spin interactions. Simulations of the observed spectra with and without angular trimer lines lends convincing support to the existence of effective three-body interactions."

    "summary": "High-resolution spectra obtained with three ground-based facilities and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have been combined to produce a new abundance analysis of CS 22892-052, an extremely metal-poor giant with large relative enhancements of neutron-capture elements. A revised model stellar atmosphere has been derived with the aid of a large number of Fe-peak transitions, including both neutral and ionized species of six elements.Several elements, including Mo, Lu, Au, Pt and Pb, have been detected for the first time in CS 22892-052, and significant upper limits have been placed on the abundances of Ga, Ge, Cd, Sn, and U in this star. In total, abundance measurements or upper limits have been determined for 57 elements, far more than previously possible. New Be and Li detections in CS 22892-052 indicate that the abundances of both these elements are significantly depleted compared to unevolved main-sequence turnoff stars of similar metallicity. Abundance comparisons show an excellent agreement between the heaviest n-capture elements (Z >= 56) and scaled solar system r-process abundances, confirming earlier results for CS 22892-052 and other metal-poor stars. New theoretical r-process calculations also show good agreement with CS 22892-052 abundances as well as the solar r-process abundance components.The abundances of lighter elements (40<= Z <= 50), however, deviate from the same scaled abundance curves that match the heavier elements, suggesting different synthesis conditions or sites for the low-mass and high-mass ends of the abundance distribution. The detection of Th and the upper limit on the U abundance together imply a lower limit of 10.4 Gyr on the age of CS 22892-052, quite consistent with the Th/Eu age estimate of 12.8 +/- ~= 3 Gyr. An average of several chronometric ratios yields an age 14.2 +/- ~= 3 Gyr."

Depletion of Al, Si, S and a low upper limit for Fe show the star to be intrinsically metal-poor.

    "summary": "We present the results of an extensive mapping survey of 53 `starless' cores in the optically thick line of CS 2-1 and the optically thin lines of N2H+ 1-0 and C18O 1-0. The purpose of this survey was to search for signatures of extended inward motions. This study finds 10 `strong' and 9 `probable' infall candidates, based on analysis and on the spectral shapes of CS lines. From our analysis of the blue-skewed CS spectra and the parameter, we find typical infall radii of 0.06-0.14 pc. Also, using a simple two layer radiative transfer model to fit the profiles, we derive one-dimensional infall speeds, half of whose values lie in the range of 0.05-0.09 km s . These values are similar to those found in L1544 by Tafalla et al., and this result confirms that infall speeds in starless cores are generally faster than expected from ambipolar diffusion in a strongly sub-critical core. In addition, the observed infall regions are too extended to be consistent with the `inside-out' collapse model applied to a very low-mass star. In the largest cores, the spatial extent of the CS spectra with infall asymmetry is larger than the extent of the core by a factor of 2-3. All these results suggest that extended inward motions are a common feature in starless cores, and that they could represent a necessary stage in the condensation of a star-forming dense core."

Although the existence of the CSD has been recognized since 1977, prior algorithms compute only a reduced version (the 2-by-1 CSD) that is equivalent to two simultaneous singular value decompositions. The algorithm presented here computes the complete 2-by-2 CSD, which requires the simultaneous diagonalization of all four blocks of a unitary matrix partitioned into a 2-by-2 block structure. The algorithm appears to be the only fully specified algorithm available. The computation occurs in two phases. In the first phase, the unitary matrix is reduced to bidiagonal block form, as described by Sutton and Edelman. In the second phase, the blocks are simultaneously diagonalized using techniques from bidiagonal SVD algorithms of Golub, Kahan, and Demmel. The algorithm has a number of desirable numerical features."

Currently, ENEA is investigating the feasibility of a superconducting solution for the magnet system. This paper focuses on the analysis of the CS (Central Solenoid) magnet thermal behavior. In particular, considering a superconducting solution for the CS which uses the room available in the resistive design and referring to one of the most severe scenario envisaged for FAST, the heat load of the CS winding pack due to AC losses is preliminarily evaluated.

The observations provide informations on the spatial and velocity distributions of these molecules. They can be used to constrain their photodissociation rate and their origin. We use a radiative transfer code which allows us to compute synthetic line profiles and interferometric maps, to be compared to the observations. Both single-dish spectra and interferometric spectral maps show a day/night asymmetry in the outgassing. From the analysis of the spectral maps, including the astrometry, we show that SO and CS present in addition a jet-like structure that may be the gaseous counterpart of the dust high-latitude jet observed in optical images. A CS rotating jet is also observed. Using the astrometry provided by continuum radio maps obtained in parallel, we conclude that there is no need to invoke of nongravitational forces acting on this comet, and provide an updated orbit. The radial extension of H2S is found to be consistent with direct release from the nucleus. SO displays an extended radial distribution. Assuming that SO2 is the parent of SO, the photodissociation rate of SO is measured to be 1.5 E-4 s-1 at 1 AU from the Sun. This is lower than most laboratory-based estimates and may suggest that SO is not solely produced by SO2 photolysis. From the observations of J(2-1) and J(5-4) CS lines, we deduce a CS photodissociation rate of 1 to 5 E-5 s-1. The photodissociation rate of CS2, the likely parent of CS, cannot be constrained due to insufficient resolution, but our data are consistent with published values. These observations illustrate the cometary science that will be performed with the future ALMA interferometer."

We construct a model for the inner disk regions and compare the resulting synthetic SED with IRS spectra of CS Cha taken at two different epochs. For our model we adopt a non-axisymmetric mass distribution from results of published numerical simulations of the interaction between a circumbinary disk and a binary system, where each star is surrounded by a disk. In particular, we approximate the streams of mass from which the inner circumstellar disks accrete from the circumbinary disk. This structure is due to the gravitational interaction of the stars with the disk, in which an array of disks and streams are formed in an inner hole. We calculate the temperature distribution of the optically thin dust in these inner regions considering the variable impinging radiation from both stars and use the observations to estimate the mass variations in the streams. We find that the SEDs for both epochs can be explained with emission from an optically thick inner edge of the circumbinary disk and from the optically thin streams that connect the circumbinary disk with the two smaller circumstellar disks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the emission from the optically thin material in the hole, suggested by the theory, is tested against observations of a binary system."

    "summary": "Atom interferometry is amongst the most advanced technologies that provides very high-precision measurements. There can exist a number of obscure forces that can interfere with the atoms used in this instrument. In the present work, we are probing possible roles of one such important forces, known as ``blackbody friction force (BBFF)'', that may affect the precisions in the measurements made using atom interferometers based on the Rb and Cs atoms. The BBFF can be generated on atoms due to the black-body radiations emitted by the stray electromagnetic fields present in the experimental set-up and other metallic shielding. The strength of the BBFF can be calculated by integrating the complex parts of the dynamic polarizabilities of atoms, which show varying behaviour at the resonant and non-resonant transitions in the above atoms. Our analyses suggest that the off-resonant atomic transitions make significant contributions to the BBFF at low temperatures in the Rb and Cs atom interferometers. Present study also advocates that it is imperative to carry out the integration over a wide spectrum of frequencies for correct evaluation of the BBFF; specially at higher temperatures."

It is very abundant in heavy elements (e.g., [La/Fe]=2.2), and its relatively cool temperature and low gravity mean that there are many lines of interesting elements present in the spectrum. We measured the abundances of 22 elements with Z>29, including the rarely measured Lu and Pd. We derive an upper limit on the Th abundance as well. The abundances in CS 31062-050 show a similar pattern to many other metal-poor CH stars: high [Pb/Fe] and [Pb/La] ratios, low [Y/La] ratios and high [Eu/La] values compared to the solar system s-process. However, the Th limit, with additional assumptions, is not consistent with the idea that the excess Eu in CS 31062-050 is contributed by the r-process. In addition, the observed [Eu/Tb] cannot be explained by any ratio of solar-system s-process and r-process abundances. We therefore argue that the abundance pattern in CS 31062-050 is most likely the result of the s-process, and we discuss possible modifications that could explain the non-solar-system pattern observed."

The CS line velocities are used to determine the kinematic distances of the sources, in order to investigate their distribution in the galactic plane. This allows us to use 870 objects to trace the arms, a number larger than that of previous studies based on classical HII regions. The distance ambiguity of the kinematic distances, when it exists, is solved by different procedures, including the latitude distribution and an analysis of the longitude-velocity diagram. The well defined spiral arms are seen to be confined inside the co-rotation radius, as is often the case in spiral galaxies. We identify a square-shaped sub-structure in the CS map with that predicted by stellar orbits at the 4:1 resonance (4 epicycle oscillations in one turn around the galactic center). The sub-structure is found at the expected radius, based on the known pattern rotation speed and epicycle frequency curve. An inner arm presents an end with strong inward curvature and intense star formation that we tentatively associate with the region where this arm surrounds the extremity of the bar, as seen in many barred galaxies. Finally, a new arm with concave curvature is found in the Sagitta to Cepheus region of the sky."

However, the large uncertainties of photodissociation cross sections and rates of CS, resulting from a lack of both laboratory experiments and theoretical calculations, limit the accuracy of calculated abundances of S-bearing molecules by modern astrochemical models. Here we show a detailed ab initio study of CS photodissociation. Accurate potential energy curves of CS electronic states were obtained by choosing an active space CAS(8,10) in MRCI+Q/aug-cc-pV(5+d)Z calculation with additional diffuse functions, with a focus on the \\(B\\) and \\(C\\,^1Σ^+\\) states. Cross sections for both direct photodissociation and predissociation from the vibronic ground state were calculated by applying the coupled-channel method.

    "summary": "The major chemical feature of an element is the number of electrons available for forming chemical bonds. A doctrine rooted in the atomic shell model states that the atoms will maintain a complete inner shell while interacting with other atoms. Therefore, group IA elements, for example, are invariably stable in the +1 charge state because the p electrons of their inner shells do not react with other chemical species. This general rule governs our understanding of the structures and reactions of matter and has never been challenged. In this work, we show for the first time that while mixing with fluorine under pressure, Cs atoms will share their 5p electrons and become oxidized to a higher charge state. The formal oxidation state can be as high as +5 within the pressure range of our study (<200 GPa) and stable Cs2+ and Cs3+ compounds can form at lower pressures. While sharing its 5p electrons, Cs behaves like a p-block element forming compounds with molecular, covalent, ionic and metallic features. Considering the pressure range required for the CsFn compounds, the inner shell electrons in other group IA and IIA elements may also bond with F or other chemical species under higher pressure."

As datasets grow larger, it becomes crucial to identify the examples that contribute the most to learning such representations. This enables efficient SSL by reducing the volume of data required. Nevertheless, quantifying the value of examples for SSL has remained an open question. In this work, we address this problem for the first time, by proving that examples that contribute the most to contrastive SSL are those that have the most similar augmentations to other examples, in expectation. We provide rigorous guarantees for the generalization performance of contrastive learning on such subsets. Through extensive experiments, we show that we can safely exclude 20% of examples from CIFAR100 and 40% from STL10 and TinyImageNet, without affecting downstream task performance. In general, subsets selected by our method outperform random subsets by over 3% across these datasets. Interestingly, we also discover the subsets that contribute the most to contrastive learning are those that contribute the least to supervised learning.

Compared with single CNN classifier, combining the results of multiple classifiers via fusion approaches shows to be more effective and robust. Since the skin lesion datasets are usually limited and statistically biased, while designing an effective fusion approach, it is important to consider not only the performance of each classifier on the training/validation dataset, but also the relative discriminative power (e.g., confidence) of each classifier regarding an individual sample in the testing phase, which calls for an active fusion approach. Furthermore, in skin lesion analysis, the data of certain classes (e.g., the benign lesions) is usually abundant making them an over-represented majority, while the data of some other classes (e.g., the cancerous lesions) is deficient, making them an underrepresented minority. It is more crucial to precisely identify the samples from an underrepresented (i.e., in terms of the amount of data) but more important minority class (e.g., certain cancerous lesion). In other words, misclassifying a more severe lesion to a benign or less severe lesion should have relative more cost (e.g., money, time and even lives). To address such challenges, we present CS-AF, a cost-sensitive multi-classifier active fusion framework for skin lesion classification. In the experimental evaluation, we prepared 96 base classifiers (of 12 CNN architectures) on the ISIC research datasets.

Our 3D MOT setup allows full horizontal optical access to the trapped atomic ensembles without spatial interference from the trapping or repump laser beams. Moreover, the red detuning for trapping both atomic species is smaller than in traditional configurations. This system offers a versatile platform for exploring complex phenomena in ultracold atom physics, such as Rydberg molecule formation and interspecies interactions."

The structures of the two decompositions are analyzed in detail and are consistent with those for matrix cases. Then the corresponding algorithms are proposed respectively. Finally, T-GSVD can be used to give the explicit expression for the solution of tensor Tikhonov regularization.

    "title": "Synthetic Text Generation for Training Large Language Models via Gradient Matching",
    "summary": "Synthetic data has the potential to improve the performance, training efficiency, and privacy of real training examples. Nevertheless, existing approaches for synthetic text generation are mostly heuristics and cannot generate human-readable text without compromising the privacy of real data, or provide performance guarantees for training Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we propose the first theoretically rigorous approach for generating synthetic human-readable text that provides convergence, performance, and privacy guarantees for fine-tuning LLMs on a target task. To do so, we leverage Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) that iteratively optimizes the embeddings of synthetic examples to match the noisy gradient of the target training or validation data, and maps them to a sequence of text tokens with low perplexity. In doing so, the generated synthetic text guarantees convergence of the model to a close neighborhood of the solution obtained by fine-tuning on real data and preserves their privacy. Experiments on various classification tasks confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/BigML-CS-UCLA/GRADMM."

For a finitely generated module M with projective socle over a V -ring R such that every subfactor of M is a direct sum of a projective module and a CS or noetherian module, we show M = X T, where X is semisimple and T is noetherian with zero socle. In the case that M = R, we get R = S T, where S is a semisimple artinian ring, and T is a direct sum of right noetherian simple rings with zero socle. In addition, if R is a von Neumann regular ring, then it is semisimple artinian."

The accidental near degeneracy of and Rydberg states for in Cs, due to the small fractional quantum defect, leads to non-adiabatic coupling among these states, producing potential wells above the thresholds. Two important consequences of admixing high angular momentum states with states are the formation of large permanent dipole moments, Debye, and accessibility of these states via two-photon association.

Based on the binding energies and complementary atom loss spectroscopy of three other Li-Cs s-wave Feshbach resonances we construct precise molecular singlet and triplet electronic ground state potentials using a coupled-channels calculation. We extract the Li-Cs interspecies scattering length as a function of the external field and obtain almost a ten-fold improvement in the precision of the values for the pole positions and widths of the s-wave Li-Cs Feshbach resonances as compared to our previous work [Pires et al. , Phys.

We carry out coupled-channel scattering calculations and show that at typical experimental temperatures the loss features are mostly centred on zeroes in the scattering length, rather than resonance centres. We measure the number of atoms remaining after a collision, elucidating how the different loss processes are influenced by the tweezer depth. These measurements probe the energy released during an inelastic collision, and thus give information on the states of the collision products. We also identify resonances with atom pairs prepared in the absolute ground state , where two-body radiative loss is engineered by an excitation laser blue-detuned from the Cs D line. These results demonstrate optical tweezers to be a versatile tool to study two-body collisions with number-resolved detection sensitivity."

Herein it is argued that these two compounds under pressure represent the optimal materials of the C family, and that the C -associated superconductivity is mediated through Coulombic interactions with charges on the alkalis. A derivation of the interlayer Coulombic pairing model of high- superconductivity employing non-planar geometry is introduced, generalizing the picture of two interacting layers to an interaction between charge reservoirs located on the C and alkali ions. The optimal transition temperature follows the algebraic expression, = (12.474 nm K)/ , where relates to the mean spacing between interacting surface charges on the C and is the average radial distance between the C surface and the neighboring Cs ions. Values of for the measured cation stoichiometries of Cs C with x 0 are found to be 38.19 and 36.88 K for the A15 and fcc forms, respectively, with the dichotomy in transition temperature reflecting the larger and structural disorder in the fcc form.

In particular, Cs BiAgX (X = Cl, Br) have been synthesized and found to exhibit band gaps in the visible range. However, the band gaps of these compounds are indirect, which is not ideal for applications in thin film photovoltaics. Here, we propose a new class of halide double perovskites, where the B and B cations are In and Ag , respectively. Our first-principles calculations indicate that the hypothetical compounds Cs InAgX (X = Cl, Br, I) should exhibit direct band gaps between the visible (I) and the ultraviolet (Cl). Based on these predictions, we attempt to synthesize Cs InAgCl and Cs InAgBr , and we succeed to form the hitherto unknown double perovskite Cs InAgCl . X-ray diffraction yields a double perovskite structure with space group . The measured band gap is 3.3 eV, and the compound is found to be photosensitive and turns reversibly from white to orange under ultraviolet illumination.

It is widely and since long time believed that upon compression at several GPa a polymeric chain of type (-(C=S)-S-) named Bridgman's black polymer will form. By combining optical spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction data with ab initio simulations, we demonstrate that the structure of the Bridgman's black polymer is remarkably different. Solid molecular CS undergoes a pressure-induced structural transformation at around 10-11 GPa, developing a disordered polymeric system. The polymer consists of 3-fold and 4-fold coordinated carbon atoms with an average carbon coordination continuously increasing upon further compression to 40 GPa. Polymerization also gives rise to some C=C double bonds. Upon decompression, the structural changes are partially reverted, a very small amount of molecular CS is recovered, while the sample undergoes partial chemical disproportionation. Our work uncovers the non-trivial high-pressure structural evolution in one of the simplest molecular systems exhibiting molecular as well as polymeric phases."

It is found that while Cs atoms have no effect on the electronic structure, their presence is essential for the formation of stable CsPb2Br5 crystals. Calculated vibrational spectra of the crystal reveal that not only the bulk form but also the single-layer forms of CsPb2Br5 are dynamically stable. Predicted single-layer forms can exhibit either semiconducting or metallic character. Moreover, modification of the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of single-layer CsPb2Br5 upon formation of vacancy defects is investigated. It is found that the formation of Br vacancy (i) has the lowest formation energy, (ii) significantly changes the electronic structure, and (iii) leads to ferromagnetic ground state in the single-layer CsPb2Br5 . However, the formation of Pb and Cs vacancies leads to p-type doping of the single-layer structure. Results reported herein reveal that single-layer CsPb2Br5 crystal is a novel stable perovskite with enhanced functionality and a promising candidate for nanodevice applications."

    "title": "Beyond Semantic Entropy: Boosting LLM Uncertainty Quantification with Pairwise Semantic Similarity",
    "summary": "Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) can be detected by assessing the uncertainty of model outputs, typically measured using entropy. Semantic entropy (SE) enhances traditional entropy estimation by quantifying uncertainty at the semantic cluster level. However, as modern LLMs generate longer one-sentence responses, SE becomes less effective because it overlooks two crucial factors: intra-cluster similarity (the spread within a cluster) and inter-cluster similarity (the distance between clusters). To address these limitations, we propose a simple black-box uncertainty quantification method inspired by nearest neighbor estimates of entropy. Our approach can also be easily extended to white-box settings by incorporating token probabilities. Additionally, we provide theoretical results showing that our method generalizes semantic entropy. Extensive empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness compared to semantic entropy across two recent LLMs (Phi3 and Llama3) and three common text generation tasks: question answering, text summarization, and machine translation.

In analogy to the deuteron, the light-mesons usually considered include the pion, sigma, rho and omega, but not the axial meson . Though it has been argued in the past that the coupling of the axial meson to the nucleons is indeed strong, its mass is considerably heavier than that of the vector mesons and thus its exchange ends up being suppressed. Yet, this is not necessarily the case in heavy hadrons molecules: we find that even though the contribution to binding from the axial meson is modest, it cannot be neglected in the isovector sector where vector meson exchange cancels out. This might provide a natural binding mechanism for molecular candidates such as the , or the more recently observed . However the is more dependent on a mixture of different factors, which (besides axial meson exchange) include exchange and the nature of scalar meson exchange.

The orbital reflex motion was later confirmed with radial velocity measurements. Using eight years of data collected with the Skynet Robotic Telescope Network, we show that the pulsation amplitude of CS 1246 is decaying nonlinearly. We also present an updated O-C diagram, which might now indicate a positive and a new yr oscillation consistent with orbital reflex motion of the entire inner sdB+dM binary, possibly due to the gravitational influence of a circumbinary planet with minimum mass . However, unlike the presence of the M dwarf, we hesitate to claim this object as a definitive detection since intrinsic variability of the pulsation phase could theoretically produce a similar effect."

Specifically, we first consider the 3-dimensional Abelian gauge theory, with a Maxwell term and a l evel CS term. We find a static solution that carries charge , angular momentum and whose radius is independent. However, this solution has a divergent energy. In analogy to the replacement of the 4 dimensional Maxwell action with the BI action, which renders the classical energy of a point charge finite, for the 3 dimensional theory which includes a CS term such a replacement leads to a finite energy for the solution of above. We refer to this soliton as a CSBIon solution, representing a finite energy version of the fundamental (sourced) charged electron of Maxwell theory in 4 dimensions. In 3 dimensions the BI+CS action has a static charged solution with finite energy and no source, hence a soliton solution. The CSBIon, similar to its Maxwellian predecessor, has a charge , angular momentum proportional to and an -independent radius. We also present other nonlinear modifications of Maxwell theory that admit similar solitons. The CSBIon may be relevant in various holographic scenarios.

Mechanical and thermal fragility of fluoride windows make common designs of vapour cells unpractical, so that we have developed an all-sapphire sealed cell with an internal CaF2 window. Although impurities were accidentally introduced when filling-up the prototype cell, leading to a line-broadening and shift, the selective reflection spectrum on the Cs D1 line (894 nm) makes apparent the weak van der Waals surface interaction. The uncertainties introduced by the effects of these impurities in the van der Waals measurement are nearly eliminated when comparing the selective reflection signal at the CaF2 interface of interest, and at a sapphire window of the same cell. The ratio of the interaction respectively exerted by a sapphire interface and a CaF2 interface is found to be 0.55 0.25, in good agreement with the theoretical evaluation of ~0.67."

In this study we analyse ALMA observations of SiS and CS emission lines for three oxygen-rich galactic AGB stars: IK Tau, with a moderately high mass-loss rate of M yr , and W Hya and R Dor with low mass loss rates of M yr . These molecules are usually more abundant in carbon stars but the high sensitivity of ALMA allows us to detect their faint emission in the low mass-loss rate AGB stars. The high spatial resolution of ALMA also allows us to precisely determine the spatial distribution of these molecules in the circumstellar envelopes. We run radiative transfer models to calculate the molecular abundances and abundance distributions for each star. We find a spread of peak SiS abundances with for R Dor, for W Hya, and for IK Tau relative to H . We find lower peak CS abundances of for R Dor, for W Hya and for IK Tau, with some stratifications in the abundance distributions. For IK Tau we also calculate abundances for the detected isotopologues: C S, SiS, SiS, Si S, Si S, Si S, and Si S.

    "title": "First direct detection of a polarized companion outside of a resolved circumbinary disk around CS Cha",
    "summary": "In the present study we aim to investigate the circumstellar environment of the spectroscopic binary T Tauri star CS Cha. From unresolved mid- to far-infrared photometry it is predicted that CS Cha hosts a disk with a large cavity. In addition, SED modeling suggests significant dust settling, pointing towards an evolved disk that may show signs of ongoing or completed planet formation. We observed CS Cha with the high contrast imager VLT/SPHERE in polarimetric differential imaging mode to resolve the circumbinary disk in near infrared scattered light. These observations were followed-up by VLT/NACO L-band observations and complemented by archival VLT/NACO K-band and HST/WFPC2 I-band data. We resolve the compact circumbinary disk around CS Cha for the first time in scattered light. We find a smooth, low inclination disk with an outer radius of 55 au (at 165 pc). We do not detect the inner cavity but find an upper limit for the cavity size of 15 au. Furthermore, we find a faint co-moving companion with a projected separation of 210 au from the central binary outside of the circumbinary disk. The companion is detected in polarized light and shows an extreme degree of polarization (13.7 0.4 \\% in J-band). The companion's J- and H-band magnitudes are compatible with masses of a few M . However, K-, L- and I-band data draw this conclusion into question. We explore with radiative transfer modeling whether an unresolved circum-companion disk can be responsible for the high polarization and complex photometry. We find that the set of observations is best explained by a heavily extincted low mass ( ) brown dwarf or high mass planet with an unresolved disk and dust envelope."

    "summary": "We have mapped over 50 massive, dense clumps with four dense gas tracers: HCN J=1-0 and 3-2; and CS J=2-1 and 7-6 transitions. Spectral lines of optically thin H^ 13 CN 3-2 and C^ 34 S 5-4 were also obtained towards the map centers. These maps usually demonstrate single well-peaked distributions at our resolution, even with higher J transitions. The size, virial mass, surface density, and mean volume density within a well-defined angular size (FWHM) were calculated from the contour maps for each transition. We found that transitions with higher effective density usually trace the more compact, inner part of the clumps but have larger linewidths, leading to an inverse linewidth-size relation using different tracers. The mean surface densities are 0.29, 0.33, 0.78, 1.09 g cm^ -2 within FWHM contours of CS 2-1, HCN 1-0, HCN 3-2 and CS 7-6, respectively. We find no correlation of L_ IR with surface density and a possible inverse correlation with mean volume density, contrary to some theoretical expectations. We see no evidence in the data for the relation between L'_ mol and mean density posited by modelers. The correlation between L'_ mol and the virial mass is roughly linear for each dense gas tracer. A nearly linear correlation was found between the infrared luminosity and the line luminosity of all dense gas tracers for these massive, dense clumps, with a lower cutoff in luminosity at L_ IR =10^ 4.5 Lsun. The L_ IR -L'_ HCN1-0 correlation agrees well with the one found in galaxies. These correlations indicate a constant star formation rate per unit mass from the scale of dense clumps to that of distant galaxies when the mass is measured for dense gas. These results support the suggestion that starburst galaxies may be understood as having a large fraction of gas in dense clumps."

OCS, O13CS, 13CS, H2S and SO transitions were observed toward a sample of massive star-forming regions with embedded UCH II or CH II regions. These sources could be divided into H II-hot core and H II-only sources based on their CH3CN emission. Our results show that the OCS line of thirteen sources is optically thick, with optical depth ranging from 5 to 16. Column densities of these molecules were computed under LTE conditions. CS column densities were also derived using its optically thin isotopologue 13CS. H2S is likely to be the most abundant gas-phase sulfuretted molecules in hot assive cores. Both the column density and abundance of sulfur-bearing molecules decrease significantly from H II-hot core to H II-only sources. Ages derived from hot core models appear to be consistent with star-formation theories, suggesting that abundance ratios of [CS]/[SO], [SO]/[OCS] and [OCS]/[CS] could be used as chemical clocks in massive star-forming regions."

These multi-object systems can provide information about the formation of low-mass companions in wide orbits and/or help us to speculate about possible migration scenarios. Accurate classification of companions is crucial for testing formation pathways. Aims. In this work we further characterise the recently discovered candidate for a planetary-mass companion CS Cha b and determine if it is still accreting. Methods. MUSE is a four-laser-adaptive-optics-assisted medium-resolution integral-field spectrograph in the optical part of the spectrum. We observed the CS Cha system to obtain the first spectrum of CS Cha b. The companion is characterised by modelling both the spectrum from 6300 to 9300 and the photometry using archival data from the visible to the near-infrared (NIR). Results. We find evidence of accretion and outflow signatures in H and OI emission. The atmospheric models with the highest likelihood indicate an effective temperature of K with a of dex. Based on evolutionary models, we find that the majority of the object is obscured. We determine the mass of the faint companion with several methods to be between 0.07 and 0.71 with an accretion rate of Myr . Conclusions. Our results show that CS Cha B is most likely a mid-M-type star that is obscured by a highly inclined disc, which has led to its previous classification using broadband NIR photometry as a planetary-mass companion. This shows that it is important and necessary to observe over a broad spectral range to constrain the nature of faint companions"

In this letter, we perform a detailed analysis for the established Ti-based compounds and investigate the less-known materials based on Zr. We discuss in details their electronic properties and band symmetries, highlight the similarity between the materials in terms of properties, and reveal limits for tuning electronic and optical properties within this family of vacancy ordered double perovskites that share the same electron configuration. We also show the challenges to compute accurate and meaningful quasi-particle corrections at GW level. Furthermore, we address their chemical stability against different decomposition reaction pathways, identifying stable regions for the formation of all materials, while probing their mechanical stability employing phonon calculations.

A fractional uncertainty about 10-15 level to the clock frequency has been predicted by carrying out rigorous calculations of several atomic properties. The bad-cavity operational mode of the active clock is anticipated to improve its short-term stability remarkably by suppressing intrinsic thermal fluctuations. Thus, a composite clock system with better in both short-term and long-term stabilities can be built by combining the above proposed active clock with another high-accuracy passive optical clock."

    "title": "Mini-batch Coresets for Memory-efficient Language Model Training on Data Mixtures",
    "summary": "Training with larger mini-batches improves the convergence rate and can yield superior performance. However, training with large mini-batches becomes prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs), due to the large GPU memory requirement. To address this problem, an effective approach is finding small mini-batch coresets that closely match the gradient of larger mini-batches. However, this approach becomes infeasible and ineffective for LLMs, due to the highly imbalanced mixture of sources in language data, use of the Adam optimizer, and the very large gradient dimensionality of LLMs. In this work, we address the above challenges by proposing Coresets for Training LLMs (CoLM). First, we show that mini-batch coresets found by gradient matching do not contain representative examples of the small sources w.h.p., and thus including all examples of the small sources in the mini-batch coresets is crucial for optimal performance. Second, we normalize the gradients by their historical exponential to find mini-batch coresets for training with Adam. Finally, we leverage zeroth-order methods to find smooth gradient of the last V-projection matrix and sparsify it to keep the dimensions with the largest normalized gradient magnitude. We apply CoLM to fine-tuning Phi-2, Phi-3, Zephyr, and Llama-3 models with LoRA on MathInstruct and SuperGLUE benchmark. Remarkably, CoLM reduces the memory requirement of fine-tuning by 2x and even outperforms training with 4x larger mini-batches. Moreover, CoLM seamlessly integrates with existing memory-efficient training methods like LoRA, further reducing the memory requirements of training LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/BigML-CS-UCLA/CoLM."

We provide a systematic way to generate these dualities, derived by combining toric duality for N=2 CS-matter theories and generalized non-holomorphic orientifold projections to N=1.

For the lower states of these atoms we have also calculated energies, E1 transition amplitudes, and lifetimes. We have shown that PNC E1 transition amplitudes between s-d states can be calculated to high accuracy. Contrary to the Cs 6s-7s transition, in these transitions there are no strong cancelations between different terms in the sum-over-states approach. In fact, there is one dominating term which deviates from the sum by less than 20%. This term corresponds to an s-p_ 1/2 weak matrix element, which can be calculated to better than 1%, and a p_ 1/2 -d_ 3/2 E1 transition amplitude, which can be measured. Also, the s-d amplitudes are about four times larger than the corresponding s-s transitions.

Despite its popularity, a short operational lifetime is the main drawback of this material. Recent works have shown that the lifetime can be improved by using a robust Cs-Sb-O NEA layer with minimal adverse effects. In this work, we operate GaAs photocathodes with this new activation method in a high voltage environment to extract a high current. We observed spectral dependence on the lifetime improvement.

This work reports an optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) based on the free-induction-decay (FID) protocol, that implements microfabricated cesium (Cs) vapor cell technology to visualize the magnetic field distributions resulting from various magnetic sources placed close to the cell. The slow diffusion of Cs atoms in the presence of a nitrogen (N ) buffer gas enables spatially independent measurements to be made within the same vapor cell by translating a m probe beam over the sensing area. For example, the OPM was used to record temporal and spatial information to reconstruct magnetic field distributions in one and two dimensions. The optimal magnetometer sensitivity was estimated to be 0.43 within a Nyquist limited bandwidth of Hz. Furthermore, the sensor's dynamic range exceeds the Earth's field of approximately T, which provides a framework for magnetic field imaging in unshielded environments."

    "summary": "Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and speeding up its training by 1.2x.

Cs AgBiBr crystallizes in a nominally double-perovskite structure, but exhibits a soft lattice with large atomic fluctuations characteristic of MHPs. While crucial to understand electron-phonon and phonon-phonon couplings, the spatio-temporal correlations of these fluctuations remain largely unknown. Here, we reveal these correlations using comprehensive neutron and x-ray scattering measurements on Cs AgBiBr single-crystals, complemented with first-principles simulations augmented with machine-learned neural-network potentials. We report the discovery of an unexpected complex modulated ground state structure containing several hundred atoms, arising from a soft-phonon instability of the low-temperature tetragonal phase. Further, our experiments and simulations both reveal extensive correlated 2D fluctuations of Br octahedra at finite temperature, arising from soft anharmonic optic phonons, reflecting very shallow potential wells. These results provide new insights into the atomic structure and fluctuations in MHPs, critical to understand and control their thermal and optoelectronic properties."

    "summary": "In the previous decade, there has been a significant advancement in the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), characterized by a notable increase in efficiency from 3.8% to 25%. Nonetheless, PSCs face many problems when we commercialize them because of their toxicity and stability. Consequently, lead-PSCs need an alternative solar cell with high performance and low processing cost; lead-free inorganic perovskites have been explored. Recent research showcased Cs CuBiCl , a lead-free inorganic double perovskite material with remarkable photoelectric characteristics and exceptional environmental robustness. To investigate the potential of Cs CuBiCl material, the solar cell structure FTO/ETL/Cs CuBiCl /HTL/Au was used and analyzed through a solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS-1D). CeO is used as the Electron transport layer (ETL), and CuI is the Hole transport layer (HTL). Furthermore, the research examined the optimization of different parameters of the absorber layer (AL), such as thickness, defect density, electron affinity, band gap, and operational temperature. In the end, it has been noticed that by setting the temperature at 300 K and an electron affinity of 4.3 eV of the absorber layer, the PSCs achieve the highest efficiency of 24.51 %, FF of 43.01 %, Voc of 1.73V, and Jsc of 32.82mA/cm . This is the highest Cs CuBiCl double PSCs efficiency we've reached yet. In theoretical studies, 17.03% of PCE was achieved using Cs CuBiCl as an active layer. The analysis underscores the significant potential of Cs CuBiCl as an absorbing layer in developing highly efficient lead-free all-inorganic PSCs."

Accurate three dimensional ab initio potential energy surfaces have been computed for the ground state and low-lying excited states of H+ - CS system using internally contracted MRCI method and aug-cc-pVQZ basis sets. Rotational excitation and deexcitation integral cross sections are computed at low and ultra low collision energies, respectively.

Among all the transitions, Deltaj=+1 and Deltaj=-1 are found to be predominant for excitation and deexcitation, respectively. Deexcitation cross section in the ultracold region is found to obey Wigner's threshold law. The magnitude of state-to-state excitation rate obtained is maximum for j'=1 in the temperature range 2-240 K while minimum for deexcitation in ultracold region. The rotational excitation cross-section obtained using vibrationally averaged potential show rotational rainbow maximum for j'=2 state.

A classical result of Tutte(1954) is the polynomial time algorithm to check whether a given graph has a specified f-factor. However, checking for the presence of a connected f-factor is easily seen to generalize HAMILTONIAN CYCLE and hence is NP-complete.

Additionally, we evaluated the transport properties using the Boltzmann transport equations. The results indicate that Cs TlBi exhibit high electrical conductivity, reaching S/m, and high electron mobility of 120 cm V.s.

On the other hand, the weak one-eta-exchange and weakly energy-dependent two-kaon-exchange contributions are less important in dynamically generating the state, indicating that chiral EFT is less predictive in the present situation. Furthermore, we apply the Bayesian method to estimate chiral truncation uncertainties and find that they are of similar magnitude as their statistical counterparts.

Using spectroscopic data and accurate quantum chemistry calculations for Cs potential curves and transition dipole moments, we show that this process has a high rate and competes favorably with the single-photon decay back to the lowest triplet state.

But we can not calculate the EDM of an atom using Boltzmann constant. The mechanism of polar atoms by which orientation polarization arises completely differs from polar molecules. The orientation polarization of polar molecule, such as HCl or H2O etc, is a molecule as a whole turned toward the direction of an external field. Unlike polar molecules, the orientation polarization of polar atom, such as K, Rb or Cs atom, is only the valence electron in the outermost shell, along a highly elliptical orbit, turned toward the direction of the field, but the rest of the atom does not move! The article derived the new form of Boltzmann constant. When it was applied to orientation polarization of polar atoms, its value k is far less than 1.38*10-23 J/K(for example, k=7.14*10-29 J/K for Cs atom) . When it was applied to any molecule, non-polar atom or translation and vibration of polar atom, its value k=1.38*10-23J/K.

The scalar, vector, and tensor components of are estimated by expressing as sum of valence, core, core-core, core-valence, and valence-core contributions that are arising from the virtual and core intermediate states. The dominant valence contributions are estimated by combining a large number of matrix elements of the E1 and magnetic dipole hyperfine interaction operators from the relativistic coupled-cluster method and measurements. For an insightful understanding of their accurate determination, we explicitly give intermediate contributions in different forms to the above quantities. Very good agreement of the static values for the scalar and tensor components with their experimental results suggest that our estimated dynamic values can be used reliably to estimate the Stark shifts while conducting high-precision measurements at the respective laser frequency using the clock states of Cs."

Quantitative results for Li - Cs are presented and compared to previously measured Li - Cs Feshbach resonances (FRs) [M. Repp et al., Phys. Rev. A 87 010701(R) (2013)]. We demonstrate how the accuracy of the ABM can be stepwise improved by including magnetic dipole-dipole interactions and coupling to a non-dominant virtual state. We present a MQDT calculation, where magnetic dipole-dipole and second order spin-orbit interactions are included. A frame transformation formalism is introduced, which allows the assignment of measured FRs with only three parameters. All three models achieve a total rms error of < 1G on the observed FRs. We critically compare the different models in view of the accuracy for the description of FRs and the required input parameters for the calculations."

The shift and broadening of the D1 and D2 absorption lines are quite well reproduced by theory, suggesting that the DFT may be useful for describing spectral perturbations in more complex environments."

We demonstrate the apparatus' capabilities by producing Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) of 39K and 133Cs in a manner that will eventually allow sequential condensation within one experimental cycle, precise sample overlap, and magnetic association of atoms into KCs molecules. The condensates are created independently without relying on sympathetic cooling. Our approach is universal and applicable to other species combinations when the two species show dramatically different behavior in terms of loss mechanisms and post laser cooling temperatures, i.e. species combinations that make parallel generation of quantum degenerate samples challenging. We give an outlook over the next experiments involving e.g. sample mixing, molecule formation, and transport into a science chamber for high-resolution spatial imaging of novel quantum-many body phases based on K-Cs."

Thermal emission of large grains or pebbles can be best observed at cm wavelengths. However, other emission mechanisms can contribute. We aim to determine the mechanisms of cm emission for 3 T Tauri stars. WW Cha and RU Lup were recently found to have grain growth at least up to mm sizes in their circumstellar disks. CS Cha has similar indications for grain growth in its circumbinary disk. The T Tauri stars WW Cha and RU Lup were monitored over several years at mm and cm wavelengths, using ATCA. The new ATCA 7 mm system was also used to observe CS Cha. WW Cha was detected on several occasions at 7 and 16 mm. We obtained one detection of WW Cha at 3 cm and upper limits only at 6 cm. The emission at 16 mm was stable over days, months and years, but the emission at 3 cm is found to be variable. RU Lup was detected at 7 mm. It was observed at 16 mm 3 times and at 3 and 6 cm 4 times and found to be variable in all 3 wavebands. CS Cha was detected at 7 mm, but the S/N was too low to resolve the gap in the circumbinary disk. The emission at 3, 7 and 16 mm for WW Cha is well explained by thermal emission from mm and cm-sized pebbles. The cm spectral index is consistent with the emission from an optically-thick ionised wind, but the high variability of the cm emission points to a non-thermal contribution. The SEDs of RU Lup and CS Cha from 1 to 7 mm are consistent with thermal emission from mm-sized grains. The variability of the longer-wavelength emission for RU Lup and the negative spectral index suggest non-thermal emission."

Values of resonance strength of 8 mG and rate coefficients for atom-molecule deactivation of cm s and molecule-molecule one of cm s are estimated by a fit of the theoretical results to the experimental data. Near the resonance, where the highest conversion efficiency was observed, the results demonstrate strong sensitivity to the magnetic field ripple and inhomogeneity.

The key actors are the alternation of single-ion planar anisotropy direction of the individual magnetic Co ions, and their arrangement in a distorted triangular lattice structure. In particular, the uniquely oriented Ising-type anisotropy emerges from the competition of easy-plane ones, and for a magnetic field applied along this axis one finds a cascade of five ordered phases at low temperatures. Two of these phases feature magnetization plateaux. The low-field one is supposed to be a consequence of a collinear ground state stabilized by the anisotropy, while the other plateau bears characteristics of an \"up-up-down\" state exclusive for lattices with triangular exchange patterns. Such coexistence of the magnetization plateaux is a fingerprint of competition between the anisotropy and the geometric frustration in Cs CoBr ."

The CS peak position was observed in C34S J=5-4 towards 57 cores and in 13CS J=5-4 towards the 9 brightest cores. The sample is a subset of a sample originally selected toward water masers; the selection on maser sources should favor sources in an early stage of evolution. The integrated intensity of CS J=5-4 correlates very well with the dust continuum emission at 350 microns. The distributions of size, virial mass, surface density, and luminosity are all peaked with a few cores skewed towards much larger values than the mean. We find a weak correlation between C34S linewidth and size, consistent with Dv ~ R^ 0.3 . The linewidths are much higher than would be predicted by the usual relations between linewidth and size determined from regions of lower mass. These regions are very turbulent. The derived virial mass agrees within a factor of 2 to 3 with mass estimates from dust emission at 350 microns after corrections for the density structure are accounted for. The resulting cumulative mass spectrum of cores above 1000 solar masses can be approximated by a power law with a slope of about -0.9, steeper than that of clouds measured with tracers of lower density gas and close to that for the total masses of stars in OB associations. The median turbulent pressures are comparable to those in UCHII regions, and the pressures at small radii are similar to those in hypercompact-HII regions (P/k ~ 10^ 10 K cm^ -3 ). The filling factors for dense gas are substantial, and the median abundance of CS is about 10^ -9 . The ratio of bolometric luminosity to virial mass is much higher than the value found for molecular clouds as a whole, and the correlation of luminosity with mass is tighter. (Abridged)."

The method avoids the calculation of intermediate atomic states entirely and requires only the wavefunctions of the electronic states involved in the respective hyperfine levels. These wavefunctions are obtained through relativistic general-excitation-rank configuration interaction theory. A variant of the method also enables for calculations on atoms with the most complicated of shell structures. Applications to Rb, Cs and a specific clock transition in Tm are presented. The final results [ Hz/((V/m) )] and [ Hz/((V/m) )] obtained under inclusion of up to quintuple excitations in the atomic wavefunction expansion are compatible with previous calculations and, in the case of Cs, confirm that one of the earlier experimental measurements is not reliable. For Tm that is used in the development of atomic clocks the differential static scalar electric dipole polarizability between ground levels and is calculated to be a.u.

In many applications, particularly those in visual tracking, the unknown state can be split into a small dimensional part, e.g. global motion, and a spatial signal, e.g. illumination or shape deformation. The spatial signal is often well modeled as being sparse in some domain. For a long sequence, its sparsity pattern can change over time, although the changes are usually slow. To address the above problem, we propose a novel solution approach called Particle Filtered Modified-CS (PaFiMoCS). The key idea of PaFiMoCS is to importance sample for the small dimensional state vector, while replacing importance sampling by slow sparsity pattern change constrained posterior mode tracking for recovering the sparse spatial signal. We show that the problem of tracking moving objects across spatially varying illumination change is an example of the above problem and explain how to design PaFiMoCS for it. Experiments on both simulated data as well as on real videos with significant illumination changes demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm as compared with existing particle filter based tracking algorithms."

We propose a two level hierarchical deep learning architecture inspired by divide & conquer principle that decomposes the large scale recognition architecture into root & leaf level model architectures. Each of the root & leaf level models is trained exclusively to provide superior results than possible by any 1-level deep learning architecture prevalent today. The proposed architecture classifies objects in two steps. In the first step the root level model classifies the object in a high level category. In the second step, the leaf level recognition model for the recognized high level category is selected among all the leaf models. This leaf level model is presented with the same input object image which classifies it in a specific category. Also we propose a blend of leaf level models trained with either supervised or unsupervised learning approaches. Unsupervised learning is suitable whenever labelled data is scarce for the specific leaf level models. Currently the training of leaf level models is in progress; where we have trained 25 out of the total 47 leaf level models as of now.

We investigate anti-Stokes PL from green-luminescent Cs PbBr , whose origin is attributable to CsPbBr3 nanostructures embedded in a Cs PbBr crystal. Because of the high transparency, low refractive index, and high stability of Cs PbBr , the green PL displays high external quantum efficiency without photo-degradation. Time-resolved PL spectroscopy reveals the excitonic behaviors in recombination process. The shape of the PL spectrum is almost independent of excitation photon energy, which means that the spectral width is determined by homogeneous broadening. We demonstrate that the phonon-assisted process dominates the Urbach tail of optical absorption and anti-Stokes PL at room temperature. Anti-Stokes PL is observed down to 70 K. We determine the temperature dependence of the Urbach energy and estimate the strength of the electron-phonon coupling.

We show that the newly observed state is the -spin partner of as a resonance within coupled-channel calculation in the symmetry and heavy quark spin symmetry (HQSS). In the symmetry, we introduce the parity to construct the flavor wave functions of the states. In a unified framework, we consider the , coupled-channel effect with the contact interaction. With the masses and widths of and , we determine all the unknown coupling constants. We obtain mass and width of in good agreement with the experimental results, which strongly supports the states as the -spin partner states of the charged .

    "title": "Emergent Kondo scaling in iron-based superconductors AFe2As2 (A = K, Rb, Cs)",
    "summary": "Unconventional superconductivity from heavy fermion (HF) is always observed in f-electron systems, in which Kondo physics between localized f-electrons and itinerant electrons plays an essential role. Whether HF superconductivity could be achieved in other systems without f electrons, especially for d-electron systems, is still elusive. Here, we experimentally study the origin of d-electron HF behavior in iron-based superconductors (FeSCs) AFe2As2 (A = K, Rb, Cs). Nuclear magnetic resonance on 75As reveals a universal coherent-incoherent crossover with a characteristic temperature T*. Below T*, a so-called 'Knight shift anomaly' is first observed in FeSCs, which exhibits a scaling behavior similar to f-electron HF materials. Furthermore, the scaling rule also regulates the manifestation of magnetic fluctuation. These results undoubtedly support an emergent Kondo scenario for the d-electron HF behavior, which suggests the AFe2As2 (A = K, Rb, Cs) as the first material realization of d-electron HF superconductors."

    "summary": "On October 14, 2015, Tesla Inc. an American electric car company, released the initial version of the Autopilot system. This system promised to provide semi-autonomous driving using the existing hardware already installed on Tesla vehicles. On March 23rd, 2018, a Tesla vehicle ran into a divider at highway speed, killing the driver. This occurred under the control of the Autopilot system with no driver intervention. Critics argue that though Tesla gives drivers warnings in its owner's manual, it is ultimately unethical to release a system that is marketed as an Autopilot yet still makes grave mistakes that any human driver would not make. Others defend Tesla by stating that their advisories are suitable and that drivers should ultimately be at fault for any mistakes of the Autopilot. This paper will scrutinize the ethical implications of Tesla's choice to develop, market, and ship a beta product that requires extensive testing. It will further analyze the implications of Tesla's aggressive advertisement of the product under the name Autopilot along with associated marketing materials. By applying the joint ACM/IEEE-CS Software Engineering Code of Ethics, this paper will show that Tesla's choices and actions during this event are inconsistent with the code and are unethical since they are responsible for adequately testing and honestly marketing their product."

    "summary": "Dataset distillation (DD) generates small synthetic datasets that can efficiently train deep networks with a limited amount of memory and compute. Despite the success of DD methods for supervised learning, DD for self-supervised pre-training of deep models has remained unaddressed. Pre-training on unlabeled data is crucial for efficiently generalizing to downstream tasks with limited labeled data. In this work, we propose the first effective DD method for SSL pre-training. First, we show, theoretically and empirically, that naive application of supervised DD methods to SSL fails, due to the high variance of the SSL gradient. Then, we address this issue by relying on insights from knowledge distillation (KD) literature. Specifically, we train a small student model to match the representations of a larger teacher model trained with SSL. Then, we generate a small synthetic dataset by matching the training trajectories of the student models. As the KD objective has considerably lower variance than SSL, our approach can generate synthetic datasets that can successfully pre-train high-quality encoders. Through extensive experiments, we show that our distilled sets lead to up to 13% higher accuracy than prior work, on a variety of downstream tasks, in the presence of limited labeled data.

We implemented 3D Cartesian k-space prospective undersampling with a variable number of averages for each k-line. The performance of this compressed sensing with variable-density averaging (CS-VDA) method was evaluated in retrospective analysis of fully sampled phantom MRI measurements, as well as for prospectively accelerated in vivo 3D brain and knee MRI scans. Both phantom and in vivo results showed that acquisitions using the CS-VDA approach resulted in better image quality as compared to full sampling of k-space in the same scan time. Specifically, CS-VDA with a higher number of averages in the center of k-space resulted in the best image quality, apparent from increased anatomical detail with preserved soft-tissue contrast. This novel approach will facilitate improved image quality of inherently low SNR data, such as those with high-resolution or specific contrast-weightings with low SNR efficiency."

Mapping out the magnetic phase diagram reveals an unusual continuous spin-flop-like phase transition associated with a quantum critical point within the antiferromagnetically ordered phase. A quantitative analysis of the complex magnetic excitation spectrum measured in zero field allows us to derive a model magnetic Hamiltonian for this compound.

L1551 NE is categorized as a class 0 object deeply embedded in the red-shifted outflow lobe of L1551 IRS 5. Previous studies of the L1551 NE region in CS emission revealed the presence of shell-like components open toward L1551 IRS 5, which seem to trace low-velocity shocks in the swept-up shell driven by the outflow from L1551 IRS 5. In this study, significant CS emission around L1551 NE was detected at the eastern tip of the swept-up shell from = 5.3 km s to 10.1 km s , and the total mass of the dense gas is estimated to be 0.18 0.02 . Additionally, the following new structures were successfully revealed: a compact disklike component with a size of 1000 AU just at L1551 NE, an arc-shaped structure around L1551 NE, open toward L1551 NE, with a size of AU, i.e., a bow shock, and a distinct velocity gradient of the dense gas, i.e., deceleration along the outflow axis of L1551 IRS 5. These features suggest that the CS emission traces the post-shocked region where the dense gas associated with L1551 NE and the swept-up shell of the outflow from L1551 IRS 5 interact. Since the age of L1551 NE is comparable to the timescale of the interaction, it is plausible that the formation of L1551 NE was induced by the outflow impact. The compact structure of L1551 NE with a tiny envelope was also revealed, suggesting that the outer envelope of L1551 NE has been blown off by the outflow from L1551 IRS 5."

This type of photocathode requires a thin surface layer, in order to achieve negative electron affinity (NEA) for efficient photo-emission.

Here, we first experimentally measure such its thermal transport behavior from 20~K to 300~K, after synthesizing Cs Bi I Cl single crystals. Using path-integral molecular dynamics simulations driven by machine learning potentials, we reveal that Cs Bi I Cl has large lattice distortions at low temperatures, which may be related to the large atomic size mismatch. Employing the Wigner formulation of thermal transport, we reproduce the experimental thermal conductivities based on lattice-distorted structures. This study thus provides a framework for predicting and understanding glassy thermal transport in materials with strong lattice disorder."

The different Cs induced changes of the As 3d and Ga 3d core level spectra show that charge transfer is almost complete for Ga surface sites, but is negligible to surface As at a coverage smaller than 0.3 ML. The situation is opposite for a coverage larger than 0.3ML, at which transfer occurs to As but no longer to Ga. Charge transfer to As atoms leads to disordering and destabilization and induces surface conversion from the As-rich surface to the Ga-rich 4x2 one after annealing at a reduced temperature of 450 C."

Moreover, we derive a data-driven APV+COHERENT measurement of the low-energy weak mixing angle with a percent uncertainty, independent of the value of the average neutron rms radius of and , that is allowed to vary freely in the fit. Additionally, we extensively discuss the impact of using two different determinations of the theoretical parity non-conserving amplitude in the APV fit. Our findings show that the particular choice can make a significant difference, up to 6.5% on (Cs) and 11% on the weak mixing angle. Finally, in light of the recent announcement of a future deployment of a 10 kg and a 700 kg cryogenic CsI detectors, we provide future prospects for these measurements, comparing them with other competitive experiments that are foreseen in the near future."

We describe details of the Cs sensors' construction and modes of operation, emphasizing the accuracy and sensitivity of the magnetic field readout. We present two applications of the magnetometer array directly beneficial to the nEDM experiment: (i) the implementation of a strategy to correct for the drift of the vertical magnetic field gradient and (ii) a procedure to homogenize the magnetic field. The first reduces the uncertainty of the new nEDM result. The second enables transverse neutron spin relaxation times exceeding 1500 s, improving the statistical sensitivity of the nEDM experiment by about 35% and effectively increasing the rate of nEDM data taking by a factor of 1.8."

Here we report a systematic ARPES study of Cs(V1-xNbx)3Sb5 as a function of Nb content x, where isovalent Nb substitution causes an enhancement of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) and the reduction of CDW temperature (TCDW). We found that the Nb substitution shifts the Sb-derived electron band at the Gamma point downward and simultaneously moves the V-derived band around the M point upward to lift up the saddle point (SP) away from the Fermi level, leading to the reduction of CDW-gap magnitude and TCDW. This indicates a primary role of the SP density of states to stabilize CDW. The present result also suggests that the enhancement of superconductivity by Nb substitution is caused by the cooperation between the expansion of the Sb-derived electron pocket and the recovery of the V-derived density of states at the Fermi level."

The dangling spins couple with one another via effective exchange interactions, which are mediated by chain spins. The dangling spins are further divided into two subsystems, DS1 and DS2. The dangling spins in DS1 undergo three-dimensional ferromagnetic ordering at 3.14 K, while those in DS2 remain paramagnetic down to 0.35 K. The effective interaction between the DS1 spins is approximately expressed by the ferromagnetic model with the direction parallel to the crystallographic c axis.

Molecular resonances were observed that correspond to excitation of Rydberg-atom-pair states correlated not only to the p p dissociation asymptotes, but also to s s , s f , and f f dissociation asymptotes. These pair resonances are interpreted as arising from dipole-dipole, and higher-order long-range-interaction terms between the Rydberg atoms on the basis of i) their spectral positions, ii) their response to static and pulsed electric fields, and iii) millimeter-wave spectra between pair states correlated to different pair-dissociation asymptotes. The Rydberg-atom--pair states were found to spontaneously decay by Penning ionization and the dynamics of the ionization process were investigated during the first 10 s following initial photoexcitation. To interpret the experimental observations, a potential model was derived that is based on the numerical determination of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the long-range interaction Hamiltonian. With this potential model, which does not include adjustable parameters, all experimental observations could be accounted for, and the results demonstrate that long-range-interaction models provide a global and accurate description of interactions in ultracold Rydberg gases and that they correctly account for, and enable the analysis of, phenomena as diverse as the formation of Rydberg macrodimers, Penning ionization in dense Rydberg gases, and Rydberg-excitation blockade effects."

However, conventionally grown alkali antimonide films are polycrystalline with surface disorder and roughness that can limit achievable beam brightness. Ordering the crystalline structure of alkali antimonides has the potential to deliver higher brightness electron beams by reducing surface disorder and enabling the engineering of material properties at the level of atomic layers. In this report, we demonstrate the growth of ordered Cs Sb films on single crystal substrates 3C-SiC and graphene-coated 4H-SiC using pulsed laser deposition and conventional thermal evaporation growth techniques. The crystalline structures of the Cs Sb films were examined using reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) diagnostics, while film thickness and roughness estimates were made using x-ray reflectivity (XRR). With these tools, we observed ordered domains in less than 10 nm thick films with quantum efficiencies greater than one percent at 530 nm. Moreover, we identify structural features such as Laue oscillations indicative of highly ordered films. We found that Cs Sb films grew with flat, fiber-textured surfaces on 3C-SiC and with multiple ordered domains and sub-nanometer surface roughness on graphene-coated 4H-SiC under our growth conditions. We identify the crystallographic orientations of Cs Sb grown on graphene-coated 4H-SiC substrates and discuss the significance of examining the crystal structure of these films for growing epitaxial heterostructures in future experiments."

This leads to *poor worst-group test accuracy*, i.e., poor accuracy for minority groups that lack these spurious features. Despite the growing body of recent efforts to address spurious correlations (SC), several challenging settings remain unexplored.In this work, we propose studying methods to mitigate SC in settings with: 1) spurious features that are learned more slowly, 2) a larger number of classes, and 3) a larger number of groups. We introduce two new datasets, Animals and SUN, to facilitate this study and conduct a systematic benchmarking of 8 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across a total of 5 vision datasets, training over 5,000 models. Through this, we highlight how existing group inference methods struggle in the presence of spurious features that are learned later in training. Additionally, we demonstrate how all existing methods struggle in settings with more groups and/or classes. Finally, we show the importance of careful model selection (hyperparameter tuning) in extracting optimal performance, especially in the more challenging settings we introduced, and propose more cost-efficient strategies for model selection. Overall, through extensive and systematic experiments, this work uncovers a suite of new challenges and opportunities for improving worst-group generalization in the presence of spurious features.

    "summary": "Experimental measurements of photoionization rates of Rydberg states of Cs ( ) in a 1064 nm far off-resonance dipole trap are presented. The photoionization rates are obtained by measuring the lifetimes of Rydberg atoms produced inside of a 1064 nm far off-resonance trap and comparing the lifetimes to corresponding control experiments in a magneto-optical trap. Experimental results for the control experiments agree with recent theoretical predictions for Rydberg state lifetimes and measured photoionization rates are in agreement with transition rates calculated from a model potential."

    "summary": "The SPIDER experiment, operated at the Neutral Beam Test Facility of Consorzio RFX, Padua, hosts the prototype of the H-/D- ion source for the ITER neutral beam injectors. The maximization of the ion current extracted from the source and the minimization of the amount of co-extracted electrons are among the most relevant targets to accomplish. The Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy diagnostic measures the negative ion density in the source close to the plasma grid (the plasma-facing grid of the ion acceleration system), so to identify the source operational parameters that maximize the amount of negative ions which can be extracted. In this study SPIDER was operated in hydrogen and deuterium in Cs-free conditions, therefore negative ions were mostly produced by reactions in the plasma volume. This work shows how the magnetic filter field and the bias currents, present in SPIDER to limit the amount of co-extracted electrons, affect the density of negative ions available for extraction. The results indicate that the magnetic filter field in front of the acceleration system should be set between about 1.6 mT, condition that maximizes the density of available negative ions, and about 3.2 mT, condition that minimizes the ratio of electron current to ion current. The negative ion density also resulted to be maximized when the plasma grid and its surrounding bias plate was positively biased against the source body with a total current in the range 0 A÷100 A. The paper shows also how much, in Cs-free conditions, the electric fields in the acceleration system can affect the density of negative ions in the source, close to the plasma grid apertures."

    "summary": "Dominated by a single, large-amplitude pulsation mode, the rapidly-pulsating hot subdwarf B star CS 1246 is a prime candidate for a long-term O-C diagram study. We collected nearly 400 hours of photometry with the PROMPT telescopes over a time span of 14 months to begin looking for secular variations in the pulse timings. Interestingly, the O-C diagram is dominated by a strong sinusoidal pattern with a period of 14.1 days and an amplitude of 10.7 light-seconds. Underneath this sine wave is a secular trend implying a decrease in the 371.7-s pulsational period of Pdot = -1.9 x 10^-11, which we attribute to the evolution of the star through the H-R diagram. The sinusoidal variation could be produced by the presence of a low-mass companion, with m sin i ~ 0.12 Msun, orbiting the subdwarf B star at a distance of 20 Rsun. An analysis of the combined light curve reveals the presence of a low-amplitude first harmonic to the main pulsation mode."

    "summary": "We address the problem of reconstructing high quality images from undersampled MRI data. This is a challenging task due to the highly ill-posed nature of the problem. In particular, in dynamic MRI scans, the interaction between the target structure and the physical motion affects the acquired measurements leading to blurring artefacts and loss of fine details. In this work, we propose a framework for dynamic MRI reconstruction framed under a new multi-task optimisation model called Compressed Sensing Plus Motion (CS+M). Firstly, we propose a single optimisation problem that simultaneously computes the MRI reconstruction and the physical motion. Secondly, we show our model can be efficiently solved by breaking it up into two more computationally tractable problems. The potentials and generalisation capabilities of our approach are demonstrated in different clinical applications including cardiac cine, cardiac perfusion and brain perfusion imaging. We show, through numerical and graphical experiments, that the proposed scheme reduces blurring artefacts and preserves the target shape and fine details. We also report the highest quality reconstruction under highly undersampling rates in comparison to several state of the art techniques."

    "summary": "We present an overview of our recent investigations of long-range interactions in an ultracold Cs Rydberg gas. These interactions are studied by high-resolution photoassociation spectroscopy, using excitation close to one-photon transitions into p Rydberg states with pulsed and continuous-wave ultraviolet laser radiation, and lead to the formation of long-range Cs molecules. We observe two types of molecular resonances. The first type originates from the correlated excitation of two atoms into Rydberg-atom-pair states interacting at long range via multipole-multipole interactions. The second type results from the interaction of one atom excited to a Rydberg state with one atom in the electronic ground state. Which type of resonances is observed in the experiments depends on the laser intensity and frequency and on the pulse sequences used to prepare the Rydberg states. We obtain insights into both types of molecular resonances by modelling the interaction potentials, using a multipole expansion of the long-range interaction for the first type of resonances and a Fermi-contact pseudo-potential for the second type of resonances. We analyse the relation of these long-range molecular resonances to molecular Rydberg states and ion-pair states, and discuss their decay channels into atomic and molecular ions. In experiments carried out with a two-colour two-photon excitation scheme, we observe a large enhancement of Rydberg-excitation probability, which we interpret as a saturable autocatalytic antiblockade phenomenon."

We use synchrotron x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, optical band gap and photoluminescence measurements to explore the structural and the optical properties of Cs TeCl under pressure up to 30.0 GPa. We find that Cs TeCl undergoes a structural transition from cubic Fm m to monoclinic P2 /n at very low pressure below 1.0 GPa. A significant increase in photoluminescence intensity and a rapid decrease in optical band gap are observed, which are related to the octahedral distortion and structural transition. Interestingly, with increasing pressure, the sample regains its ambient Fm m structure at around 3.4 GPa maintaining the cubic phase up to 30.0 GPa. The sample undergoes an iso-structural transition at around 14.1 GPa pressure with a slight decrease in compressibility."

    "summary": "We present FCRAO maps as well as combined BIMA and FCRAO maps of the high density molecular emission towards the CS core in the L673 region. With the FCRAO telescope, we mapped the emission in the CS(2-1), C34S(2-1), HCO+(1-0), and H13CO+(1-0) lines. The high density molecular emission, which arises from a filamentary structure oriented in the NW-SE direction, shows clear morphological differences for each molecule. We find that HCO+ has an extremely high optical depth, and that the H13CO+ emission is well correlated with submm sources. The BIMA and FCRAO combined maps recover emission from a lot of other structure which was previously undetected or only marginally detected, and show an overall aspect of a filamentary structure connecting several intense clumps. We found a total 15 clumps in our combined data cube, all of them resolved by our angular resolution, with diameters in the 0.03-0.09 pc range. We find a clear segregation between the northern and southern region of the map: the northern section shows the less chemically evolved gas and less massive but more numerous clumps, while the southern region is dominated by the largest and most massive clump, and contains the more evolved gas, as traced by emission of late-time molecules. We find that the derived clump masses are below the virial mass, and that the clumps masses become closer to the virial mass when they get bigger and more massive. This supports the idea that these clumps must be transient, and only the more massive ones have a chance to last long enough to form stars. The clumps we detect are probably in an earlier evolutionary stage than the ``starless cores'' reported recently in the literature. Only the most massive one has properties similar to a ``starless core''."

    "summary": "Legged robots can have a unique role in manipulating objects in dynamic, human-centric, or otherwise inaccessible environments. Although most legged robotics research to date typically focuses on traversing these challenging environments, many legged platform demonstrations have also included \"moving an object\" as a way of doing tangible work. Legged robots can be designed to manipulate a particular type of object (e.g., a cardboard box, a soccer ball, or a larger piece of furniture), by themselves or collaboratively. The objective of this review is to collect and learn from these examples, to both organize the work done so far in the community and highlight interesting open avenues for future work. This review categorizes existing works into four main manipulation methods: object interactions without grasping, manipulation with walking legs, dedicated non-locomotive arms, and legged teams. Each method has different design and autonomy features, which are illustrated by available examples in the literature. Based on a few simplifying assumptions, we further provide quantitative comparisons for the range of possible relative sizes of the manipulated object with respect to the robot. Taken together, these examples suggest new directions for research in legged robot manipulation, such as multifunctional limbs, terrain modeling, or learning-based control, to support a number of new deployments in challenging indoor/outdoor scenarios in warehouses/construction sites, preserved natural areas, and especially for home robotics."

However, the real-space modulations of altermagnetism are often neglected and have not been explored experimentally. Here we combine neutron diffraction, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), spin-resolved ARPES and density functional theory to demonstrate that Cs V Te O realizes a spatially modulated form of altermagnetism, i.e., hidden altermagnetism. Such a state in Cs V Te O results from its G-type antiferromagnetism and two-dimensional electronic states, allowing for the development of spatially alternating altermagnetic layers, whose local spin polarizations are directly verified by spin-resolved ARPES measurements. Our experimental discovery of hidden altermagnetism broadens the scope of unconventional magnetism and opens routes to exploring emergent phenomena from real-space modulations of altermagnetic order."

The STEREO data that cover five-year time interval between 2007 and 2011 are analyzed by means of the Lomb-Scargle and Phase Dispersion Minimization methods. In order to obtain a reliable rotation period and its error value, computational algorithms such as the Levenberg-Marquardt and Monte-Carlo simulation algorithms are applied to the data sets. Thus, the rotation period of CS\\,Vir is improved to be 9.29572(12) days by using the five-year of combined data set. Also, the light elements are calculated as by means of the extremum times derived from the STEREO light curves and archives. Moreover, with this study, a period variation is revealed for the first time, and it is found that the period has lengthened by 0.66(8) s y , equivalent to 66 seconds per century. Additionally, a time-scale for a possible spin-down is calculated around yr. The differential rotation and magnetic braking are thought to be responsible of the mentioned rotational deceleration. It is deduced that the spin-down time-scale of the star is nearly three orders of magnitude shorter than its main-sequence lifetime ( yr). It is, in return, suggested that the process of increase in the period might be reversible."

    "summary": "With [Fe/H] = -3.5, CS 30322-023 is the most metal-poor star to exhibit a clear s-process signature and the most metal-poor ``lead star'' known. CS 30322-023 is also remarkable in having the lowest surface gravity (log g <= -0.3) among the metal-poor stars studied to date. The available evidence indicates that this star is presently a thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) star, with no strong indication of binarity thus far (although a signal of period 192 d is clearly present in the radial-velocity data, this is likely due to pulsation of the stellar envelope). We show that low-mass TP-AGB stars are not expected to be exceedingly rare in a magnitude-limited sample such as the HK survey, because their high luminosities make it possible to sample them over a very large volume. The strong N overabundance and the low 12C/13C ratio (4) in this star is typical of the operation of the CN cycle. Coupled with a Na overabundance and the absence of a strong C overabundance, this pattern seems to imply that hot-bottom burning operated in this star, which should then have a mass of at least 2 Msun. However, the luminosity associated with this mass would put the star at a distance of about 50 kpc, in the outskirts of the galactic halo. We explore alternative scenarios in which the observed abundance pattern results from some mixing mechanism yet to be identified occurring in a single low-metallicity 0.8 Msun AGB star, or from pollution by matter from an intermediate-mass AGB companion which has undergone hot-bottom burning. We stress, however, that our abundances may be subject to uncertainties due to NLTE or 3D granulation effects which were not taken into consideration."

Using this method we are able to produce up to 24 separate pulses of molecules from a single atomic condensate, with a molecular pulse created every 7.2 ms.

To address the challenges associated with predicting accurate electronic properties in materials containing heavier elements such as cesium, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects have been incorporated into our calculations. The mechanical robustness of both Rb CaH and Cs-doped Rb CaH , as demonstrated by their mechanical properties, highlights these materials as promising candidates due to their stability in hydrogen storage applications. Anisotropic factors show that all materials exhibit anisotropy, suggesting a directional dependency in their properties. The Pugh ratio indicates that Rb CaH and Cs-doped Rb CaH are brittle materials. Based on the calculated band gap, the electronic band structure analysis, conducted using both HSE06 and GGA-PBE, shows that Rb CaH and Cs-doped Rb CaH are wide-bandgap materials. Rb CaH and Cs-doped Rb CaH exhibit the highest optical conductivity, absorption coefficient, and energy loss function among optoelectronic materials, emphasizing their superior absorption and electron transfer capabilities.

However, most perovskite nanocrystals shine at green and red wavelengths, the observation of intense and stable blue emission still being a challenging target. In this work, we report a method to attain intense and enduring blue emission (470-480 nm), with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 40%, originated from very small CsPbBr nanocrystals (diameter<3nm) formed by controllably exposing Cs PbBr to humidity. This process is mediated by the void network of a mesoporous transparent scaffold in which the zero-dimensional (0D) Cs PbBr lattice is embedded, which allows the fine control over water adsorption and condensation that determines the optimization of the synthetic procedure and, eventually, the nanocrystal size. By temperature dependent photoemission analysis of samples with different [CsPbBr ]/[Cs PbBr ] volume ratios, we show that the bright blue emission observed results from the efficient charge transfer to the CsPbBr inclusions from the Cs PbBr host. Our approach provides a means to attain highly efficient transparent blue light emitting films that complete the palette offered by perovskite nanocrystals for lighting and display applications."

Both emission lines are azimuthally asymmetric and are suppressed under the horseshoe-shaped continuum emission peak. A possible mechanism to explain the decrease under the horseshoe-shaped continuum is the increased opacity coming from the higher dust concentration at the continuum peak.

The NUV channel provides usable spectral information in a bandpass covering 2000 - 3400 A with a point source spectral resolving power of approximately 100. The primary spectral features in this range include solar continuum scattered from cometary dust and emissions from OH and CS molecular bands centered near 3085 and 2575 A, respectively. In particular, we report the only cometary CS emission detected during this event. The observations allow the evolution of these spectral features to be tracked over the period of the encounter. In general, the NUV emissions observed from Tempel 1 are much fainter than those that have been observed by GALEX from other comets. However, it is possible to derive production rates for the parent molecules of the species detected by GALEX in Tempel 1 and to determine the number of these molecules liberated by the impact. The derived quiescent production rates are Q(H2O) = 6.4e27 molecules/s and Q(CS2) = 6.7e24 molecules/s, while the impact produced an additional 1.6e32 H2O molecules and 1.3e29 CS2 molecules, a similar ratio as in quiescent outgassing."

    "title": "4D-CS: Exploiting Cluster Prior for 4D Spatio-Temporal LiDAR Semantic Segmentation",
    "summary": "Semantic segmentation of LiDAR points has significant value for autonomous driving and mobile robot systems. Most approaches explore spatio-temporal information of multi-scan to identify the semantic classes and motion states for each point. However, these methods often overlook the segmentation consistency in space and time, which may result in point clouds within the same object being predicted as different categories. To handle this issue, our core idea is to generate cluster labels across multiple frames that can reflect the complete spatial structure and temporal information of objects. These labels serve as explicit guidance for our dual-branch network, 4D-CS, which integrates point-based and cluster-based branches to enable more consistent segmentation. Specifically, in the point-based branch, we leverage historical knowledge to enrich the current feature through temporal fusion on multiple views. In the cluster-based branch, we propose a new strategy to produce cluster labels of foreground objects and apply them to gather point-wise information to derive cluster features. We then merge neighboring clusters across multiple scans to restore missing features due to occlusion. Finally, in the point-cluster fusion stage, we adaptively fuse the information from the two branches to optimize segmentation results. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, and we achieve state-of-the-art results on the multi-scan semantic and moving object segmentation on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets. The code will be available at https://github.com/NEU-REAL/4D-CS.git."

    "title": "\"Dressing\" lines and vertices in calculations of matrix elements with the coupled-cluster method and determination of Cs atomic properties",
    "summary": "We consider evaluation of matrix elements with the coupled-cluster method. Such calculations formally involve infinite number of terms and we devise a method of partial summation (dressing) of the resulting series. Our formalism is built upon an expansion of the product of cluster amplitudes into a sum of -body insertions. We consider two types of insertions: particle/hole line insertion and two-particle/two-hole random-phase-approximation-like insertion. We demonstrate how to ``dress'' these insertions and formulate iterative equations. We illustrate the dressing equations in the case when the cluster operator is truncated at single and double excitations. Using univalent systems as an example, we upgrade coupled-cluster diagrams for matrix elements with the dressed insertions and highlight a relation to pertinent fourth-order diagrams. We illustrate our formalism with relativistic calculations of hyperfine constant and electric-dipole transition amplitude for Cs atom. Finally, we augment the truncated coupled-cluster calculations with otherwise omitted fourth-order diagrams. The resulting analysis for Cs is complete through the fourth-order of many-body perturbation theory and reveals an important role of triple and disconnected quadruple excitations."

    "summary": "We report on low-temperature heat-transport properties of the spin-1/2 triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Cs CuCl . Broad maxima in the thermal conductivity along the three principal axes, observed at about 5 K, are interpreted in terms of the Debye model, including the phonon Umklapp scattering. For thermal transport along the axis, we observed a pronounced field-dependent anomaly, close to the transition into the three-dimensional long-range-ordered state. No such anomalies were found for the transport along the and directions. We argue that this anisotropic behavior is related to an additional heat-transport channel through magnetic excitations, that can best propagate along the direction of the largest exchange interaction. Besides, peculiarities of the heat transport of Cs CuCl in magnetic fields up to the saturation field and above are discussed."

    "summary": "Tuning the energy landscape of manybody electronic states in extended solids through the inductive effect-a concept widely used in organic chemistry-offers a new, effective strategy for materials development. Here, we demonstrate this approach using the ANd(SO4)2 (A = Rb, Cs) model system, which possesses different A-site electronegativity and displays a distorted triangular lattice of Nd3+ (4I9/2 ground term). Magnetization data indicate appreciable antiferromagnetic interactions without long-range ordering down to 1.8 K while highlighting the tunable population of the electronic states. Temperature-dependent and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal that emissions and nonradiative processes can be modified by the inductive effect at the atomic level. Heat capacity data confirm no magnetic ordering and add insight into the role of phonons in emission lifetime. Density functional theory calculations prove enhanced covalency in the Cs compound compared to the Rb counterpart while acknowledging the adjustable magnetic intralayer and inter-layer exchange pathways. These results demonstrate a viable framework for utilizing the inductive effect as an important knob for simultaneously dialing in magnetic, optical, and electronic properties in quantum materials."

    "summary": "We report nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of the spin-1/2 anisotropic triangular lattice antiferromagnet Cs CuCl as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field. The observed temperature and magnetic field dependence of the NMR relaxation rate suggests that low energy excitations in the short-range ordered region stabilized over a wide range of intermediate fields and temperatures of the phase diagram are gapless or nearly gapless fermionic excitations. An upper bound on the size of the gap of 0.037 meV is established. The magnetization and NMR relaxation rate can be qualitatively described either by a quasi-1D picture of weakly coupled chains, or by mean-field theories of specific 2D spin liquids; however, quantitative differences exist between data and theory in both cases. This comparison indicates that 2D interactions are quantitatively important in describing the low-energy physics."

We trace gas within at least four Galactic arms, typically tracing total (atomic+molecular) line-of-sight H column densities of 2-3 10 cm . Assuming standard X-factor values and that most of the HI/CO emission seen towards HESS J1731 347 is on the near-side of the Galaxy, X-ray absorption column densities are consistent with HI+CO-derived column densities foreground to, but not beyond, the Scutum-Crux Galactic arm, suggesting a kinematic distance of 3.2 kpc for HESS J1731 347.

A navigation agent is supposed to have various intelligent skills, such as visual perceiving, mapping, planning, exploring and reasoning, etc. Building such an agent that observes, thinks, and acts is a key to real intelligence. The remarkable learning ability of deep learning methods empowered the agents to accomplish embodied visual navigation tasks. Despite this, embodied visual navigation is still in its infancy since a lot of advanced skills are required, including perceiving partially observed visual input, exploring unseen areas, memorizing and modeling seen scenarios, understanding cross-modal instructions, and adapting to a new environment, etc. Recently, embodied visual navigation has attracted rising attention of the community, and numerous works has been proposed to learn these skills.

Various improvements in the systematic fitting of the experiments have permitted to supersede the major difficulty of a severe overlap of the hyperfine components, originating on the one hand in a relatively small natural structure, and on the other hand on a large pressure broadening imposed by the high atomic density needed for the observation of selective reflection on a weak transition. The strength of the van der Waals surface interaction is evaluated to be 73 10 kHz. m3. An evaluation of the pressure shift of the transition is also provided as a by-product of the measurement. We finally discuss the significance of an apparent disagreement between the experimental measurement of the surface interaction, and the theoretical value calculated for an electromagnetic vacuum at a null temperature. The possible influence of the thermal excitation of the surface is evoked, because, the dominant contributions to the vW interaction for Cs(8P3/2) lie in the far infrared range."

However, various spectroscopic studies report rapid charge carrier mobility loss in the first picosecond after photoexcitation, limiting carrier collection efficiencies. The origin of this rapid mobility loss is still unclear. Here, we directly compare hot excitation with excitation over the indirect fundamental bandgap, using transient absorption and THz spectroscopy on the same Cs AgBiBr thin film sample. From transient absorption spectroscopy, we find that hot carriers cool towards the band-edges with a cooling rate of 0.58 ps , which coincides with the observed mobility loss rate from THz spectroscopy. Hence, our study establishes a direct link between the hot carrier cooling and ultrafast mobility loss on the picosecond timescale."

    "summary": "Teaching applied ethics in computer science has shifted from a perspective of teaching about professional codes of conduct and an emphasis on risk management towards a broader understanding of the impacts of computing on humanity and the environment and the principles and practices of responsible computing. One of the primary shifts in the approach to teaching computing ethics comes from research in the social sciences and humanities. This position is grounded in the idea that all computing artifacts, projects, tools, and products are situated within a set of ideas, attitudes, goals, and cultural norms. This means that all computing endeavors have embedded within them a set of values. To teach responsible computing always requires us to first recognize that computing happens in a context that is shaped by cultural values, including our own professional culture and values. The purpose of this paper is to highlight current scholarship, principles, and practices in the teaching of responsible computing in undergraduate computer science settings. The paper is organized around four primary sections: 1) a high-level rationale for the adoption of different pedagogical approaches based on program context and course learning goals, 2) a brief survey of responsible computing pedagogical approaches; 3) illustrative examples of how topics within the CS 2023 Social, Ethical, and Professional (SEP) knowledge area can be implemented and assessed across the broad spectrum of undergraduate computing courses; and 4) links to examples of current best practices, tools, and resources for faculty to build responsible computing teaching into their specific instructional settings and CS2023 knowledge areas."

    "summary": "There is a sharp disconnect between the programming and mathematical portions of the standard undergraduate computer science curriculum, leading to student misunderstanding about how the two are related. We propose connecting the subjects early in the curriculum---specifically, in CS1 and the introductory discrete mathematics course---by using formal reasoning about programs as a bridge between them. This article reports on Haverford and Grinnell College's experience in constructing the end points of this bridge between CS1 and discrete mathematics. Haverford's long-standing \"3-2-1\" curriculum introduces code reasoning in conjunction with introductory programming concepts, and Grinnell's discrete mathematics introduces code reasoning as a motivation for logic and formal deduction. Both courses present code reasoning in a style based on symbolic code execution techniques from the programming language community, but tuned to address the particulars of each course. These courses rely primarily on traditional means of proof authoring with pen-and-paper. This is unsatisfactory for students who receive no feedback until grading on their work and instructors who must shoulder the burden of interpreting students' proofs and giving useful feedback. To this end, we also describe the current state of Orca, an in-development proof assistant for undergraduate education that we are developing to address these issues in our courses. Finally, in teaching our courses, we have discovered a number of educational research questions about the effectiveness of code reasoning in bridging the gap between programming and mathematics, and the ability of tools like to support this pedagogy. We pose these research questions as next steps to formalize our initial experiences in our courses with the hope of eventually generalizing our approaches for wider adoption."

By using micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we discovered that AV3Sb5 commonly exhibits two distinct polar surfaces depending on the termination; electron- and hole-doped ones for the A- and Sb-termination, respectively. We observed that the kagome-derived band shows a clear splitting in the A-terminated surface while it is absent in the Sb-terminated counterpart, indicative of the polarity-dependent CDW at the surface. Close comparison of the band-dependent splitting reveals that the three-dimensional CDW structure of the K-terminated surface is different from that of the Rb- or Cs-terminated surface, suggesting the diversity of the CDW ground state. These results provide important insight into the origin of CDW in kagome superconductors AV3Sb5."

These data reveal a single oscillation mode with a period of 371.707 +/- 0.002 s and an amplitude dependent upon wavelength, with a value of 34.5 +/- 1.6 mma in the u' filter. We detected no additional frequencies in any of the light curves. Subsequently, we used the 4.1-m SOAR telescope to acquire a time-series of 248 low-resolution spectra spanning 6 hrs to look for line profile variations.

This finding provides another support to the recent interpretation of slow development of the tidal instability causing various phenomena similar to WZ Sge-type dwarf novae in SU UMa-type dwarf novae with very long orbital periods."

The system has a long period : P = 424.7 0.6 days. It comprises two main sequence stars having effective temperatures 6300 K and 5600 K, with a ratio of secondary to primary mass of 0.89 0.04. The metallicity of the system is [Fe/H] = -3.71 0.11 0.12 (random and systematic errors) -- somewhat higher than previous estimates. We find [Mg/Fe] = 0.50, typical of values of less extreme halo material. [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe], and [Ti/Fe], however, all have significantly lower values, ~ 0.0-0.1, suggesting that the heavier elements might have been underproduced relative to Mg in the material from which this object formed. In the context of the hypothesis that the abundance patterns of extremely metal-poor stars are driven by individual enrichment events and the models of Woosley and Weaver (1995), the data for CS 22876-032 are consistent with its having been enriched by a zero-metallicity supernova of mass 30 M . As the most metal-poor near-main-sequence-turnoff star currently known, the primary of the system has the potential to strongly constrain the primordial lithium abundance. We find A(Li) (= log(N(Li)/N(H)) + 12.00) = 2.03 0.07, which is consistent with the finding of Ryan et al. (1999) that for stars of extremely low metallicity A(Li) is a function of [Fe/H]."

The distribution of CS consists of an envelope component extending from north to south and a faint butterfly-shaped outflow component. The kinematic structure of the envelope is well reproduced by a simple ballistic model of an infalling rotating envelope. Although the envelope has a nearly edge-on configuration, the inclination angle of the rotation axis from the plane of the sky is found to be 5 , where we find that the western side of the envelope faces the observer. This configuration is opposite to the direction of the large-scale ( 10 AU) outflow suggested previously from the CO ( =3 2) observation, and to the morphology of infrared reflection near the protostar ( 200 AU). The latter discrepancy could originate from high extinction by the outflow cavity of the western side, these discrepancies or may indicate that the outflow axis is not parallel to the rotation axis of the envelope. Position-velocity diagrams show the accelerated outflow cavity wall, and its kinematic structure in the 2000 AU scale is explained by a standard parabolic model with the inclination angle derived from the analysis of the envelope. The different orientation of the outflow between the small and large scale implies a possibility of precession of the outflow axis. The shape and the velocity of the outflow in the vicinity of the protostar are compared with those of other protostars."

It is the first direct determination of this -value and its value of 268.66(30)\\,keV is a factor of three more precise than the currently adopted -value in the Atomic Mass Evaluation 2016. Moreover, the -value deduced from the -decay endpoint energy has been found to deviate from our result by approximately 6 standard deviations. The measurement confirms that the first-forbidden unique -decay transition is a candidate for antineutrino-mass measurements with an ultra-low -value of keV. This -value is almost an order of magnitude smaller than in any presently running or planned direct (anti)neutrino-mass experiment."

    "title": "NMR study of the Superconducting gap variation near the Mott transition in Cs$_{3}$C$_{60}$",
    "summary": "Former extensive studies of superconductivity in the A C compounds, where A is an alkali, have led to consider that Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer (BCS) electron-phonon pairing prevails in those compounds, though the incidence of electronic Coulomb repulsion has been highly debated. The discovery of two isomeric fulleride compounds Cs C which exhibit a transition with pressure from a Mott insulator (MI) to a superconducting (SC) state clearly re-opens that question. Using pressure ( ) as a single control parameter of the C balls lattice spacing, one can now study the progressive evolution of the SC properties when the electronic correlations are increased towards the critical pressure of the Mott transition. We have used C and Cs NMR measurements on the cubic phase A15-Cs C just above kbar, where the SC transition temperature displays a dome shape with decreasing cell volume. From the dependence below of the nuclear spin lattice relaxation rate we determine the electronic excitations in the SC state, that is , the SC gap value. We find that increases with decreasing towards , where decreases on the SC dome, so that increases regularly upon approaching the Mott transition. These results bring clear evidence that the increasing correlations near the Mott transition are not significantly detrimental to SC. They rather suggest that repulsive electron interactions might even reinforce elecron-phonon SC, being then partly responsible for the large values, as proposed by theoretical models taking the electronic correlations as a key ingredient."

    "title": "Rethinking and Scaling Up Graph Contrastive Learning: An Extremely Efficient Approach with Group Discrimination",
    "summary": "Graph contrastive learning (GCL) alleviates the heavy reliance on label information for graph representation learning (GRL) via self-supervised learning schemes. The core idea is to learn by maximising mutual information for similar instances, which requires similarity computation between two node instances. However, GCL is inefficient in both time and memory consumption. In addition, GCL normally requires a large number of training epochs to be well-trained on large-scale datasets. Inspired by an observation of a technical defect (i.e., inappropriate usage of Sigmoid function) commonly used in two representative GCL works, DGI and MVGRL, we revisit GCL and introduce a new learning paradigm for self-supervised graph representation learning, namely, Group Discrimination (GD), and propose a novel GD-based method called Graph Group Discrimination (GGD). Instead of similarity computation, GGD directly discriminates two groups of node samples with a very simple binary cross-entropy loss. In addition, GGD requires much fewer training epochs to obtain competitive performance compared with GCL methods on large-scale datasets. These two advantages endow GGD with very efficient property. Extensive experiments show that GGD outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on eight datasets. In particular, GGD can be trained in 0.18 seconds (6.44 seconds including data preprocessing) on ogbn-arxiv, which is orders of magnitude (10,000+) faster than GCL baselines while consuming much less memory. Trained with 9 hours on ogbn-papers100M with billion edges, GGD outperforms its GCL counterparts in both accuracy and efficiency."

The low amplitude light curves of (471931) 2013 PH44 and (250112) 2002 KY14 can be explained either by albedo variegations, binarity or elongated shape. (353222) 2009 YD7 and (514312) 2016 AE193 could be rotating elongated objects, while 2017 CX33 and 2012 VU85 are the most promising binary candidates due to their slow rotations and higher light curve amplitudes. (463368) 2012 VU85 has the longest rotation period, P=56.2h observed among Centaurs.

An as-grown crystal has a singlet ground state with a large excitation gap of K, due to the strong antiferromagnetic interaction between the two layers. Cs Cu Cl Br undergoes a structural phase transition at K accompanied by changes in the orbital configurations of Cu ions. Once a Cs Cu Cl Br crystal is heated above , its magnetic susceptibility obeys the Curie-Weiss law with decreasing temperature even below and does not exhibit anomalies at . This implies that in the heated crystal, the orbital state of the high-temperature phase remains unchanged below , and thus, this orbital state is the metastable state.

The cell has paraffin coating on the walls to increase the relaxation time. The signature of the EDM is a shift in the Larmor precession frequency which is correlated with the application of an E field. We analyze errors in the technique, and show that the main source of systematic error is the appearance of a longitudinal B field when the E field is applied. This error can be eliminated by doing measurements on the two ground hyperfine levels. Using an E field of 2.6 kV/cm, we place an upper limit on the electron EDM of e-cm ( confidence). This limit can be increased by 7 orders-of-magnitude---and brought below the current best experimental value---with easily implementable improvements to the technique."

The continuum data show a zoo of different morphologies and give detailed information on the spatial distributions, the masses, column densities and average densities of the whole sample. Fitting the radial intensity profiles shows that three parameters are needed to describe the spatial distribution of the sources: constant emission from the center out to a few arcsec radius followed by a first power law intensity distribution which steepens further outside into a second power law distribution. The mean inner power law intensity index mi (I~r^(-mi)) is 1.2 corresponding to density indices p (n~r^(-p)) of 1.6. In total the density distribution of our massive star formations sites seem to be not too different from their low-mass counterparts, but we show that setting tight constrains on the density indices is very difficult and subject to many possible errors. The local densities we derive from CS calculations are higher (up to one order of magnitude) than the mean densities we find via the mm-continuum. Such inhomogeneous density distribution reflects most likely the ubiquitous phenomenon of clumping and fragmentation in molecular clouds. Linewidth-mass relations show a departure from virial equilibrium in the stages of strongly collapsing cores."

    "summary": "A hallmark of unconventional superconductors is their complex electronic phase diagrams where \"intertwined orders\" of charge-spin-lattice degrees of freedom compete and coexist as in copper oxides and iron pnictides. While the electronic phase diagram of kagome lattice superconductor such as CsV3Sb5 also exhibits complex behavior involving coexisting and competing charge density wave order and superconductivity, much is unclear about the microscopic origin of superconductivity. Here, we study the vortex lattice (VL) in superconducting state of Cs(V0.86Ta0.14)3Sb5, where the Ta-doping suppresses charge order and enhances superconductivity. Using small-angle neutron scattering, a strictly bulk probe, we show that the VL exhibits a strikingly conventional behavior. This includes a triangular VL with a period consistent with 2e-pairing, a field dependent scattering intensity that follows a London model, and a temperature dependence consistent with a uniform superconducting gap expected for s-wave pairing. These results suggest that optimal bulk superconductivity in Cs(V1-xTax)3Sb5 arises from a conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer electron-lattice coupling, different from spin fluctuation mediated unconventional copper and iron based superconductors."

We argue that such remarkable feature of hierarchical fermion mass spectrum may be naturally understood in the scenario of gauge-Higgs unification, where the universality of fermion masses is guaranteed by the fact that Higgs boson is originally gauge boson in this scenario and also the quantized exponents may be attributed to the well-known quantization condition of magnetic charge of the magnetic monopole placed inside the torus, as the extra dimensional space. Because of the presence of the magnetic monopole, we get a chiral theory and multiple Kaluza-Klein zero modes even if we introduce only a single 6-dimensional Weyl fermion. We present two types of three generation model, which succeed to realize the remarkable hierarchical mass spectrum."

The calculations have been carried out at the Multi-Configurational Self-Consistent Field (MCSCF) level of theory. To determine the most reliant method and basis set for these calculations also the Hartree-Fock (HF) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) approaches were considered. Different DFT functionals, including B3LYP, BHandHLYP, PBE0, B3PW91 and KT3 have been employed. Furthermore, different active spaces were evaluated to optimize MCSCF. To establish the accuracy of the methods the computed rotational g-factors were compared to experimental values. The benchmark study of CO and CS shows that the MCSCF method provides most reliable results and that the aug-cc-pCV5Z basis set is the most sufficient. The aug-cc-pCVQZ basis set for Li and aug-cc-pV5Z basis set for H gave best results for LiH. The active spaces tested for CO and CS do not yet converge towards the experimental values when more determinants were included. However, if the g-factors are vibrationally averaged, the computed values are seen to move towards the experimental value. Lastly, the g-factors have been vibrationally averaged, and it shows a slight improved agreement between computed values and experimental data."

    "summary": "Due to the discarding of downlink channel state information (CSI) amplitude and the employing of iteration reconstruction algorithms, 1-bit compressed sensing (CS)-based superimposed CSI feedback is challenged by low recovery accuracy and large processing delay. To overcome these drawbacks, this letter proposes a fusion learning scheme by exploiting the bi-directional channel reciprocity. Specifically, a simplified version of the conventional downlink CSI reconstruction is utilized to extract the initial feature of downlink CSI, and a single hidden layer-based amplitude-learning network (AMPL-NET) is designed to learn the auxiliary feature of the downlink CSI amplitude. Then, based on the extracted and learned amplitude features, a simple but effective amplitude-fusion network (AMPF-NET) is developed to perform the amplitude fusion of downlink CSI and thus improves the reconstruction accuracy for 1-bit CS-based superimposed CSI feedback while reducing the processing delay. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed feedback scheme and the robustness against parameter variations."

Also the long-standing problems concerning the property of Higgs and its interactions are still there, and we still do not have any conclusive argument of the origin of the Higgs itself. In this article we focus on higher-dimensional theories as new physics. First we give a brief review of their representative scenarios and closely related 4-dimensional scenarios. Among them, we mainly discuss two interesting possibilities of the origin of the Higgs: Higgs as a gauge boson and Higgs as a (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson. Next, we argue that theories of new physics are divided into two categories, i.e. theories with normal Higgs interactions and those with anomalous Higgs interactions. Interestingly both of two candidates concerning the origin of the Higgs mentioned above predict characteristic \"anomalous\" Higgs interactions, such as the deviation of the Yukawa couplings from the standard model predictions. Such deviations can be hopefully investigated by the precision tests of Higgs interactions at the planned ILC experiment. Also discussed is the main decay mode of the Higgs, . Again, theories belonging different categories are known to predict remarkably different new physics contributions to this important process."

Selective reflection of laser radiation from an interface of dielectric window and atomic vapor confined in a nanocell with 300 nm gap thickness was implemented for the experimental studies. The real time derivative of selective reflection signal with a frequency position coinciding with atomic transitions was used in measurements, providing 40 MHz spectral resolution and linearity of signal response in respect to transition probability. Behavior of 28 individual Zeeman transitions in a wide range of longitudinal magnetic field (0 - 6 kG) has been tracked under excitation of Cs vapor by a low-intensity - polarized cw laser radiation. For kG, only 8 transitions with nearly equal probabilities and the same frequency slope remained in the spectrum, which is a manifestation of the hyperfine Paschen-Back regime. The obtained experimental results are consistent with numerical modeling. Due to small divergence of selective reflection signal, as well as sub-wavelength thickness and sub-Doppler spectral linewidth inherent to nanocell, the employed technique can be used for distant remote sensing of magnetic field with high spatial and -field resolution."

However, the abundances for the lighter elements in our sample, from Ge to Sn (31 Z 50), do not scale with the solar abundance pattern. Moreover, the Ge abundance is deficient relative to solar, indicating that it is dominantly an iron-peak rather than neutron-capture element.

The ionized edges of this cloud forms the Arched Filament HII regions which are ionized by the adjacent Arches stellar cluster. The OVRO data were combined with single-dish data obtained at the 30-m IRAM telescope by Serabyn & Guesten (1987). A comparison of this CS(2-1) data and the H92alpha recombination line data of Lang, Goss & Morris (2001) reveals that the ionized and molecular gas are physically related, but that their velocities in this region differ by up to 35 km/s. This difference in velocity can be understood if the gas that gave rise to the G0.07+0.04 HII region has been fully ionized. An overall comparison of the molecular and ionized gas across the entire -30 km/s cloud based on the single dish CS(2-1) data and the H92alpha line data illustrates that such differences in velocity between the ionized and molecular gas are common and that the geometrical arrangement of these components is complicated. Much of the ionized gas resides on the near side (to the observer) of the molecular cloud; however, in several regions, some molecular material must lie in front of the HII region. The Arches stellar cluster therefore appears to be located in the midst of the molecular clouds such that some of the near-side cloud surfaces along our line of sight have not been exposed to the ionizing radiation."

While the Fermi surface gapped by the CDW grows, is elevated in CsV Sb , indicating that the interplay between the CDW and superconductivity is not simply a competition for the density of states near .

    "title": "Beyond Smoothing: Unsupervised Graph Representation Learning with Edge Heterophily Discriminating",
    "summary": "Unsupervised graph representation learning (UGRL) has drawn increasing research attention and achieved promising results in several graph analytic tasks. Relying on the homophily assumption, existing UGRL methods tend to smooth the learned node representations along all edges, ignoring the existence of heterophilic edges that connect nodes with distinct attributes. As a result, current methods are hard to generalize to heterophilic graphs where dissimilar nodes are widely connected, and also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To address this issue, we propose a novel unsupervised Graph Representation learning method with Edge hEterophily discriminaTing (GREET) which learns representations by discriminating and leveraging homophilic edges and heterophilic edges. To distinguish two types of edges, we build an edge discriminator that infers edge homophily/heterophily from feature and structure information. We train the edge discriminator in an unsupervised way through minimizing the crafted pivot-anchored ranking loss, with randomly sampled node pairs acting as pivots. Node representations are learned through contrasting the dual-channel encodings obtained from the discriminated homophilic and heterophilic edges. With an effective interplaying scheme, edge discriminating and representation learning can mutually boost each other during the training phase. We conducted extensive experiments on 14 benchmark datasets and multiple learning scenarios to demonstrate the superiority of GREET."

    "summary": "The s-enhanced and very metal-poor star CS 30322-023 shows a puzzling abundance pattern of the neutron-capture elements, i.e. several neutron-capture elements such as Ba, Pb etc. show enhancement, but other neutron-capture elements such as Sr, Eu etc. exhibit deficient with respect to iron. The study to this sample star could make people gain a better understanding of s- and r-process nucleosynthesis at low metallicity. Using a parametric model, we find that the abundance pattern of the neutron-capture elements could be best explained by a star that was polluted by an AGB star and the CS 30322-023 binary system formed in a molecular cloud which had never been polluted by r-process material. The lack of r-process material also indicates that the AGB companion cannot have undergone a type-1.5 supernova, and thus must have had an initial mass below 4.0M , while the strong N overabundance and the absence of a strong C overabundance indicate that the companion's initial mass was larger than 2.0M . The smaller s-process component coefficient of this star illustrates that there is less accreted material of this star from the AGB companion, and the sample star should be formed in the binary system with larger initial orbital separation where the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) mechanism can not work."

Additional transitions of H CS in its lowest four excited vibrational states were recorded in selected regions between 571 and 1386 GHz. Slight to strong Coriolis interactions occur between all four vibrational states with the exception of the two highest lying states because both are totally symmetric vibrations. We present combined analyses of the ground and the four interacting states for our rotational data of H CS and H C S. The H CS data were supplemented with two sets of high-resultion IR data in two separate analyses. The state has been included in analyses of Coriolis interactions of low-lying fundamental states of H CS for the first time and this improved the quality of the fits substantially.

It was found that the broad excitation continuum without a marked structure spreads in a wide energy range from to approximately in contrast to the clearly structured excitation continuum observed in the spin-1/2 triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet. These findings strongly suggest spinon excitations as elementary excitations in Cs Cu SnF . In Rb Cu SnF , singlet-triplet excitations from the pinwheel VBS state and their ghost modes caused by the enlargement of the chemical unit cell were clearly confirmed. It was found that the excitation continuum is structured in the low-energy region approximately below and the almost structureless high-energy excitation continuum extends to approximately . The characteristics of the high-energy excitation continuum are common to both Cs Cu SnF and Rb Cu SnF , irrespective of their ground states.

Our analysis is based on high signal-to-noise, high-resolution (R~75000) VLT/UVES spectra and MARCS model atmospheres under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium, and obtains abundance measurements for a total of 46 elements, 31 of which are neutron-capture elements.

We confirm our previous detection of Th, and demonstrate that this star does not exhibit an \"actinide boost\". Uranium is also detected (log e(U) =-2.20+/-0.30), albeit with a large measurement error that hampers its use as a precision cosmo-chronometer. Combining the various elemental chronometer pairs that are available for this star, we derive a mean age of 12.2+/-3.7 Gyr using the theoretical production ratios from waiting-point approximation models (Kratz et al. 2007). We further explore the high-entropy wind model (Farouqi et al. 2010) production ratios arising from different neutron richness of the ejecta (Y_e), and derive an age of 13.7+/-4.4 Gyr for a best-fitting Y_e=0.447. The U/Th nuclei-chronometer is confirmed to be the most resilient to theoretical production ratios and yields an age of 16.5+:-6.6 Gyr.

Using VLT-UVES spectra of unprecedented quality, regarding resolution and S/N ratio, covering a wide wavelength range (from to 900 nm), we have determined abundances for 21 elements in this star over a wide range of atomic mass. The major new discovery is an exceptionally large oxygen enhancement, [O/Fe] , as measured from the [OI] line at 630.0 nm. We find an enhancement of [N/Fe] of , and a milder one of [C/Fe] 0.1, similar to those already reported in the literature. This implies . We also find carbon isotopic ratios C/ C and C/ N , close to the equilibrium value of the CN cycle. Lithium is not detected. Na is strongly enhanced ([Na/Fe] ), while S and K are not detected. The silicon-burning elements Cr and Mn are underabundant, while Co and Zn are overabundant ([Zn/Fe] ). Zn is measured for the first time in such an extremely metal-poor star. The abundances of the neutron-capture elements Sr, Y, and Ba are strongly decreasing with the atomic number of the element: [Sr/Fe] , [Y/Fe] , and [Ba/Fe] . Among possible progenitors of CS 22949--037, we discuss the pair-instability supernovae. Such very massive objects indeed produce large amounts of oxygen, and have been found to be possible sources of primary nitrogen. Other scenarios are also discussed.

However, the key electronic states responsible for such a phase diagram have yet to be clarified. Here we report a systematic micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) study of Cs(V1-xCrx)3Sb5 as a function of Cr content x, where Cr substitution causes monotonic reduction of superconducting and CDW transition temperatures. We found that the V-derived bands forming saddle points at the M point and Dirac nodes along high-symmetry cuts show an energy shift due to electron doping by Cr substitution, whereas the Sb-derived electron band at the Gamma point remains almost unchanged, signifying an orbital-selective band shift. We also found that band doubling associated with the emergence of three-dimensional CDW identified at x = 0 vanishes at x = 0.25, in line with the disappearance of CDW. A comparison of band diagrams among Ti-, Nb-, and Cr-substituted Cs(V1-xCrx)3Sb5 suggests the importance to simultaneously take into account the two saddle points at the M point and their proximity to the Fermi energy, to understand the complex phase diagram against carrier doping and chemical pressure."

Here we present ALMA observations at subarsecond resolution, complemented with IRAM-30m data, of several lines of SiO, SiS, and CS towards the best-studied AGB circumstellar envelope, IRC+10216. We aim to characterise their spatial distribution and determine their fractional abundances mainly through radiative transfer and chemical modelling. The three species display extended emission with several enhanced emission shells. CS displays the most extended distribution reaching distances up to approximately 20''. SiS and SiO emission have similar sizes of approximately 11'', but SiS emission is slightly more compact. We have estimated fractional abundances relative to H , which on average are equal to f(SiO) 10 , f(SiS) 10 , and f(CS) 10 up to the photo-dissociation region. The observations and analysis presented here show evidence that the circumstellar material displays clear deviations from an homogeneous spherical wind, with clumps and low density shells that may allow UV photons from the interstellar medium (ISM) to penetrate deep into the envelope, shifting the photo-dissociation radius inwards. Our chemical model predicts photo-dissociation radii compatible with those derived from the observations, although it is unable to predict abundance variations from the starting radius of the calculations ( 10 ), which may reflect the simplicity of the model. We conclude that the spatial distribution of the gas proves the episodic and variable nature of the mass loss mechanism of IRC+10216, on timescales of hundreds of years."

The amplitude of the CPT spectrum excited by lin || lin polarizations is enhanced as the excitation intensity increases and is well explained by the three-level model without trap levels.

Each atomic system can detect radio frequency (RF) electric (E) field strengths through modification of the EIT signal (Autler-Townes (AT) splitting), which leads to a direct SI traceable RF E-field measurement. We show that these two systems can detect the same the RF E-field strength simultaneously, which provides a direct in situ comparison of Rb and Cs RF measurements in Rydberg atoms. In effect, this allows us to perform two independent measurements of the same quantity in the same laboratory, providing two different immediate and independent measurements. This gives two measurements that helps rule out systematic effects and uncertainties in this E-field metrology approach, which are important when establishing an international measurement standard for an E-field strength and is a necessary step for this method to be accepted as a standard calibration technique. We use this approach to measure E-fields at 9.2~GHz, 11.6~GHz, and 13.4~GHz, which correspond to three different atomic states (different principal atomic numbers and angular momentums) for the two atom species."

By comparative measurements of the magnetic susceptibility ( ) on as many as eighteen different Br concentrations, we found that the inplane and out-of-plane magnetic correlations, probed by the position and height of a maximum in the magnetic susceptibility, respectively, do not show a smooth variation with x. Instead three distinct concentration regimes can be identified, which are separated by critical concentrations x = 1 and x = 2. This unusual magnetic behavior can be explained by considering the structural peculiarities of the materials, especially the distorted Cu-halide tetrahedra, which support a site-selective replacement of Cl- by Br- ions. Consequently, the critical concentrations x (x ) mark particularly interesting systems, where one (two) halidesublattice positions are fully occupied."

The hydrogen column density for the proto-BDs derived from the CO gas emission is 2-15 times lower than that derived from the dust continuum emission, indicating CO depletion from the gas-phase. The mean H CO ortho-to-para ratio is 3 for the proto-BDs and indicates gas-phase formation for H CO. We have investigated the correlations in the molecular abundances between the proto-BDs and protostars. Proto-BDs on average show a factor of 2 higher ortho-to-para H CO ratio than the protostars. Possible explanations include a difference in the H CO formation mechanism, spin-selective photo-dissociation, self-shielding effects, or different emitting regions for the ortho and para species. There is a tentative trend of a decline in the HCO and H CO abundances with decreasing bolometric luminosity, while the CS and CO abundances show no particular difference between the proto-BDs and protostars. These trends reflect the scaled-down physical structures for the proto-BDs compared to protostars and differences in the peak emitting regions for these species. The C O isotopologue is detected in all of the proto-BDs as well as the more evolved Class Flat/Class II BDs in our sample, and can probe the quiescent gas at both early and late evolutionary stages."

Our final values, with the estimated uncertainties, show reasonably good agreement with the previous calculations and available experimental results. Differences among the DHF, MBPT(2), MBPT(3) and RPA results indicate pair-correlation (PC) effects play major roles than the core-polarization (CP) effects in the determination of values in Cs.

Our analysis is based on high angular resolution observations in at least two transitions of NH3, N2H+, CS, C34S, C18O, and C17O, together with maps of the 1.2 mm continuum. For both cores, we derive radial profiles of constant temperature and constant turbulence, together with density distributions close to those of non-singular isothermal spheres. Using these physical conditions and a Monte Carlo radiative transfer model, we derive abundance profiles for all species and model the strong chemical differentiation of the core interiors. According to our models, the NH3 abundance increases toward the core centers by a factor of several while N2H+ has a constant abundance over most of the cores. In contrast, both C18O and CS (and isotopomers) are strongly depleted in the core interiors, most likely due to their freeze out onto grains at densities of a few 10^4 cm^ -3 . Concerning the kinematics of the dense gas, we find (in addition to constant turbulence) a pattern of internal motions at the level of 0.1 km s^ -1 . These motions seem correlated with asymmetries in the pattern of molecular depletion, and we interpret them as residuals of core contraction. Their distribution and size suggest that core formation occurs in a rather irregular manner and with a time scale of a Myr. A comparison of our derived core properties with those predicted by supersonic turbulence models of core formation shows that our Taurus cores are much more quiescent than representative predictions from these models."

In recent days, the employment of drones has been escalated in several applications that are not limited to surveillance, delivery systems, aerial warfare, and agricultural activities. Aerial imaging of ground targets is highly challenging because of various factors that affect light propagation through different mediums. Several convolutional neural network-based object detection algorithms that are developed require more robustness when applied in the field of aerial imaging and remote sensing. In order to handle the adverse effects of light propagation with respect to time and solar radiance, adaptive RGB filters for grayscale imaging based on weighted luminance are introduced that extensively solve the problem of rayleigh scattering effect. Images of objects that are easily diminished by rayleigh scattering are acquired in various timezones. The acquired images are labelled precisely and subjected to training and validation.

In addition, we measure the hyperfine structure of the 7P energy level based on the heterodyne measurements, and calculate the magnetic dipole constant of the Cs 7P level to be 94.38(6) MHz, which agrees well with previous measurements. This compact optical frequency standard can also be used in other applications that require high-stability lasers, such as laser interferometry, laser cooling, geodesy, and so on."

The quenching factor (QF) for particles increases smoothly from QF = 0.30 at RT to QF = 0.36 at 135 K. The shape of scintillation pulses induced by particles is characterized by three time-constants (0.3, 2.5 and 11.8 s at RT), whereas the average pulse of induced events is characterized by two time-constants (1.3 and 11.5 s at RT).

    "summary": "We report on the development and phase noise performance of a 9.1926 GHz microwave frequency synthesizer to be used as the local oscillator for a Cs fountain clock. It is based on frequency multiplication and synthesis from an ultralow phase noise 5 MHz Oven Controlled Crystal Oscillator (OCXO) and 100 MHz Voltage Controlled Crystal Oscillator (VCXO).The key component of the frequency multiplication is a non-linear transmission-line (NLTL) used as a frequency comb generator. The phase noise of the synthesizer is improved by carefully optimizing the input power, the input and output impedances of the NLTL. The absolute phase noises of the 9.1926 GHz output signal are measured to be -64 dBc/Hz, -83 dBc/Hz, -92 dBc/Hz, -117 dBc/Hz and -119 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz, 10Hz, 100Hz, 1 kHz and 10 kHz offset frequencies, respectively. The residual phase noise of the synthesizer is measured to be -82 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz offset frequency. The measurement result shows that the absolute phase noise at the frequency range of 1 - 100 Hz is mainly limited by the phase noise of the OCXO. The contribution of the absolute phase noise to the fountain clock short-term frequency stability is calculated to be 7.0x10^(-14). The residual frequency stability of the synthesizer is measured to be1.5x10^(-14), which is consistent with the calculated frequency stability due to the residual phase noise of the synthesizer. Meanwhile we designed and realized an interferometric microwave switch in the synthesizer to eliminate the frequency shifts induced by the microwave leakage. The extinction ratio of the switch is measured to be more than 50 dB. In the scheme, we use only commercially available components to build the microwave frequency synthesizer with excellent phase noise performance for high-performance Cs fountain clocks."

Evidence of intertwined charge density wave (CDW) and superconducting order parameters has recently been observed in a novel kagome material AV3Sb5 (A=K,Rb,Cs) that features a Z2 topological invariant in the electronic structure. However, the origin of the CDW and its intricate interplay with topological state has yet to be determined. Here, using hard x-ray scattering, we demonstrate a three-dimensional (3D) CDW with 2*2*2 superstructure in (Rb,Cs)V3Sb5. Unexpectedly, we find that the CDW fails to induce acoustic phonon anomalies at the CDW wavevector but yields a novel Raman mode which quickly damps into a broad continuum below the CDW transition temperature. Our observations exclude strong electron-phonon coupling driven CDW in AV3Sb5 and point to an unconventional and electronic-driven mechanism that couples the CDW and the topological band structure."

    "summary": "Marine debris poses a significant threat to the survival of marine wildlife, often leading to entanglement and starvation, ultimately resulting in death. Therefore, removing debris from the ocean is crucial to restore the natural balance and allow marine life to thrive. Instance segmentation is an advanced form of object detection that identifies objects and precisely locates and separates them, making it an essential tool for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to navigate and interact with their underwater environment effectively. AUVs use image segmentation to analyze images captured by their cameras to navigate underwater environments. In this paper, we use instance segmentation to calculate the area of individual objects within an image, we use YOLOV7 in Roboflow to generate a set of bounding boxes for each object in the image with a class label and a confidence score for every detection. A segmentation mask is then created for each object by applying a binary mask to the object's bounding box. The masks are generated by applying a binary threshold to the output of a convolutional neural network trained to segment objects from the background. Finally, refining the segmentation mask for each object is done by applying post-processing techniques such as morphological operations and contour detection, to improve the accuracy and quality of the mask. The process of estimating the area of instance segmentation involves calculating the area of each segmented instance separately and then summing up the areas of all instances to obtain the total area. The calculation is carried out using standard formulas based on the shape of the object, such as rectangles and circles. In cases where the object is complex, the Monte Carlo method is used to estimate the area. This method provides a higher degree of accuracy than traditional methods, especially when using a large number of samples."

We study the impact of the H-bonding of water as a solvent molecule on real-time electron transfer dynamics across a Cs+-Cu(111) ion-metal interface using femtosecond time-resolved two-photon photoelectron spectroscopy. We distinguish in the formed water-alkali aggregates two regimes below and above two water molecules per ion. Upon crossing the boundary of these regimes, the lifetime of the excess electron localized transiently at the Cs+ ion increases from 40 to 60 femtoseconds, which indicates a reduced alkali-metal interaction. Furthermore, the energy transferred to a dynamic structural rearrangement due to hydration is reduced from 0.3 to 0.2 eV concomitantly. These effects are a consequence of H-bonding and the beginning formation of a nanoscale water network. This finding is supported by real-space imaging of the solvatomers and vibrational frequency shifts of the OH stretch and bending modes calculated for these specific interfaces."

The problem, along with its two previously proposed variants sGASP and gGASP, has been studied in the parameterized complexity setting with various parameterizations, such as number of agents, number of activities and solution size. However, the complexity of the problem parameterized by the number of types of agents, a parameter motivated and proposed already in the paper that introduced GASP, has so far remained open. In this paper we establish the complexity map for GASP, sGASP and gGASP when the number of types of agents is the parameter. Our positive results, consisting of one fixed-parameter algorithm and one XP algorithm, rely on a combination of novel Subset Sum machinery (which may be of general interest) and identifying certain compression steps which allow us to focus on solutions which are \"acyclic\". These algorithms are complemented by matching lower bounds, which among others answer an open question of Gupta, Roy, Saurabh and Zehavi (2017). In this direction, the techniques used to establish W[1]-hardness of sGASP are of particular interest: as an intermediate step, we use Sidon sequences to show the W[1]-hardness of a highly restricted variant of multi-dimensional Subset Sum, which may find applications in other settings as well."

    "summary": "The recently discovered coexistence of superconductivity and charge density wave order in the kagome systems AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) has stimulated enormous interest. According to theory, a vanadium-based kagome system may host a flat band, nontrivial linear dispersive Dirac surface states and electronic correlation. Despite intensive investigations, it remains controversial about the origin of the charge density wave (CDW) order, how does the superconductivity relate to the CDW, and whether the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) arises primarily from the kagome lattice or the CDW order. We report an extensive investigation on Cs(V1-xNbx)3Sb5 samples with systematic Nb doping. Our results show that the Nb doping induces apparent suppression of CDW order and promotes superconductivity; meanwhile, the AHE and magnetoresistance (MR) will be significantly weakened together with the CDW order. Combining with our density functional calculations, we interpret these effects by an antiphase shift of the Fermi energy with respect to the saddle points near M and the Fermi surface centered around Γ. It is found that the former depletes the filled states for the CDW instability and worsens the nesting condition for CDW order; while the latter lifts the Fermi level upward and enlarges the Fermi surface surrounding the Γ point, and thus promotes superconductivity. Our results uncover a delicate but unusual competition between the CDW order and superconductivity."

This electric field also enables resonances which do not respect the dipole-dipole selection rules under zero field. A few of these quasi-forbidden resonances have been observed but they are often overlooked. Here we show that in cold Cs atoms there is a large number of these resonances that display a significant transfer efficiency due to their strong interactions, even at low electric field. We also develop a graphical method enabling to find all possible resonances simultaneously. The resulting dramatic increase in the total number of addressable resonant energy transfers at different electric fields could have implications in the search for few-body interactions or macro-molecules built from Rydberg atoms."

Aims. We aim to constrain the chemical composition of the CSE and determine the radial abundance distribution, the photospheric peak abundance, and isotopic ratios of a selection of chemically important molecular species in the innermost CSE of W Aql. The derived parameters are put into the context of the chemical evolution of AGB stars and are compared with theoretical models. Methods. We employ one-dimensional radiative transfer modeling - with the accelerated lambda iteration (ALI) radiative transfer code - of the radial abundance distribution of a total of five molecular species (CS, SiS, 30SiS, 29SiO and H13CN) and determine the best fitting model parameters based on high-resolution ALMA observations as well as archival single-dish observations. The additional advantage of the spatially resolved ALMA observations is that we can directly constrain the radial profile of the observed line transitions from the observations. Results. We derive abundances and e-folding radii for CS, SiS, 30SiS, 29SiO and H13CN and compare them to previous studies, which are based only on unresolved single-dish spectra.

    "title": "Order Reduction of Nonlinear Quasi-periodic Systems Subjected to External Excitations",
    "summary": "In his paper, we present order reduction techniques for nonlinear quasi-periodic systems subjected to external excitations. The order reduction techniques presented here are based on the Lyapunov-Perrone (L-P) Transformation. For a class of non-resonant quasi-periodic systems, the L-P transformation can convert a linear quasi-periodic system into a linear time-invariant one. This Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system retains the dynamics of the original quasi-periodic system. Once this LTI system is obtained, the tools and techniques available for analysis of LTI systems can be used, and the results could be obtained for the original quasi-periodic system via the L-P transformation. This approach is similar to using the Lyapunov-Floquet (L-F) transformation to convert a linear time-periodic system into an LTI system and perform analysis and control. Order reduction is a systematic way of constructing dynamical system models with relatively smaller states that accurately retain large-scale systems' essential dynamics. In this work, reduced-order modeling techniques for nonlinear quasi-periodic systems subjected to external excitations are presented. The methods proposed here use the L-P transformation that makes the linear part of transformed equations time-invariant. In this work, two order reduction techniques are suggested. The first method is simply an application of the well-known Guyan like reduction method to nonlinear systems. The second technique is based on the concept of an invariant manifold for quasi-periodic systems. The 'quasi-periodic invariant manifold' based technique yields' reducibility conditions.' These conditions help us to understand the various types of resonant interactions in the system. These resonances indicate energy interactions between the system states, nonlinearity, and external excitation."

It is known that the disproportionation is resolved under high pressures, and this has stimulated many studies into the pressurization of these materials. At present, the phase changes in these materials are still strongly contested. Here, we use density functional theory to study the pressure-dependent behavior of Cs Au X . We find that a tetragonal--cubic transition occurs directly from the ground state structure. Even so, we also found an intermediate tetragonal structure to be very close in energy, suggesting it to be observable. We also find several other competing metastable phases, which explains some of the controversies in the literature. Focusing on one of the metastable phases, we suggest that Cs Au X can be prepared in a structure, analogous to that of KCuF . The band gap in the structure widened as atomic number of the halide was increased, which is the inverse trend compared to the ground state structure. We explain this by the different octahedral distortion ordering in the two structural phases. Furthermore, we show that the conduction band in is three dimensionally connected, which is favorable for opto-electronic applications. We submit that this work demonstrates that octahedral distortion ordering is a promising avenue for developing new double perovskites and suggests it to be particular effective in tuning the electronic structure properties."

Here, we shed light on promising photovoltaic properties of gold mixed-valence halide perovskites Cs Au X (X = I, Br, Cl). They satisfy fundamental requirements such as nontoxicity, better stability, a band gap in the visible range, and a low excitonic binding energy. Our study shows a favorable electronic structure, resulting in a high optical-transition strength, and thus a sharp rise in the absorption spectrum near the band gap. This, in turn, yields a very high short-circuit current density and hence higher simulated efficiency compared with MAPbI . However, careful investigation of defect physics reveals the possibility of deep-level defects (such as V , V , X , X , Au , and Au , X = I, Br), depending on the growth conditions. These can act as carrier traps and become detrimental to photovoltaic performance. The present study should help in taking necessary precautions in synthesizing these compounds in a controlled chemical environment, which should minimize performance limiting defects and pave the way for future studies on this class of materials."

From the detail analysis of electron correlations, we find that the corrections from the Breit interaction and QED effects are important to get accurate results of NSD-PNC amplitudes in Cs. The largest cumulative contribution from the Breit and QED corrections is found to be 3.2\\% of the total value. The upper bound on the theoretical uncertainty in our calculated NSD-PNC amplitudes is estimated to be about 1\\%."

    "summary": "The recently discovered layered kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A=K, Rb, and Cs) attract intensive interest due to their intertwining with superconductivity, charge-density-wave state, and nontrivial band topology. In this work, we show by first-principles calculations and symmetry arguments that unconventional type-II Dirac nodal line fermions close to the fermi level are present in another latest class of experimentally synthesized kagome compounds AV6Sb6 (A=K, Rb, and Cs). These compounds possess a unique kagome (V3Sb)2 bilayer that dominates their electronic and topological properties, instead of the kagome V3Sb monolayer in AV3Sb5. Crystal symmetry guarantees that the type-II Dirac nodal lines with quantized Berry phase lie in reflection-invariant planes of the Brillouin zone. We further reveal that the type-II Dirac nodal lines remain nearly intact in the presence of spin-orbital coupling and can be categorized as a Z2 classification. The findings establish AV6Sb6 as a class of new fascinating prototypes, which will extend the knowledge of interplay between unconventionally topological fermions and exotic quantum ordered states in kagome systems."

    "title": "Finding the Missing-half: Graph Complementary Learning for Homophily-prone and Heterophily-prone Graphs",
    "summary": "Real-world graphs generally have only one kind of tendency in their connections. These connections are either homophily-prone or heterophily-prone. While graphs with homophily-prone edges tend to connect nodes with the same class (i.e., intra-class nodes), heterophily-prone edges tend to build relationships between nodes with different classes (i.e., inter-class nodes). Existing GNNs only take the original graph during training. The problem with this approach is that it forgets to take into consideration the ``missing-half\" structural information, that is, heterophily-prone topology for homophily-prone graphs and homophily-prone topology for heterophily-prone graphs. In our paper, we introduce Graph cOmplementAry Learning, namely GOAL, which consists of two components: graph complementation and complemented graph convolution. The first component finds the missing-half structural information for a given graph to complement it. The complemented graph has two sets of graphs including both homophily- and heterophily-prone topology. In the latter component, to handle complemented graphs, we design a new graph convolution from the perspective of optimisation. The experiment results show that GOAL consistently outperforms all baselines in eight real-world datasets."

A new, purely collective interpretation of these bands is given on the basis of the used boson-fermion dynamical symmetry of the model. The energy levels of the doublet bands as well as the absolute and transition probabilities between the states of both yrast and yrare bands are described quite well. The observed odd-even staggering of both and values is reproduced by the introduction of an appropriate interaction term of quadrupole type, which produces such a staggering effect in the transition strengths. The calculations show that the appearance of doublet bands in certain odd-odd nuclei could be a consequence of the realization of a larger dynamical symmetry based on the non-compact supersymmetry group ."

However, the velocity criterion used to select the original sample results in an additional 422 galaxies without HI detection that ought to have been included in the S G on the basis of their optical recession velocities. In order to create a complete magnitude-, size- and volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies, we collect m and -band images using archival data from different surveys and complement it with new observations for the missing galaxies. We denote the sample of these additional galaxies as Disc Galaxy (DG) extension. We present the Complete Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (CS G), encompassing a sample of galaxies with consistent imaging, surface brightness profiles, photometric parameters, and revised morphological classification. Following the original strategy of the S G survey, we produce masks, surface brightness profiles, and curves of growth using masked m and -band images. From these profiles, we derive the integrated quantities: total magnitude, stellar mass, concentration parameter, and galaxy size, converting to m. We re-measure these parameters also for the S G and ETG to create a homogenous sample. We present new morphological revised -types, and we showcase mid-IR scaling relations for the photometric parameters. We complete the S G sample by incorporating 422 galaxies. The CS G includes at least 99.94\\% of the complete sample of nearby galaxies, meeting the original selection criteria, and it will enable a wide set of investigations into galaxy structure and evolution."

The backbone of these studies are well-structured and reproducible workflows efficiently returning the desired properties given chemical compositions and atomic arrangements as sole input. Herein, we present a new workflow designed to compute the stability and the electronic properties of crystalline materials from density-functional theory using the SCAN approximation for the exchange-correlation potential. We show the performance of the developed tool exploring the binary Cs-Te phase space which hosts cesium telluride, a semiconducting material widely used as photocathode in particle accelerators. Starting from a pool of structures retrieved from open computational material databases, we analyze formation energies as a function of relative Cs content and for a few selected crystals, we investigate the band structures and density of states unraveling interconnections among structure, stochiometry, stability, and electronic properties. Our study contributes to the ongoing research on alkali-based photocahodes and demonstrates that high-throughput calculations based on state-of-the-art first-principles methods can complement experiments in the search for optimal materials for next-generation electron sources."

We demonstrate that the crossover detected in the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (around 150 K in RbFe As and around 75 K in CsFe As ), from a high temperature nearly localized to a low temperature delocalized behaviour, is associated with the onset of an inhomogeneous local charge distribution causing the broadening or even the splitting of the NQR spectra as well as an increase in the muon spin relaxation rate. We argue that this crossover, occurring at temperatures well above the phase transition to the nematic long-range order, is associated with a charge disproportionation at the Fe sites induced by competing Hund's and Coulomb couplings. In RbFe As around 35 K, far below that crossover temperature, we observe a peak in the NQR which is possibly associated with the critical slowing down of electronic nematic fluctuations on approaching the transition to the nematic long-range order."

The observations were obtained with the Yebes radio telescope. Observations with the IRAM 30m of the most abundant isotopologues of these species are also presented and used to estimate volume densities and to constrain the excitation conditions. We report the first detection in space of C13C34S, CC33S, CCC33S, HC33S+, and HCC34S+. C36S is also detected for the first time in a cold object. We also complemented with maps that provide the spatial distribution of most of these species. Using the available collisional rate coefficients for each species, we modeled the observed line intensities using the large velocity gradient method for the radiative transfer. We report the most complete analysis of the column densities of the CnS family and to compare the abundance ratios of all detected isotopologues. Adopting a T_k for TMC-1 of 9K, we found that n(H2)=0.9-1.5X10^4cm-3 can explain the observed decline in intensity with increasing J. We derived the rot. constants for the C13C34S, CC33S, CCC33S, HC33S+, and HCC34S+ isotopologues from new laboratory data and complemented them with the frequencies of the observed lines. We find that all S isotopologues are consistent with solar isotopic abundance ratios. Accurate 12C/13C abundances were derived and, as previously suggested, the 13C isotopologues of CCS and CCCS show strong abundance anomalies depending on the position of the substituted carbon. Nevertheless, the 12C/13C abundance ratio is practically identical to the solar value for CS, HCS+, and H2CS. We also searched for the isotopologues of other S-bearing molecules. The expected intensities for their 34S and 13C isotopologues are too low to be detected with the present sensitivity of the QUIJOTE, however."

Numerical calculation is performed with quenched QCD on 32^4 lattice using the standard plaquette action at beta=5.7 with the standard Wilson quark action with kappa=0.1640, 0.1665, 0.1678. Preliminary results show that the depths of the resulting tensor force amount to 20 to 40 MeV, which is enhanced in the light quark mass region. (ii) Nuclear force from 2+1 flavor QCD with PACS-CS gauge configuration: Preliminary full QCD results are obtained by using 2+1 flavor gauge configurations generated by PACS-CS collaboration. The resulting potential has the midium range attraction of about 30 MeV similar to the preceding quenched calculations.

The ionization potential extracted for both series from the modified Ritz formula agrees with our measurements based on the S and D series. Fine-structure intervals are calculated and parameterized. The wave functions computed for the energies from the quantum defects are used to calculate transition dipole moments. We compare the reduced electric-dipole matrix elements with available benchmarks and find agreement within the precision of those works. The scalar and tensor polarizabilities of the , , and series are calculated based on the now more accurate set of wave functions. Moreover, we report the polarizability as a series in powers of the effective principal quantum number and find the main coefficients of the expansion.

The domain of such a function in the case of two-qubit system with X or centrosymmetric (CS) density matrix can consist at most of three subdomains: two ones, where the quantum discord is expressed in closed analytical forms (Q_0 and Q_ π/2 ), and an intermediate subdomain in which for determining the quantum discord Q_θit is required to solve numerically a one-dimensional minimization problem to find the optimal measurement angle θ (0,π/2). Exact equations for determining the boundaries between these subdomains are obtained and solved for a number of models. The Q_θsubdomains are discovered in the anisotropic spin dimers in external field. On the other hand, coinciding boundaries and therefore sudden transitions between optimal measurement angles θ=π/2 and θ=0 are observed in dynamics of spin currying particles in closed nanopore and also in phase flip channels. In latter cases the solutions are entirely analytical."

In addition analytical expressions based on a quasi-classical picture for spin fluctuations are derived, which show good agreement with the quantum-approach for temperatures K.

A 2.298~GHz signal, generated by an oscillator constructed around a thermally-controlled two-port AlN-sapphire HBAR resonator with a Q-factor of 24000 at 68 C, is frequency multiplied by 2 to 4.596~GHz, half of the Cs atom clock frequency. The temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) of the HBAR is measured to be ~ppm/ C at 2.298~GHz. The measured phase noise of the 4.596~GHz source is ~dBrad /Hz at 1~kHz offset and ~dBrad /Hz at 100~kHz offset. The 4.596~GHz output signal is used as a local oscillator (LO) in a laboratory-prototype Cs microcell-based coherent population trapping (CPT) atomic clock. The signal is stabilized onto the atomic transition frequency by tuning finely a voltage-controlled phase shifter (VCPS) implemented in the 2.298~GHz HBAR-oscillator loop, preventing the need for a high-power-consuming direct digital synthesis (DDS). The short-term fractional frequency stability of the free-running oscillator is 1.8 10 at one second integration time. In locked regime, the latter is improved in a preliminary proof-of-concept experiment at the level of 6.6 10 up to a few seconds and found to be limited by the signal-to-noise ratio of the detected CPT resonance."

The daughter, Ba, has a 4 state at 2544.481(24) keV and a state at 2532.653(23) keV, both of which can potentially be ultralow -value end-states for the Cs decay. With our new ground-to-ground state value, the decay energies to these two states become -7.65(45) keV and 4.18(45) keV, respectively. The former is confirmed to be negative at the level of 17 , which verifies that this transition is not a suitable candidate for neutrino mass determination. On the other hand, the slightly negative value makes this transition an interesting candidate for the study of virtual - transitions. The decay to the 3 state is validated to have a positive low value which makes it a viable candidate for neutrino mass determination.

Particularly, transitions obeying an apparent selection rule, referred to as magnetically-induced (MI) transitions, have their probabilities largely increase in the intermediate interaction regime while being null at zero and higher magnetic fields. With an 800 nm-thick Cs vapor cell placed in a field up to 1.5 kG, we show here that the generation of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), realized in -systems involving MI transitions, is only possible when both the coupling and probe beams are -circular polarized, demonstrating that EIT is affected by magnetic circular dichroism. A similar rule of thumb can be extrapolated for MI transitions and polarization. Because of the high frequency shift slope (typ. 4 MHz/G), the generation of EIT resonances involving MI transitions is interesting, especially in the context of growing attention towards micro-machined alkali vapor cell sensors."

    "summary": "We report the design, synthesis, structure, and properties of two complex layered phosphide nitrides, Th Mn P N ( = Rb, Cs), which contain anti-fluorite-type [Mn P ] bilayers separated by fluorite-type [Th2N2] layers as a result of the intergrowth between AkMn P and ThMnPN. The new compounds are featured with an intrinsic hole doping associated with the interlayer charge transfer and a built-in chemical pressure from the [Th N ] layers, both of which are reflected by the changes in the lattice and the atomic position of phosphorus. The measurements of magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and specific heat indicate existence of local moments as well as itinerant electrons in relation with d-p hybridizations. The expected dominant antiferromagnetic interactions with enhanced d-p hybridizations were demonstrated by the first-principles calculations only when additional Coulomb repulsions are included. The density of states at the Fermi level derived from the specific-heat analysis are 3.5 and 7.5 times of the calculated ones for Ak = Rb and Cs, respectively, suggesting strong electron correlations in the title compounds."

    "title": "Temperature Dependence of Alkali-Metal Rattling Dynamics in the β-Pyrochlores, AOs2O6 (A = K, Rb, Cs), from MD Simulation",
    "summary": "We investigate the temperature response of the alkali-metal rattling modes in β-pyrochlores, AOs2O6 (A = K, Rb, Cs), from the results of ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed at 20 K, 100 K, and 300 K. Our results show that the temperature response of the T1u mode is clearly different from that of the T2g mode for all three pyrochlores. In this regard, two features are of particular note for both K and Rb; (1) the T1u mode exhibits a distinctly stronger softening response with decreasing temperature compared to the T2g mode, and (2) the T1u mode becomes stronger and sharper with decreasing temperature. These two findings suggest that the T1u mode is significantly more anharmonic and sensitive to the cage dynamics than the T2g mode. Examination of the local potentials around the alkali-metal atoms reveals that K has the flattest and most anharmonic potential at all temperatures while Cs exhibits the narrowest potential. The temperature dependence of the local potentials reveals that, for K, the potential at a higher temperature is not a simple extrapolation to higher energy of that at a lower temperature. Instead, we find significant reconstruction of the potential at different temperatures. Finally, we explore the temperature response of the coupling between the alkali metals and find a complex temperature dependence which suggests that the origin of the coupling may be more complex than a pure Coulomb interaction. We also find an unexpected increase in the static disorder of the system at low temperatures for the K and Rb pyrochlores."

Despite numerous recent studies, the interconnection of magnetism and other complex collective phenomena in these systems has yet not arrived at any conclusion. Using first-principles tools, we demonstrate that their electronic structures, complex fermiologies and phonon dispersions are strongly influenced by the interplay of dynamic electron correlations, non-trivial spin-polarization and spin-orbit coupling. An investigation of the first-principles-derived inter-site magnetic exchanges with the complementary analysis of q-dependence of the electronic response functions and the electron-phonon coupling indicate that the system conforms as a frustrated spin-cluster, where the occurrence of the charge-order phase is intimately related to the mechanism of electron-phonon coupling, rather than the Fermi-surface nesting."

Using angle-resolved photoemission we provide experimental evidence that these interactions can be drastically modified by adsorbate-induced alterations in the surface potential barrier. This, in turn, will cause significant changes in the ordering of the adsorbates. For the studied case example of Cs adatoms on Ag(111) our momentum-resolved measurements reveal the surface state Fermi wave vector to be increased by as much as 100% for coverages around 0.03 ML. Our results unravel the origin for the hitherto puzzling and unexpectedly small lattice constant in the adatom superlattice observed for this system."

In addition, we also obtain magic wavelengths using linearly polarized light, in order to verify the previously reported values, and make a comparative study with the values obtained for circularly polarized light. A number of these wavelengths are found to be in the optical region and could be of immense interest to experimentalists for carrying out high precision measurements. To obtain these wavelengths, we have calculated dynamic dipole polarizabilities of the ground, and states of Cs. We use the available precise values of the electric dipole (E1) matrix elements of the transitions that give the dominant contributions from the lifetime measurements of the excited states. Other significantly contributing E1 matrix elements are obtained by employing a relativistic coupled-cluster singles and doubles method. The accuracies of the dynamic polarizabilities are substantiated by comparing the static polarizability values with the corresponding experimental results."

The region covered by the G332.809-0.132 complex coincides with the RCW 103 stellar association. In its core (40' in radius), approximately 110 OB candidate stars (Ks < 10 mag and 0.4 < AKs < 1.6 mag) were identified using 2MASS, DENIS, and GLIMPSE data. This number of OB stars accounts for more than 50% of the observed number of Lyman continuum photons from this region. Medium-resolution K-band spectra were obtained for seven early types, including one WN 8 star and one Ofpe/WN 9 star; the latter is located near the RCW 103 remnant and its luminosity is consistent with a distance of about 3 kpc. The area analyzed encloses 9 of the 34 OB stars previously known in RCW 103, as well as IRAS 16115-5044, which we reclassify as a candidate luminous blue variable. The line of sight is particularly interesting, crossing three spiral arms; a molecular cloud at -50 (with RCW 103 in the Scutum-Crux arm) and another at -90 km s-1 (in the Norma arm) are detected, both rich in massive stars and supernova remnants. We also report the detection of a B supergiant as the main ionizing source of CS 78, 2MASS J17213513-3532415. Medium-resolution H and K band spectra display H I and He I lines, as well as Fe II lines. By assuming a distance of 1.35 kpc, we estimate a bolometric magnitude of -6.16, which is typical of supergiants."

A small fraction of extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars exhibit excesses of heavy neutron-capture elements produced in the r-process, and CS 31082-001 is among the 4 well-known r-process-enhanced EMP stars. Observations with HST/STIS provide abundances for elements observable only from the UV region. Here we aim to supplement the optical data with abundances from near-UV spectroscopy of the first and second peak of the r-elements, which are crucial to giving insight into the nucleosynthesis of the elements beyond iron. The UVES spectrum provided additional measurements, thereby improving the previous results. The spectra were analyzed with the OSMARCS LTE model atmosphere and with a consistent approach based on the spectrum synthesis code Turbospectrum to derive abundances of heavy elements in CS 31082-001, using updated oscillator strengths from the recent literature. We computed synthetic spectra for all lines of the elements of interest, checking for proper intensities and possible blends. We combined the abundances of heavy elements derived in previous works with the derivation of abundances from all reliable new list of lines, for the first and second peaks of r-elements. We were able to derive new abundances for 23 n-elements, 6 of them - Ge, Mo, Lu, Ta, W, and Re - were not available in previous works, making this star the most complete r-II object studied, with a total of 37 detections of n-capture elements.

While KV3Sb5 and RbV3Sb5 exhibit pressure-insensitive interaction parameters, CsV3Sb5 manifests anomalous discontinuities in and near GPa, suggesting a first-order electronic phase transition.

To explore the intricate interplay between the superconducting and charge orders, we investigate the doping evolution of superconductivity, charge-density-wave (CDW) order, and band topology in doped topological kagome superconductors Cs(V Ti ) Sb where the Ti-dopant introduces hole-like charge carriers. Despite the absence of the CDW phase transition in doped compounds even for the lowest doping level of , the superconductivity survives in all doped samples with enhanced critical temperatures. The high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements reveal that the Ti-dopant in the kagome plane lowers the chemical potential, pushing the van Hove singularity (VHS) at point above the Fermi level. First-principle simulations corroborate the doping evolution of the band structure observed in ARPES, and affirm that the CDW instability does not occur once the VHS is pushed above the Fermi level, explaining the absence of the CDW ordering in our doped samples Cs(V Ti ) Sb . Our results demonstrate a competition between the CDW and superconducting orders in the kagome-metal superconductor CsV Sb , although the superconductivity is likely inconsequential of the CDW order."

Implementation of ANN algorithms in electrical, and electronics engineering always satisfies with the expected results as ANN handles binary data more accurately. Brushless Direct Current motor (BLDC motor) uses electronic closed-loop controllers to switch DC current to the motor windings and produces the magnetic fields. The BLDC motor finds various applications owing to its high speed, low maintenance and adequate torque capability. They are highly preferred than the other motors because of their better performance and it is easy to control their speed by Power Converters. This article presents a method of speed control of BLDC motors where speed is controlled by changing the DC input voltage of the bridge converter that feeds the motor winding. The control is done by using a PI based speed controller. The motor is modeled in the MATLAB/Simulink and the speed control is obtained with a PI controller. EMF signals, rotor speed, electromagnetic torque, Hall Effect signals, PWM and EMF signals simulations are then obtained. This acquired data is then fed into binary artificial neural networks and as a result, the ANN model predicts the corresponding parameters close to the simulation results.

The long wavelength dust continuum is used to estimate ISM masses for Arp 220 East, West and NGC 6240 of 1.9, 4.2 and 1.6x10^9 msun within radii of 69, 65 and 190 pc. The HCN emission was modeled to derive the emissivity distribution as a function of radius and the kinematics of each nuclear disk, yielding dynamical masses consistent with the masses and sizes derived from the dust emission. In Arp 220, the major dust and gas concentrations are at radii less than 50 pc in both counter-rotating nuclear disks. The thickness of the disks in Arp 220estimated from the velocity dispersion and rotation velocities are 10-20 pc and the mean gas densities are n_H2 ~10^5 cm^-3 at R < 50 pc. We develop an analytic treatment for the molecular excitation (including photon trapping), yielding volume densities for both the HCN and CS emission with n_H2 ~2x10^5 cm^-3. The agreement of the mean density from the total mass and size with that required for excitation suggests that the volume is essentially filled with dense gas, i.e. it is not cloudy or like swiss cheese."

The analysis is based on high-quality VLT/UVES spectra and MARCS model atmospheres. We detect lines of 15 heavy elements in the spectrum of CS 29491-069, and 18 in HE 1219-0312; in both cases including the Th II 4019 Å line. The heavy-element abundance patterns of these two stars are mostly well-matched to scaled solar residual abundances not formed by the s-process. We also compare the observed pattern with recent high-entropy wind (HEW) calculations, which assume core-collapse supernovae of massive stars as the astrophysical environment for the r-process, and find good agreement for most lanthanides. The abundance ratios of the lighter elements strontium, yttrium, and zirconium, which are presumably not formed by the main r-process, are reproduced well by the model. Radioactive dating for CS 29491-069 with the observed thorium and rare-earth element abundance pairs results in an average age of 9.5 Gyr, when based on solar r-process residuals, and 17.6 Gyr, when using HEW model predictions. Chronometry seems to fail in the case of HE 1219-0312, resulting in a negative age due to its high thorium abundance. HE 1219-0312 could therefore exhibit an overabundance of the heaviest elements, which is sometimes called an \"actinide boost\"."

Firstly, explicit multi-hypothesis motion compensation is applied in our network to extract correlation information of adjacent frames(as shown in Fig. 1), which improves the recover performance. And then, a residual module further narrows down the gap between reconstruction result and original signal. The overall architecture is interpretable by using algorithm unrolling, which brings the benefits of being able to transfer prior knowledge about the conventional algorithms. As a result, a PSNR of 22dB can be achieved at 64x compression ratio, which is about 4% to 9% better than state-of-the-art methods. In addition, due to the feed-forward architecture, the reconstruction can be processed by our network in real time and up to three orders of magnitude faster than traditional iterative methods."

Three-step resonant photoionization was implemented via two intermediate states (6P3/2 pumped with 852 nm laser and 7S1/2 with 1470 nm) and a tuneable femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser for the final ionization step. The magnetic field of the MOT is switched off during the photoionization step. The natural bandwidth of the fs-laser is reduced to 4 meV using optical spectral filters. Precise tuning of the photon energy makes it possible to observe the transition regime between direct photoemission into the open continuum and field induced ionization of highly-excited Rydberg states. The paths can be identified by their characteristic dependency on the extraction field and on the Ti:sapphire polarization. ToF analysis allowed us to disentangle the ionization paths and the dependence of the spatio-temporal distribution of the cold electrons on the polarization of the ionizing laser."

The wavepacket of the rescattered electron destructively interferes with the anti-bonding -orbital of CS such that rescattering is effectively \"switched off\". Direct signature of enhanced ionization being \"switched off\" in the ultrashort domain is also obtained. Consequently, dissociation becomes an almost non-existent channel when few-cycle pulses are used, with only long-lived singly-, doubly-, and triply-charged molecular ions dominating the mass spectrum. Few-cycle optical pulses help reveal that quantum-mechanically determined molecular symmetry contributes to strong field molecular ionization."

We have carried out multi-transitional observations and analyses of three dense gas molecular tracers, CS, HC3N and CH3CCH, using Boltzmann diagrams in order to determine the rotational temperatures and column densities of the dense gas, and using a Large Velocity Gradients model to calculate the H2 density structure in the molecular clouds. The CS and HC3N data indicate the presence of density gradients in the molecular clouds, showing similar excitation conditions, and suggesting that they arise from the same gas components. In M82, CH3CCH has the highest fractional abundance determined in a extragalactic source (10^-8). The density and the chemical gradients found in all galaxies can be explained in the framework of the starburst evolution. The young shock-dominatedstarburst galaxies, like presumably Maffei2, show a cloud structure with a rather uniform density and chemical composition which suggests low star formation activity. Molecular clouds in galaxies with starburst in an intermediate stage of evolution, such as NGC253 and IC342, show clouds with a large density contrast (two orders of magnitude) between the denser regions (cores) and the less dense regions (halos) of the molecular clouds and relatively constant chemical abundance. Finally, the galaxy with the most evolved starburst, M82, has clouds with a rather uniform density structure, large envelopes of atomic/molecular gas subjected to UV photodissociating radiation from young star clusters, and very different chemical abundances of HC3N and CH3CCH."

The quinary inorganic compounds crystallize in a body-centered tetragonal lattice with space group I4/mmm, which contain double Fe As layers that are separated by insulating Ca F layers.

    "summary": "We present a high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of the extremely-metal-poor star CS 22957-027, which Beers et al (1992) noted to exhibit a rather strong G-band. For Teff = 4839 K, derived from broadband photometry, our analysis obtains log g = 2.25, and a very low metallicity of [Fe/H]=-3.43 +/- 0.12. The carbon-to-iron ratio is found to be enhanced by about 2 dex relative to the solar value, similar to the handful of other carbon-rich metal-deficient stars discussed by Norris et al (1997a) and Barbuy et al (1997). From the 12C13C (1,0) Swan bandhead and 13CH lines the isotope ratio 12C/13C is about 10, indicating a 13C enrichment. Nitrogen is also found to be enhanced by about 1 dex. The s-process elements Sr and Ba are, surprisingly, found to be under-abundant relative to solar, with [Sr/Fe]=-0.91 and [Ba/Fe]=-0.93. The star's low luminosity requires that the chemical enrichment arises from mass transfer from an evolved companion, rather than self-polluting dredge-up processes. However, the s-process elements Sr and Ba are unusually low, with a solar ratio to one another, at variance with what found in the ``classical'' CH stars. Finally we note that a feature due to 13CH is present in coincidence with the Th II 401.9129 nm resonance line. The blend is of relevance for the nucleo-chronology use of the Th II line in these extremely metal poor stars, when significant 13C is present."

Many theoretical interpretations have been devoted to this issue. Most of authors suggest that they are not the conventional quark model states, but possibly are four-quark states, molecule states or mixtures of a P-wave and a four-quark state. In this work, we follow the four-quark-state picture, and study the masses of states ( is or quark) in the chiral SU(3) quark model. The numerical results show that the mass of the mixed four-quark state ( ) with spin parity might not be .

Cold cesium D atoms, prepared via two-photon laser excitation, are probed by scanning weak microwave fields interacting with the atoms across the resonances. Transition spectra are acquired using state-selective electric-field ionization and time-gated ion detection.

A comprehensive analysis of relevant line-shift uncertainties and line-broadening effects is conducted. We find quantum defect parameters and , as well as and , for and , respectively. Fine structure parameters and for Cs are also obtained. Results are discussed in context with previous works, and the significance of the results is discussed."

We use Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) coupled with non-empirical hybrid functionals, specifically PBE0( ) and dielectric-dependent hybrids (DDH) to explore direct, indirect, and self-trapped excitons in this material. Based on comparison with experiment, we show that these methods can give excellent prediction of the absorption spectrum and that the fundamental band gap has been underestimated in previous computational studies. We connect the experimental photoluminescence signals at 1.9-2.0 eV to the emission from self-trapped excitons and electron polarons. Finally, we reveal a complex landscape with energetically competing direct, indirect, and self-trapped excitons in the material."

From there, the charge order forming below T can unfold into a variety of phases capable of exhibiting orbital currents and nematicity.

    "summary": "The chemical composition of planets is inherited by the distribution of the various molecular species in the protoplanetary disk at thetime of their formation. As of today, only a handful of disks has been imaged in multiple spectral lines with high spatial resolution. As part of a small campaign devoted to the chemical characterization of disk-outflow sources in Taurus, we report on new ALMA Band 6 observations with 20 au resolution toward the embedded young star DG Tau B. Images of the continuum emission reveals a dust disk with rings and, putatively, a leading spiral arm. The disk, as well as the prominent outflow cavities, are detected in CO, H2CO, CS, and CN while they remain undetected in SO2, HDO, and CH3OH. From the absorption of the back-side outflow, we inferred that the disk emission is optically thick in the inner 50 au. This morphology explains why no line emission is detected from this inner region and poses some limitations toward the calculation of the dust mass and the characterization of the inner gaseous disk. The H2CO and CS emission from the inner 200 au is mostly from the disk and their morphology is very similar. The CN emission significantly differs from the other two molecules as it is observed only beyond 150 au. This ring-like morphology is consistent with previous observations and the predictions of thermochemical disk models. Finally, we constrained the disk-integrated column density of all molecules. In particular, we found that the CH3OH/H2CO ratio must be smaller than 2, making the methanol non-detection still consistent with the only such a ratio available from the literature (1.27 in TW Hya)."

For nearby galaxies with large radii, we measure the IR luminosity within the submm beam-size (14\"-18\") to match the molecular emission. We find linear slopes for L_CS76-L_IR and L_HCN43-L_IR, and a slightly super-linear slope for L_HCO+43-L_IR. The correlation of L_CS76-L_IR even extends over eight orders of luminosity magnitude down to Galactic dense cores, with a fit of log(L_IR)=1.00( 0.01) log(L_CS76) + 4.03( 0.04).

    "summary": "The ability to spatially resolve the carrier mobility profile along the cross section of micrometer-thin solar cells is vital both for fundamental studies in photovoltaics and as a quality control for reproducibly obtaining high conversion efficiencies in commercial solar cell modules. Presently, no technique capable of such an endeavor is available to the best of our knowledge. Here, we introduce a novel method capable of profiling the carrier mobility along the z-axis in thin-film photovoltaics. Our setup is based on the integration of photogenerated charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (p-CELIV) with a scanning confocal optical microscope (SCOM) towards a cross-sectional sensitive p-CELIV (cs-p-CELIV) system. As geminate recombination of excess carriers is the most frequent radiative pathway for electrons and holes in solar cells at low power density of illumination, while nongeminate recombination dominates at high power, enhanced nongeminate recombination occurs at the SCOM focal plane. Thus, the cs-p-CELIV signal provides enhanced information on the mobility of all of the cross-sectional layers, except for the focal plane. By scanning the focal plane along the z-axis, the mobility profile can be derived. To demonstrate our technique, we use it to investigate the carrier mobility in a hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cell. The mobility profile obtained by cs-p-CELIV correlates well with the H content profile, measured independently, and is in excellent agreement with models suggesting a critical role of Si-H bonding in locally determining the carrier mobility in a-Si:H."

As a result, studying these halides could be useful for optoelectronic and solar cell applications. In this study, we investigated the structural, mechanical, thermodynamic, electronic, and optical properties of A2AgIrCl6 (A = Cs, Rb, K) double perovskite halides using density functional theory calculations with the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave (FP-LAPW) approach, aiming to evaluate their suitability for renewable energy devices. The Goldsmith tolerance factor, octahedral factor, and new tolerance factor have confirmed the cubic stability of the predicted compounds. We have also verified the thermodynamic stability of these compounds by calculating the formation enthalpy, binding energy, and phonon dispersion curves. Additionally, Born-Huang stability requirements on stiffness constants confirmed the mechanical stability of the titled compounds. To predict the accurate optoelectronic properties, we employed the TB-mBJ potential.

Furthermore, the optical properties of A2AgIrCl6 (A = Cs, Rb, K) compounds demonstrated very low reflectivity and excellent light absorption coefficients (105 cm-1) in the visible light spectrum, suggesting their suitability as an absorbing layer in solar cells.

The impact of several experimental parameters onto the clock resonance and short-term fractional frequency stability, including the laser power, the cell temperature and the Ramsey sequence parameters, has been investigated. We observe and explain the existence of a slight dependence on laser power of the central Ramsey-CPT fringe line-width in the pulsed regime. We report also that the central fringe line-width is commonly narrower than the expected Ramsey line-width given by , with the free-evolution time, for short values of . The clock demonstrates a short-term fractional frequency stability at the level of up to 100 seconds averaging time, mainly limited by the laser AM noise. Comparable performances are obtained in the conventional continuous (CW) regime, if use of an additional laser power stabilization setup. The pulsed interaction allows to reduce significantly the clock frequency sensitivity to laser power variations, especially for high values of . This pulsed CPT clock, ranking among the best microwave vapor cell atomic frequency standards, could find applications in telecommunication, instrumentation, defense or satellite-based navigation systems."

We thus investigate the feasibility of using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) to implement a model-independent measurement protocol for entanglement based on three entanglement witnesses: one-tangle, two-tangle, and quantum Fisher information (QFI). We perform high-resolution INS measurements on Cs CoCl , a close realization of the transverse-field XXZ spin chain, where we can control entanglement using the magnetic field, and compare with density-matrix renormalization group calculations for validation. The three witnesses allow us to infer entanglement properties and make deductions about the quantum state in the material. We find QFI to be a particularly robust experimental probe of entanglement, whereas the one- and two-tangles require more careful analysis. Our results lay the foundation for a general entanglement detection protocol for quantum spin systems."

However, only the K, Rb, and Cs compounds exhibit thermodynamic stability below 50 GPa, while NaB C remains thermodynamically unstable at all pressures considered. Based on the Allen and Dynes modified McMillan equation, we predict the superconducting transition temperature of these compounds to be over 65 K at ambient pressure, with decreasing under higher pressures. Remarkably, we find CsB C possesses the highest predicted of 68.76 K. Our findings demonstrate the possibility of high temperature superconductivity in cubic MB C at ambient pressure, expanding the B-C clathrate superconductor family.

Ensuring scalability of automated image captioning systems with respect to the ever increasing volume of image and video data is a significant challenge. This paper provides a valuable insight in that the detection of a few significant (top) objects in an image allows one to extract other relevant information such as actions (verbs) in the image. We expect this insight to be useful in the design of scalable image captioning systems. We address two parameters by which the scalability of image captioning systems could be quantified, i.e., the traditional algorithmic time complexity which is important given the resource limitations of the user device and the system development time since the programmers' time is a critical resource constraint in many real-world scenarios. Additionally, we address the issue of how word embeddings could be used to infer the verb (action) from the nouns (objects) in a given image in a zero-shot manner. Our results show that it is possible to attain reasonably good performance on predicting actions and captioning images using our approaches with the added advantage of simplicity of implementation."

Actually, the atmospheric deposition onto the ground may be studied through the map of measured Cs-137 established consecutively to the accident. The limits of detection were low enough to make the measurements possible as far as 250km from the nuclear power plant. This large scale deposition has been modelled with the Eulerian model ldX. However, several weeks of emissions in multiple weather conditions make it a real challenge. Besides, these measurements are accumulated deposition of Cs-137 over the whole period and do not inform of deposition mechanisms involved: in-cloud, below-cloud, dry deposition. In a previous study (Qu é rel et al., 2016), a comprehensive sensitivity analysis was performed in order to understand wet deposition mechanisms. It has been shown that the choice of the wet deposition scheme has a strong impact on assessment of deposition patterns. Nevertheless, a ``best'' scheme could not be highlighted as it depends on the selected criteria: the ranking differs according to the statistical indicators considered (correlation, figure of merit in space and factor 2). A possibility to explain the difficulty to discriminate between several schemes was the uncertainties in the modelling, resulting from the meteorological data for instance. Since the move of the plume is not properly modelled, the deposition processes are applied with an inaccurate activity concentration in the air. In the framework of the SAKURA project, an MRI-IRSN collaboration, new meteorological fields at higher resolution (Sekiyama et al., 2013) were provided and allow to reconsider the previous study. An update including these new meteorology data is presented. In addition, the focus is put on the deposition schemes commonly used in nuclear emergency context."

As an interesting candidate to accommodate light Higgs, in this paper we adopt the scenario of dimensional deconstruction, where Higgs is redarded as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson. Though the scenario is formulated in ordinary 4-dimensional space-time, it may also be interpreted as \"latticized\" gauge-Higgs unification. We point out that in this scenario Higgs interaction with matter field is anomalous, i.e. its coupling deviates from what the standard model predicts. The interplay between the periodicity of physical observables in the Higgs field and the violation of translational invariance along the extra-space due to the latticization is argued to play an essential role to get the anomalous interaction. Though the predicted anomalous Higgs interaction has much similarity to the one in the gauge-Higgs unification, in the case of dimensional deconstruction the anomaly exists even if we do not introduce bulk mass term for the chiral fermion realized by orbifolding, in clear contrast to the case of gauge-Higgs unification. It in turn means that the anomaly goes away in the continuum limit of the extra-space."

Measurements of the polarization-dependent two-photon excitation spectrum associated with the transition were made in an approximately 200 cm-1 range on the low frequency side of the 6s 2S1/2 - 6p 2P3/2 resonance. The measurements depend parametrically on the relative transition matrix elements, but also are sensitive to far-off-resonance 6s 2S1/2 - np 2Pj - 8s 2S1/2 transitions. In the past, this dependence has yielded a generalized sum rule, the value of which is dependent on sums of relative two-photon transition matrix elements.

    "summary": "There have been extended and heated discussions on the nature of the two exotic states, and , particularly whether they are near-threshold resonances, virtual states, or bound states. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that the femtoscopic technique can be employed to distinguish between these three scenarios. More concretely, based on the Koonin-Pratt formula with a Gaussian source, we show that the low-momentum / correlation functions significantly differ in the three scenarios. The high-momentum results exhibit distinct characteristics in the resonant and virtual state scenarios, especially in small collision systems of 1 fm, as produced in collisions at the LHC. We hope that these discoveries will stimulate further experimental studies and help clarify the nature of the many exotic states that have been discovered."

    "summary": "Pb-based compounds have garnered considerable theoretical and experimental attention due to their promising potential in energy-related applications. In this study, we explore the glass-like alkali metal lead oxides X PbO (X=Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) and assess their suitability for piezoelectric and thermoelectric applications. First-principles calculations were performed using hybrid density functional theory (DFT), incorporating B3LYP, HSE06, and PBE0 functionals. Among these, PBE0 is identified as the most accurate, yielding lattice parameters in close agreement with experimental data. Structural stability was confirmed through evaluation of thermal, mechanical, and formation energies. For the non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic phase Cmc2 -X PbO (X=K, Rb, Cs), piezoelectric constants were computed via both the numerical Berry phase (BP) method and the analytical Coupled Perturbed Hartree-Fock/Kohn-Sham (CPHF/KS) formalism. Notably, Cs PbO exhibited a piezoelectric coefficient of e = 0.60 C m (CPHF/KS), while K PbO showed e = -0.51 C m (BP). Thermoelectric properties were investigated using the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory within the rigid band approximation. The calculated thermoelectric performance reveals promising figures of merit (ZT), ranging from 0.3 to 0.63, suggesting these materials are applicable as future thermoelectric materials."

    "summary": "Today, more and more embedded devices are being connected through a network, generally Internet, offering users different services. This concept refers to Internet of Things (IoT), bringing information and control capabilities in many fields like medicine, smart homes, home security, etc. Main drawbacks of IoT environment are its dependency on Internet connectivity and need continuous devices power. These dependencies may affect system performances, namely request processing response times. In this context, we propose in this paper a continuous performance monitoring methodology, applied on IoT systems based on Publish/subscribe communication model. Our approach assesses performances using Stochastic Petri net modeling, and self-optimizes whenever poor performances are detected. Our approach relies on a Stochastic Petri nets modelling and analysis to assess performances. We target improving performances, in particular response times, by online modification of influencing factors."

The use of chemical models of the evolution of the molecular gas provides a way to probe the physical properties of the clouds. We study the properties of the clump and inter-clump medium in the starless CS core in LDN 673 by carrying out a molecular line survey with the IRAM 30-m telescope toward two clumps and two inter-clump positions. We also observed the 1.2-mm continuum with the MAMBO-II bolometer at IRAM. The dust continuum map shows four condensations, three of them centrally peaked, coinciding with previously identified sub-millimetre sources. We confirm that the denser clump of the region, , is also the more chemically evolved, and it could still undergo further fragmentation. The inter-clump medium positions are denser than previously expected, likely --1 \\ due to contamination, and are chemically young, similar to the gas in the lower density clump position. We argue that the density contrast between these positions and their general young chemical age would support the existence of transient clumps in the lower density material of the core. We were also able to find reasonable fits of the observationally derived chemical abundances to models of the chemistry of transient clumps."

These comprehensive guides evolved from the consideration of various personalized behavioral factors. Nevertheless, existing approaches frequently neglect the users dynamic behavior and the changing in their health conditions. This study aims to fill this gap by developing a machine learning algorithm that dynamically updates auto-suggestion exercise goals using retrospective data and realistic behavior trajectory. We conducted a methodological study by designing a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to evaluate exercise performance, considering fitness-fatigue effects. The deep reinforcement learning algorithm combines deep learning techniques to analyse time series data and infer user exercise behavior. In addition, we use the asynchronous advantage actor-critic algorithm for reinforcement learning to determine the optimal exercise intensity through exploration and exploitation. The personalized exercise data and biometric data used in this study were collected from publicly available datasets, encompassing walking, sports logs, and running. In our study, we conducted The statistical analyses/inferential tests to compare the effectiveness of machine learning approach in exercise goal setting across different exercise goal setting strategies."

Further investigation of its dielectric response, optical properties and structural stability is thus warranted. Cs AgBiBr exhibits a well-documented structural phase transition at 120 K but indications for an additional lower temperature ( 40 K) phase transition have also been reported. On the basis of measurements of the specific heat capacity, temperature dependent powder X-ray diffraction, low frequency capacitance, and infrared reflectivity we clarify the previously reported splitting of phonon modes in the Raman spectrum at 40 K as due to a subtle structural phase transition from the tetragonal I4/m structure to a monoclinic / crystal structure. The infrared active vibrational modes are experimentally investigated in the three structural regimes. In the cubic structure at room temperature the four IR active modes are observed at 135, 95, 55, and 25 cm , as the symmetry reduces to tetragonal a minute splitting of these modes is expected, however below 40 K an additional mode is observed indicating a further reduction in symmetry."

Our ZF SR measurements reveal the presence of spin fluctuations below 4 K and the ZF relaxation rate ( ) shows enhancement below 2.1 K, which might indicate that the superconducting state is unconventional. This observation suggests that the electrons are paired via unconventional channels such as spin fluctuations, as proposed on the basis of theoretical models. Our analysis of the TF SR results shows that the temperature dependence of the superfluid density is fitted better with a nodal gap structure than an isotropic s-wave model for the superconducting gap. The observation of a nodal gap in Cs Cr As is consistent with that observed in the isostructural K Cr As compound through TF SR measurements. Furthermore, from our TF SR study we have estimated the magnetic penetration depth = 954 nm, superconducting carrier density m , and carrier's effective-mass enhancement = 1.61m ."

    "summary": "We observed 146 Galactic clumps in HCN (4-3) and CS (7-6) with the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) 10-m telescope. A tight linear relationship between star formation rate and gas mass traced by dust continuum emission was found for both Galactic clumps and the high redshift (z>1) star forming galaxies (SFGs), indicating a constant gas depletion time of ~100 Myr for molecular gas in both Galactic clumps and high z SFGs. However, low z galaxies do not follow this relation and seem to have a longer global gas depletion time. The correlations between total infrared luminosities (L_TIR) and molecular line luminosities (L'_mol) of HCN (4-3) and CS (7-6) are tight and sublinear extending down to clumps with LTIR~10^ 3 L_sun. These correlations become linear when extended to external galaxies. A bimodal behavior in the LTIR--L'mol correlations was found for clumps with different dust temperature, luminosity-to-mass ratio, and sigmaline/sigmavir. Such bimodal behavior may be due to evolutionary effects. The slopes of LTIR--L'mol correlations become more shallow as clumps evolve. We compared our results with lower J transition lines in wu et al. (2010). The correlations between clump masses and line luminosities are close to linear for low effective excitation density tracers but become sublinear for high effective excitation density tracers for clumps with LTIR larger than LTIR~10^4.5 Lsun. High effective excitation density tracers cannot linearly trace the total clump masses, leading to a sublinear correlations for both Mclump-L'mol and LTIR-L'mol relations."

The parent compounds of cuprate superconductors are Mott insulators with strong in-plane antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between Cu moments. Here we show, based on first-principles density functional calculations, that AFeSe2 (A=Tl, K, Rb, or Cs) exhibit many of the physical properties common to the cuprate parent compounds: (1) the FeSe2 layer in AFeSe2 is similar in crystalline and electronic structures to the CuO2 plane in cuprates, although Se atoms are not coplanar to the square Fe-lattice; (2) they are antiferromagnetic insulators, but with relatively small charge excitation gaps; (3) their ground states are Neel antiferromagnetic ordered, similar as in cuprates; and (4) the antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between Fe moments are larger than in other iron-based superconducting materials, but comparable to those in cuprates. Like cuprates, these compounds may become high-Tc superconductors upon doping of charge carriers either by chemical substitution or intercalation or by liquid or solid gating."

Results: We detected HCO+ along 72 of 86 sightlines where it was observed, C2H along 53 of 76 sightlines and HCN along 38 of 57 sightlines. C2H is ubiquitous and N(C2H)/N(HCO+) increases at smaller EB-V and smaller N(HCO+) but C2H absorption is intrinsically weaker, decreasing the number of sightlines with low column density along which it was detected.The dense-gas tracer HCN was uniformly detected down to N(H2) = 10^20 cm-2 with little change in the relative abundance N(HCN)/N(HCO+) = 1.25. HCO was detected along only 4 of 46 sight lines that were newly observed at ALMA because its lines are intrinsically weak, but HCO is ubiquitous in the interstellar medium with N(HCO)/N(HCO+) = 1/3 or N(HCO)/N(H2) = 10^-9.

We also demonstrate contributions explicitly from the Dirac-Coulomb interactions, frequency independent Breit interaction and lower order quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects. Uncertainties to these matrix elements due to different possible sources of errors are estimated. By combining our calculated radiative matrix elements with the experimental values of the transition wavelengths, we obtain the transition probabilities due to both the allowed and lower order forbidden channels. Adding these quantities together, the lifetimes of the above two states are determined precisely and plausible reasons for the reported inconsistencies between the earlier theoretical calculations and the experimental results have been pointed out."

We attribute the splittings to the spin-spin and spin-rotation couplings by modelling the observation using a full coupled-channel calculation. Comparison with an oversimplified model, estimating the spin-rotation coupling by describing the weakly bound close-channel molecular state with the perturbative multipole expansion, reveals the significant contribution of the molecular wavefunction at short internuclear distances. Our findings highlight the potential of Feshbach resonances in providing precise information on short- and intermediate-range molecular couplings and wavefunctions.

We report the first tentative detection of methanol (CH OH) in a Class I disk and resolve, for the first time, the vertical structure of a disk with multiple molecular tracers. The bulk of the emission in the CO 2-1, CS 5-4, and o-H CO 3(1,2)-2(1,1) lines originates from the warm molecular layer, with the line intensity peaking at increasing disk heights, , for increasing radial distances, . Molecular emission is vertically stratified, with CO observed at larger disk heights (aperture ) compared to both CS and H CO, which are nearly cospatial ( ). In the outer midplane, the line emission decreases due to molecular freeze-out onto dust grains (freeze-out layer) by a factor of >100 (CO) and 15 (CS). The H CO emission decreases by a factor of only about 2, which is possibly due to H CO formation on icy grains, followed by a nonthermal release into the gas phase. The inferred [CH OH]/[H CO] abundance ratio is 0.5-0.6, which is 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than for Class 0 hot corinos, and a factor ~2.5 lower than the only other value inferred for a protoplanetary disk (in TW Hya, 1.3-1.7). Additionally, it is at the lower edge but still consistent with the values in comets. This may indicate that some chemical reprocessing occurs in disks before the formation of planets and comets."

FastJAM leverages pairwise matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss, that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality, while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds. Our code is available at our project webpage, https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/FastJAM/"

    "summary": "Comparing high-resolution specific heat and thermal expansion measurements to exact finite-size diagonalization, we demonstrate that Cs CoCl for a magnetic field along the crystallographic b axis realizes the spin- XXZ chain in a transverse field. Exploiting both thermal as well as virtual excitations of higher crystal field states, we find that the spin chain is in the XY-limit with an anisotropy substantially smaller than previously believed. A spin-flop Ising quantum phase transition occurs at a critical field of T before around 3.5 T the description in terms of an effective spin- chain becomes inapplicable."

    "summary": "In the vicinity of a narrow Feshbach resonances Efimov features are expected to be characterized by the resonance's properties rather than the van der Waals length of the interatomic potential. Although this theoretical prediction is well-established by now, it still lacks experimental confirmation. Here, we apply our recently developed three-channel model [Yudkin and Khaykovich, Phys. Rev. A 103, 063303 (2021)] to the experimental result obtained in a mass-imbalanced Li- Cs mixture in the vicinity of the narrowest resonance explored to date [Johansen at. al. Nat. Phys. 13, 731 (2017)]. We confirm that the observed position of the Efimov resonance is dictated mainly by the resonance physics while the influence of the van der Waals tail of the interatomic potential is minor. We show that the resonance position is strongly influenced by the presence of another Feshbach resonance which significantly alters the effective background scattering length at the narrow resonance position."

    "title": "Pressure-tuning the quantum spin Hamiltonian of the triangular lattice antiferromagnet Cs$_2$CuCl$_4$",
    "summary": "Quantum triangular-lattice antiferromagnets are important prototype systems to investigate phenomena of the geometrical frustration in condensed matter. Apart from highly unusual magnetic properties, they possess a rich phase diagram (ranging from an unfrustrated square lattice to a quantum spin liquid), yet to be confirmed experimentally. One major obstacle in this area of research is the lack of materials with appropriate (ideally tuned) magnetic parameters. Using Cs CuCl as a model system, we demonstrate an alternative approach, where, instead of the chemical composition, the spin Hamiltonian is altered by hydrostatic pressure. The approach combines high-pressure electron spin resonance and magnetization measurements, allowing us not only to quasi-continuously tune the exchange parameters, but also to accurately monitor them. Our experiments indicate a substantial increase of the exchange coupling ratio from 0.3 to 0.42 at a pressure of 1.8 GPa, revealing a number of emergent field-induced phases."

    "summary": "To assess the potential optoelectronic applications of metal-halide perovskites, it is critical to have a detailed understanding of the nature, strength, and dynamics of the interactions between carriers and the polar lattices. Here, we report the electronic and structural dynamics of bismuth-based perovskite revealed by transient reflectivity and ultrafast electron diffraction. A cross-examination of these experimental results combined with theoretical analyses allows the identification of the major carrier-phonon coupling mechanism and the associated time scales. It is found that carriers photoinjected into form self-trapped excitons on an ultrafast time scale. However, they retain most of their energy and their coupling to Fröhlich-type optical phonons is limited at early times. Instead, the long-lived excitons exert an electronic stress via deformation potential and develop a prominent, sustaining strain field as coherent acoustic phonons in 10 ps. From sub-ps to ns and beyond, a similar extent of the atomic displacements is found throughout the different stages of structural distortions, from limited local modulations to a coherent strain field to the Debye-Waller random atomic motions on longer times. The current results suggest the potential use of bismuth-based perovskites for applications other than photovoltaics to take advantage of carriers' stronger self-trapping and long lifetime."

We identify shortcomings of using a tree method to implement Isolation Similarity; and propose a nearest neighbour method instead. We formally prove the characteristic of Isolation Similarity with the use of the proposed method. The impact of Isolation Similarity on density-based clustering is studied here. We show for the first time that the clustering performance of the classic density-based clustering algorithm DBSCAN can be significantly uplifted to surpass that of the recent density-peak clustering algorithm DP. This is achieved by simply replacing the distance measure with the proposed nearest-neighbour-induced Isolation Similarity in DBSCAN, leaving the rest of the procedure unchanged. A new type of clusters called mass-connected clusters is formally defined. We show that DBSCAN, which detects density-connected clusters, becomes one which detects mass-connected clusters, when the distance measure is replaced with the proposed similarity. We also provide the condition under which mass-connected clusters can be detected, while density-connected clusters cannot."

The geometry of the crystal structure allows the realization of chiral phonons, which are associated with the circulation of atoms around their equilibrium positions. Due to the inversion symmetry and time reversal symmetry, total pseudo-angular momentum (PAM) of the system vanishes. We show that the doping of these system can lead to a new phase with symmetry F m. New systems (KRbBi and RbCsBi ) do not exhibit soft modes (are stable dynamically). Due to the inversion symmetry breaking, realized chiral phonon modes posses a non-zero total PAM. In both type of systems the chiral phonons are realized for the wavectors at the edge of the Brillouine zone. This study explores the possibility of chiral phonon engineering via doping, and predicts two new materials. Discussing the problem opens a new way to study the phonon Hall effect."

Upon Nb doping, the charge-density wave (CDW) transition temperature is suppressed, and the superconducting temperature rises. The residual resistivity ratio decreases with Nb doping, suggesting an increase of disorder. For all compounds, the optical conductivity in the pristine phase reveals two Drude components (D1 and D2). The substitution of Nb causes an increase of D1 alongside a reduction of D2 in weight, which implies a change of the Fermi surface. The total Drude weight is reduced with increasing Nb content, signifying an enhancement of electronic correlations. Below , while the optical conductivity clearly manifests the CDW gap in all materials, the gapped portion of the Fermi surface shrinks as the Nb content grows. A comprehensive analysis indicates that the change of the Fermi surface, the enhancement of electronic correlations, the shrinkage of the removed Fermi surface by the CDW gap, and the increase of disorder may all have a considerable impact on the interplay between the CDW and superconductivity in Cs(V Nb ) Sb ."

The existence of a magnetic resonance in the spectrum of Rb(x)Fe(2-y)Se2 and now of Cs(x)Fe(2-y)Se2 suggests that this is a common feature of superconductivity in this family.

    "title": "Online Semi-Supervised Concept Drift Detection with Density Estimation",
    "summary": "Concept drift is formally defined as the change in joint distribution of a set of input variables X and a target variable y. The two types of drift that are extensively studied are real drift and virtual drift where the former is the change in posterior probabilities p(y|X) while the latter is the change in distribution of X without affecting the posterior probabilities. Many approaches on concept drift detection either assume full availability of data labels, y or handle only the virtual drift. In a streaming environment, the assumption of full availability of data labels, y is questioned. On the other hand, approaches that deal with virtual drift failed to address real drift. Rather than improving the state-of-the-art methods, this paper presents a semi-supervised framework to deal with the challenges above. The objective of the proposed framework is to learn from streaming environment with limited data labels, y and detect real drift concurrently. This paper proposes a novel concept drift detection method utilizing the densities of posterior probabilities in partially labeled streaming environments. Experimental results on both synthetic and realworld datasets show that our proposed semi-supervised framework enables the detection of concept drift in such environment while achieving comparable prediction performance to the state-of-the-art methods."

Importantly, we find that the electronic structures of DHPs are very sensitive to their geometries, especially the - bond lengths. As a consequence, the electronic structures calculated by the HSE functional using the PBE optimized geometries may still significantly underestimate the band gaps, whereas the calculations on the HSE optimized geometries provide much more satisfactory results. The sensitivity of the band gaps of the DHPs to their geometries opens a promising path for the band structure engineering via doping and alloying.

The polar asymmetry of the iso-density contours introduces a significant shift of the EAS core, which is quantitatively expressed as a gap length (GL) parameter between the EAS core and the center of the modified density pattern consisting of several equi-density ellipses. The LDD of EAS particles is usually approximated by a particular type of lateral density function (LDF) which is generally assumed to be polar symmetric about the EAS axis, and cannot describe the asymmetric LDDs accurately. A polar angle-dependent modified lateral density function of EASs has been derived analytically by considering the effect of attenuation of EAS particles in the atmosphere. From the simulation studies, it has been found that the GL manifests sensitivity to the cosmic ray mass composition. The cosmic ray mass sensitivity of the lateral shower age is also re-examined by applying the modified LDF to the simulated data."

In the chiral effective model, the masses of the and are calculated from the leading term, namely the vectorial Weinberg Tomozawa term as well as from the next to leading order contributions, i.e., due to the scalar exchange and the range terms. Due to the Weinberg-Tomozawa term, the mesons experience an attractive interaction in the symmetric nuclear matter, whereas the mesons have a repulsive interaction. Inclusion of the contributions from the scalar exchange and the range terms as well, leads to drop of the masses of both and mesons. The effect of the isospin asymmetry breaks the mass degeneracy of the and (as well as of the and ) mesons, and its effect is observed to be large at high densities.

    "summary": "A learning management system streamlines the management of the teaching process in a centralized place, recording, tracking, and reporting the delivery of educational courses and student performance. Educational knowledge discovery from such an e-learning system plays a crucial role in rule regulation, policy establishment, and system development. However, existing LMSs do not have embedded mining modules to directly extract knowledge. As educational modes become more complex, educational data mining efficiency from those heterogeneous student learning behaviours is gradually degraded. Therefore, an LMS incorporated with an advanced educational mining module is proposed in this study, as a means to mine efficiently from student performance records to provide valuable insights for educators in helping plan effective learning pedagogies, improve curriculum design, and guarantee quality of teaching. Through two illustrative case studies, experimental results demonstrate increased mining efficiency of the proposed mining module without information loss compared to classic educational mining algorithms. The mined knowledge reveals a set of attributes that significantly impact student academic performance, and further classification evaluation validates the identified attributes. The design and application of such an effective LMS can enable educators to learn from past student performance experiences, empowering them to guide and intervene with students in time, and eventually improve their academic success."

A resonant structure of spin-parity is observed in the invariant-mass spectrum with a significance of . The mass and width of the state, modeled with a Breit Wigner lineshape, are determined to be and respectively, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. These properties and the quark content are consistent with those of the open-charm tetraquark candidate observed previously in the final state of the decay. This result confirms the existence of the state in a new decay mode. The state, reported in the decay, is also searched for in the invariant-mass spectrum of the decay, without finding evidence for it."

    "summary": "The interplay between lattice geometry, band topology and electronic correlations in the newly discovered kagome compounds AV Sb (A=K, Rb, Cs) makes this family a novel playground to investigate emergent quantum phenomena, such as unconventional superconductivity, chiral charge density wave and electronic nematicity. These exotic quantum phases naturally leave nontrivial fingerprints in transport properties of AV Sb , both in electrical and thermal channels, which are prominent probes to uncover the underlying mechanisms. In this brief review, we highlight the unusual electrical and thermal transport properties observed in the unconventional charge ordered state of AV3Sb5, including giant anomalous Hall, anomalous Nernst, ambipolar Nernst and anomalous thermal Hall effects. Connections of these anomalous transport properties to time-reversal symmetry breaking, topological and multiband fermiology, as well as electronic nematicity, are also discussed. Finally, a perspective together with challenges of this rapid growing field are given."

The dielectric permittivity is retrieved by fitting reflectivity spectra with a model taking into account multiphonon contributions. The results extrapolated from the measurements are applied to predict a temperature-dependent atom-surface van der Waals interaction. We specifically consider as the atom of interest Cs (8P3/2), the most relevant virtual couplings of which, fall in the range of thermal radiation and are located in the vicinity of the reststrahlen band of fluoride materials."

Our result for this contribution does not agree with theirs, but is in agreement with results from previous calculations where this contribution is given explicitly. In our reply, we explain in detail the validity of the evaluation of our core contribution. We emphasize that the Main, Core and Tail contributions have been treated on an equal footing in our work unlike the sum-over-states calculations. We also address their concerns about our approximate treatment of the contributions from the QED corrections, which was not the aim of our work, but was carried out for completeness. Nonetheless, conclusion of our above mentioned paper is not going to affect if we replace our estimated QED contribution to by earlier estimation."

The Heisenberg model is also relevant to the frustrated antiferromagnet, Cs CuCl . We find rich phase diagrams for each model. The Sp(N) antiferromagnet is shown to have five different phases as a function of the size of the spin and the degree of anisotropy of the triangular lattice. The effects of fluctuations at finite-N are also discussed. For parameters relevant to Cs CuCl the ground state either exhibits incommensurate spin order, or is in a quantum disordered phase with deconfined spin-1/2 excitations and topological order. The SU(N) Hubbard-Heisenberg model exhibits an insulating dimer phase, an insulating box phase, a semi-metallic staggered flux phase (SFP), and a metallic uniform phase. The uniform and SFP phases exhibit a pseudogap. A metal-insulator transition occurs at intermediate values of the interaction strength."

A characterization of those metrics is given in terms of operator monotone functions. Several concrete metrics are constructed and analyzed, in particular, instead of the uniqueness in the probabilistic case, there is a large class of monotone metrics. Some of those appeared already in the physics literature a long time ago. A limiting procedure to pure states is discussed as well."

In the present study, additional symptom of the two-third magnetization plateau was found in the field derivative of the magnetization process. The magnetic structure was found to be incommensurate with the ordering vector at zero field.

The Fermi surfaces of these systems have a multisheet character and are compiled of a large number of cylinders at the edges and in the central part of the Brillouin zone.

When using a single qubit as the probe (used to control the unitary we wish to estimate the eigenvalue of), it is not possible to measure the phase with a minimum mean-square error. In standard methods, there would be a logarithmic (in error) number of control qubits needed in order to achieve this minimum error. Here show how to perform this measurement using only two control qubits, thereby reducing the qubit requirements of the quantum algorithm. Our method corresponds to preparing the optimal control state one qubit at a time, while it is simultaneously consumed by the measurement procedure."

Recently, coexisting and competing 2 2 4 and 2 2 2 CDW phases were discovered in . To investigate the evolution of the CDW phases with the substitution of V atoms, we performed x-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments on and . Our results indicate that in all substituted samples, the discrete CDW reflection points in pristine change to rod-like structures along the direction. This suggests that the long-ranged three-dimensional CDW becomes quasi-two-dimensional by the substitution of V by Ta/Nb. Moreover, our temperature-dependent measurements show that there is no hysteresis behavior of CDW signals, indicating that the 2 2 4 CDW phase is easily suppressed by even a slight substitution of V with Nb/Ta. These findings uncover the CDW evolution upon substitution of V atoms in CsV Sb , providing insights into the microscopic mechanism of CDW and helping to understand the interplay between intertwined phases and superconductivity."

A theoretical model was developed to describe quantitatively the resonance signals by correlation analysis of the optical Bloch equations in the case when an atom simultaneously interacts with two laser fields in the presence of an external dc electric field. The simulations described well the experimental signals. The tensor polarizabilities (in Bohr radii cubed) were determined to be 7.45(20) x 10^4 for the 7D_3/2 state and 1.183(35) x 10^6 for the 9D_3/2 state; a well established tensor polarizability value for 10D_3/2 was used to calibrate the electric field.

    "summary": "So far, the striking sign reversal in the near-ambient slope of the gap temperature dependence of colloidal CsPbCl3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) compared to its Br counterpart, remains unresolved. Pure bromide NCs exhibit a linear gap increase with increasing temperature, to which thermal expansion and electron-phonon interaction equally contribute. In contrast, the temperature slope for the chlorine compound gap is outspoken negative. By combining temperature and pressure-dependent photoluminescence on a series of CsPb(Br1-xClx)3 NCs, we unravel the origin of such inversion. Responsible is solely the electron-phonon interaction, undergoing a sudden change in sign and magnitude due to activation of an anomalous electron-phonon coupling mechanism linked to vibrational modes characterized by synchronous octahedral tilting and Cs rattling. This takes place in the shrunken orthorhombic NC lattice for Cl concentrations exceeding ca. 40%. We have thus clarified a puzzling result directly impacting the optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskite NCs."

    "title": "Unifying Graph Contrastive Learning with Flexible Contextual Scopes",
    "summary": "Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has recently emerged as an effective learning paradigm to alleviate the reliance on labelling information for graph representation learning. The core of GCL is to maximise the mutual information between the representation of a node and its contextual representation (i.e., the corresponding instance with similar semantic information) summarised from the contextual scope (e.g., the whole graph or 1-hop neighbourhood). This scheme distils valuable self-supervision signals for GCL training. However, existing GCL methods still suffer from limitations, such as the incapacity or inconvenience in choosing a suitable contextual scope for different datasets and building biased contrastiveness. To address aforementioned problems, we present a simple self-supervised learning method termed Unifying Graph Contrastive Learning with Flexible Contextual Scopes (UGCL for short). Our algorithm builds flexible contextual representations with tunable contextual scopes by controlling the power of an adjacency matrix. Additionally, our method ensures contrastiveness is built within connected components to reduce the bias of contextual representations. Based on representations from both local and contextual scopes, UGCL optimises a very simple contrastive loss function for graph representation learning. Essentially, the architecture of UGCL can be considered as a general framework to unify existing GCL methods. We have conducted intensive experiments and achieved new state-of-the-art performance in six out of eight benchmark datasets compared with self-supervised graph representation learning baselines. Our code has been open-sourced."

In this case a power spectrum analysis of AFM data showed a significant drop, in spectral density, as compared to the same obtained for a fluence, . This drop, together with damage saturation, can be correlated with a transition to a stress relaxed amorphous phase.

We focus on the case where the external magnetic field exceeds the saturation field and is oriented along the crystallographic axis perpendicular to the lattice plane. Because in this case the excited states are separated by an energy gap from the ground state, we may use the self-consistent ladder approximation to take the strong correlations due to the hard-core constraint into account. In Cs CuCl there are additional interactions besides the hard-core interaction which we treat in self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. We calculate the spectral function of the hard-core bosons from which we obtain the in-plane components of the dynamic structure factor, the magnetic susceptibility, and the specific heat. Our results for the specific heat are in good agreement with the available experimental data. We conclude that the self-consistent ladder approximation in combination with a self-consistent Hartree-Fock decoupling of the non-hard-core interactions gives an accurate description of the physical properties of gapped hard-core bosons in two dimensions at finite temperatures."

To analyse the observed distributions in light of the H2CS binding energy, in order to discuss the role of thermal desorption in enriching the gas disk component. Methods: In the context of the ALMA chemical survey of Disk-Outflow sources in the Taurus star forming region (ALMA-DOT), we observed five Class I or early Class II sources with the o-H2CS(7_1,6-6_1,5) line on a 40 au scale. We estimated the binding energy (BEs) of H2CS using quantum mechanical calculations, for the first time, for an extended, periodic, crystalline ice. Results: We imaged H2CS in two rotating molecular rings in the HL Tau and IRAS04302+2247 disks. The outer radii are about 140 au (HL Tau), and 115 au (IRAS 04302+2247). The edge-on geometry of IRAS 04302+2247 reveals that H2CS emission peaks, at radii of 60-115 au, at z = +- 50 au from the equatorial plane. The column densities are about 10^14 cm^-2. For HL Tau, we derive, for the first time, the [H2CS]/[H] abundance in a protoplanetary disk (about 10^-14). The BEs of H2CS computed for extended crystalline ice and amorphous ices is 4258 K and 3000-4600 K, respectively, implying a thermal evaporation where dust temperature is larger than 50-80 K. Conclusions: H2CS traces the so-called warm molecular layer, a region previously sampled using CS, and H2CO. Thioformaldehyde peaks closer to the protostar than H2CO and CS, plausibly due to the relatively high-excitation level of observed 7_1,6-6_1,5 line (60 K). The H2CS BEs implies that thermal desorption dominates in thin, au-sized, inner and/or upper disk layers, indicating that the observed H2CS emitting up to radii larger than 100 au is likely injected in the gas due to non-thermal processes."

Here we show how to construct a local coarse graining description of partitioned cellular automata. By making use of this tool we investigate the effective dynamics in this model of computation. All examples explored are in the scenario of lattice gases, so that the information lost after the coarse graining is related to the number of particles. It becomes apparent how difficult it is to remain with a deterministic dynamics after coarse graining. Several examples are shown where an effective stochastic dynamics is obtained after a deterministic dynamics is coarse grained. These results suggest why random processes are so common in nature."

    "title": "Three-dimensional bond-order formation in kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K) analyzed by the density-wave equation method",
    "summary": "The mechanism of CDW and its 3D structure are important fundamental issues in kagome metals. We have previously shown that, based on a 2D model, bond order (BO) emerges due to the paramagnon-interference (PMI) mechanism and that its fluctuations lead to -wave superconductivity. This paper studies these issues based on realistic 3D models for kagome metals AV Sb (A=Cs, Rb, K). We reveal that a commensurate 3D BO is caused by the PMI mechanism, by performing the 3D density-wave (DW) equation analysis for all A=Cs, Rb, K models in detail. Our results indicate a BO transition temperature K within the regime of moderate electron correlation. The 3D structure of BO is attributed to the three-dimensionality of the Fermi surface, while the 3D structure of BO is sensitively changed since the Fermi surface is quasi-2D. In the DW equation analysis, the most favorable 3D structure is (i) the alternating vertical stacking BO, where star-of-David (SoD) and tri-hexagonal (TrH) patterns stack alternatively. Other candidate is (ii) the shift-stacking BO composed of either SoD or TrH pattern. We find that the 3D structure of BO can be determined by the 3rd-order Ginzburg-Landau free energy . Since depends sensitively on the band structure, both (i) and (ii) can be realized. The present study enhances our understanding of the rich variety of BOs observed experimentally. It is confirmed that the PMI mechanism is the essential origin of the 3D CDW of kagome metals."

    "summary": "Quantum spin liquids~(QSLs) represent a unique quantum disordered state of matter that hosts long-range quantum entanglement and fractional excitations. However, structural disorder resulting from site mixing between different types of ions usually arises in real QSL candidates, which is considered as an obstacle to gain the insight into the intrinsic physics. Here, we have synthesized two new rare-earth compounds Rb Yb(VO ) and Cs Yb(VO ) . X-ray diffractions reveal a perfect triangular-lattice structure with no detectable disorder. Magnetic susceptibility measurements do not capture any phase transition or spin freezing down to 1.8~K. A fit to low-temperature data indicates dominant antiferromagnetic interactions with the Curie-Weiss temperature of -1.40~K and -0.43~K for Rb Yb(VO ) and Cs Yb(VO ) , respectively. Specific heat results show no sign of long-range magnetic order down to 0.1~K either, but only a Schottky anomaly that is continuously mediated by the external magnetic fields. Additionally, inelastic neutron scattering is employed to detect low-energy spin excitations in Rb Yb(VO ) . The absence of magnetic excitation signals as well as static magnetic order down to 97~mK aligns with the results from magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. Collectively, these findings point to a quantum disordered ground state with persistent spin dynamics, reminiscent of QSL behaviors. Our work provides a promising platform for further exploration of quantum magnetism in this new disorder-free system."

    "summary": "This article presents a novel network protocol that incorporates a quantum photonic channel for symmetric key distribution, a Dilithium signature to replace factor-based public key cryptography for enhanced authentication, security, and privacy. The protocol uses strong hash functions to hash original messages and verify heightened data integrity at the destination. This Quantum Good Authentication Protocol (QGP) provides high-level security provided by the theory of quantum mechanics. QGP also has the advantage of quantum-resistant data protection that prevents current digital computer and future quantum computer attacks. QGP transforms the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) by adding a quantum layer at the bottom of Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model (layer 0) and modifying the top layer (layer 7) with Dilithium signatures, thus improving the security of the original OSI model. In addition, QGP incorporates strong encryption, hardware-based quantum channels, post-quantum signatures, and secure hash algorithms over a platform of decryptors, switches, routers, and network controllers to form a testbed of the next-generation, secure quantum internet. The experiments presented here show that QGP provides secure authentication and improved security and privacy and can be adopted as a new protocol for the next-generation quantum Internet."

We find that vacancy order enhances electron correlations, resulting in the onset of a block antiferromagnetic phase with large moments at smaller interaction strengths. In addition, vacancy ordering modulates the kinetic energy differently for the three orbitals. This results in a breaking of the degeneracy between the and orbitals on each Fe site, and the onset of orbital order. Consequently, we obtain a novel inverse relation between orbital polarization and the magnetic moment. We predict that a transition from high-spin to low-spin states accompanied by a crossover from orbitally-disordered to orbitally-ordered states will be driven by doping the parent compound with electrons, which can be verified by neutron scattering and soft X-ray measurements."

Contrary to the case of = K and Rb, the energetic positions of the low-lying Van Hove singularities are reversed in CsV Sb , and the characteristic higher-order Van Hove point gets closer to the Fermi level. We found that this notable difference can be attributed to the chemical effect, apart from structural differences. Due to their different orbital compositions, Van Hove points show qualitatively different responses to the structure changes. A previously unnoticed highest lying point can be lowered, locating close to or even below the other ones in response to a reasonable range of bi- and uni-axial strain. Our results can be useful in better understanding the material-dependent features reported in this family and in realizing experimental control of exotic quantum phases."

    "summary": "The polar metal is a material that hosts both polar distortion and metallicity. Such a material is expected to show exotic magneto-electric phenomena if superconducts. Here, we theoretically explore ferroelectric and superconducting properties in a series of perovskite-type oxyhydrides ATiO H (A=K, Rb, Cs) under hole-doping conditions using the first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory. Our simulation shows that these compounds host spontaneous polarization and superconductivity at optimal doping concentration. The unusual coexistence of superconductivity and large polarization (~100 C/cm ) originates from weak coupling of the polar distortion and superconducting states, the reason of which is separation of the displaced atoms and spacially confined metallic carriers. Besides, the superconductivity is enhanced by the unique electronic properties near the valence band maximum: quartic band dispersion with a sizable contribution of hydrogen 1s states. Our study thus feature the oxyhydrides as possible model polar superconducting systems, which may be utilizable for future magneto-electric devices."

Through first-principles calculations combined with group-theoretical analyses, we investigate the structural phase diagram of Pb-free Jahn-Teller-active Au ( : Cs, Rb; : Cl, Br, I) double perovskites. Our study identifies a previously unreported ferroelectric phase, where the softening of the polar mode key to ferroelectricity, is driven by an unconventional and indirect coupling with improper strains originating from Jahn-Teller distortions. The proposed strain mediated pseudo triggered mechanism offers an alternative pathway to enhance the static dielectric constant or even promote (photo-)ferroelectricity, addressing challenges such as defects, excitons, and charge scattering that hinder photovoltaic efficiency. More broadly, this unique mechanism could be extended to oxide double perovskites and opens up a new type of ferroelectric phase transition worthy of future investigation."

Different from the structural similar kagome superconductors V Sb , no charge density wave instabilities are found in Ti Bi . At low temperatures below 5 K, signatures of superconductivity appear in Ti Bi as seen in magnetization measurements. However, bulk superconductivity is not evidenced by specific heat results. Similar to V Sb , Ti Bi show nonlinear magnetic field dependence of the Hall effect below about 70 K, pointing to a multiband nature. Unlike V Sb in which phonons and electron-phonon coupling play important roles in thermal transport, the thermal conductivity in Ti Bi is dominated by electronic contributions. Moreover, our calculated electronic structure suggests that van Hove singularities are sitting well above the Fermi energy. Compared with V Sb , the absence of charge orders in Ti Bi is closely associated with minor contributions from electron-phonon coupling and/or van Hove singularities."

Our present targets are the newly discovered PM J22299+3024, and the already known LP 119-10 variables. LP 119-10 was also observed by the TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) space telescope in 120-second cadence mode. Methods. We performed standard Fourier analysis of the daily, weekly, and the whole data sets, together with test data of different combinations of weekly observations. We then performed asteroseismic fits utilising the observed and the calculated pulsation periods. For the calculations of model grids necessary for the fits, we applied the 2018 version of the White Dwarf Evolution Code. Results. We derived six possible pulsation modes for PM J22299+3024, and five plus two TESS pulsation frequencies for LP 119-10. Note that further pulsation frequencies may be present in the data sets, but we found their detection ambiguous, so we omitted them from the final frequency list. Our asteroseismic fits of PM J22299+3024 give 11 400 K and 0.46 Msun for the effective temperature and the stellar mass. The temperature is ~800 K higher, while the mass of the model star is exactly the same as it was earlier derived by spectroscopy. Our model fits of LP~119-10 put the effective temperature in the range of 11 800 - 11 900 K, which is again higher than the spectroscopic 11 290 K value, while our best model solutions give M* = 0.70 Msun mass for this target, near to the spectroscopic value of 0.65 Msun, likewise in the case of PM J22299+3024. The seismic distances of our best-fitting model stars agree with the Gaia astrometric distances of PM J22299+3024 and LP 119-10 within the errors, validating our model results."

    "title": "Celestial sunflowers -- Survival of rings around small planetary bodies under solar radiation pressure",
    "summary": "Context: Rings around giant planets are a common feature of the solar system. Even though solar radiation pressure is known to destabilize rings by exciting the orbital eccentricity of its particles, the Centaur Chariklo (and possibly Chiron), the dwarf planet Haumea, and trans-Neptunian object Quaoar also host rings of solid material. Aims: We explore the dynamical evolution of rings around spherical Chariklo and Haumea analogs, assuming different particle sizes and tilt angles with respect to the planetary orbital plane of the ring. Methods: The ring dynamics were studied using a GPU-based N-body integrator with an 8th-order Hermite scheme for several thousand years, corresponding to 10 solar orbits. The simulations took into account the gravitational effects of the planet and the Sun, radiation pressure, and the shadow cast by the planet. Results: Two families of rings have been identified depending on the ring tilt angle. Slightly tilted rings ( =50 deg), however, show instability only for a range of particle sizes that spans 1-10 times the critical size. The planetary shadow reduces the critical size by a factor of five and extends the instability region to 0.1-10 times this newly identified critical size. Conclusions: The stabilization of highly inclined rings occurs because the plane of the ring is forced to be perpendicular to the Solar radiation. As a result, the plane of the ring rotates as the planetary bodies revolves: always facing the sun, like a celestial sunflower. Rings which are closely aligned to the orbital plane of the host planet, such as Haumea and Quaoar, presumably consist of particles with a size at least 1-4 um. However, particles in the rings which are highly tilted, like that around Chariklo and Chiron, should consist of particles =60-300 um."

We analyze systematically the evolution of the van Hove singularities (vHss) across the entire family upon applied pressure and hole doping, specifically focusing on the two vHss closer to the Fermi energy. With pressure, these two saddle points shift away from the Fermi level. At the same time, the Fermi surface undergoes a large reconstruction with respect to the Sb bands while the V bands remain largely unchanged, pointing to the relevant role of the Sb atoms in the electronic structure of these materials. Upon hole doping, we find the opposite trend, where the saddle points move closer to the Fermi level for increasing dopings. All in all, we show how pressure and doping are indeed two mechanisms that can be used to tune the location of the two vHss closer to the Fermi level and can be exploited to tune different Fermi surface instabilities and associated orders."

SPS is introduced for linear regression models, including but not limited to FIR systems, and we show that the SPS confidence regions have exact confidence probabilities, i.e., they contain the true parameter with a user-chosen exact probability for any finite data set. Moreover, we also prove that the SPS regions are star convex with the Least-Squares (LS) estimate as a star center. The main assumptions of SPS are that the noise terms are independent and symmetrically distributed about zero, but they can be nonstationary, and their distributions need not be known. The paper also proposes a computationally efficient ellipsoidal outer approximation algorithm for SPS. Finally, SPS is demonstrated through a number of simulation experiments."

The scale and complexity of mathematics, along with discovered paradoxes, revealed the danger of accumulating errors across theories. Although, according to Gödel's incompleteness theorems, it is not possible to construct a single formal system which will describe all phenomena in the world, being complete and consistent at the same time, it gave rise to rather practical areas of logic, such as the theory of automated theorem proving. This is a set of techniques used to verify mathematical statements mechanically using logical reasoning. Moreover, it can be used to solve complex engineering problems as well, for instance, to prove the security properties of a software system or an algorithm. This paper compares two widespread tools for automated theorem proving, Isabelle/HOL and Coq, with respect to expressiveness, limitations and usability. For this reason, it firstly gives a brief introduction to the bases of formal systems and automated deduction theory, their main problems and challenges, and then provides detailed comparison of most notable features of the selected theorem provers with support of illustrative proof examples."

Using a double-pump scheme we measured a lifetime of the charge transfer excitation into single valence Au of less than 4 ps, which is an indication of the local character of the Au excitation. Furthermore, the strong similarity between the pressure and fluence dependence of the phonon softening shows that the inter-valence charge transfer plays an important role in the structural transition."

The prototype of these sources is currently under testing in the SPIDER experiment, part of the Neutral Beam Test Facility of Consorzio RFX, Padua, Italy. Among the targets of the experimentation in SPIDER, it is of foremost importance to maximize the beam current density extracted from the source acceleration system. The SPIDER operating conditions can be optimized thanks to a Cavity Ring-down Spectroscopy diagnostic, which is able to give line-integrated measurements of negative ion density in proximity of the acceleration system apertures. Regarding the diagnostic technique, this work presents a phenomenon of drift in ring down time measurements, which develops in a time scale of few hours. This issue may significantly affect negative ion density measurements for plasma pulses of 1 h duration, as required by ITER. Causes and solutions are discussed. Regarding the source performance, this paper presents how negative ion density is influenced by the RF power used to sustain the plasma, and by the magnetic filter field present in SPIDER to limit the amount of co-extracted electrons.

However, the origin of the cLC and its relation to other phases have been uncovered. Here, we discover a novel mechanism of the cLC state, by focusing on the BO phase common in kagome metals. The BO fluctuations in metals mediate the odd-parity particle-hole condensation, which drives the topological charge-current. This state is further stabilized by the finite electron-phonon coupling and the off-site Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the predicted cLC+BO phase gives rise to the Z3-nematic state in addition to the giant anomalous Hall effect. The present theory predicts the close relationship between the cLC, the BO, and the nematicity, which is significant to understand the cascade of quantum electron states in kagome metals."

However, when the potential energy landscape exhibits more anharmonicity, for instance, in case of a weakly bonded crystal or when the temperature is raised, the approximation fails to capture all crystal lattice dynamics properly. Phonon-phonon scattering mechanisms become important and limit the phonon lifetimes. We take a novel approach and simulate the phonon dispersion of a complex dynamic solid at elevated temperatures with Machine-Learning Force Fields of near-first-principles accuracy. Through large-scale molecular dynamics simulations the projected velocity autocorrelation function (PVACF) is obtained. We apply this approach to the inorganic perovskite CsPbBr . Imaginary modes in the harmonic picture of this perovskite are absent in the PVACF, indicating a dynamic stabilization of the crystal. The anharmonic nature of the potential makes a decoupling of the system into a weakly interacting phonon gas impossible. The phonon spectra of CsPbBr show the characteristics of a phonon liquid. Rattling motions of the Cs cations are studied by self-correlation functions and are shown to be nearly dispersionless motions of the cations with a frequency of 0.8THz within the lead-bromide framework."

The effects due to the magnetic field as well as isospin asymmetry are observed to be appreciable at high densities for the charmonium states, which can have consequences, e,g, in the production of the open charm mesons and the charmonium states, in the asymmetric heavy ion collisions at the compressed baryonic matter (CBM) experiments at the future facility at GSI. The presence of magnetic field leads to Landau quantization of the energy levels of the proton in the asymmetric nuclear matter.

Furthermore, a decreasing power-law exponent of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate , probing the in-plane spin fluctuations, evidences an emergent deviation from Fermi-liquid behavior.

We discuss recent results as they relate to the interplay of the attendant IR-Improved DGLAP-CS theory of one of us and the precision of exact NLO matrix-element matched parton shower MC's in the Herwig6.5 environment as determined by comparison to recent LHC experimental observations on single heavy gauge boson production and decay. The level of agreement between the new theory and the data continues to be a reason for optimism. In the spirit of completeness, we discuss as well other approaches to the same theoretical predictions that we make here from the standpoint of physical precision with an eye toward the (sub-)1% QCD EW total theoretical precision regime for LHC physics."

    "title": "Anomaly Detection in Dynamic Graphs via Transformer",
    "summary": "Detecting anomalies for dynamic graphs has drawn increasing attention due to their wide applications in social networks, e-commerce, and cybersecurity. Recent deep learning-based approaches have shown promising results over shallow methods. However, they fail to address two core challenges of anomaly detection in dynamic graphs: the lack of informative encoding for unattributed nodes and the difficulty of learning discriminate knowledge from coupled spatial-temporal dynamic graphs. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we present a novel Transformer-based Anomaly Detection framework for DYnamic graphs (TADDY). Our framework constructs a comprehensive node encoding strategy to better represent each node's structural and temporal roles in an evolving graphs stream. Meanwhile, TADDY captures informative representation from dynamic graphs with coupled spatial-temporal patterns via a dynamic graph transformer model. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed TADDY framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on six real-world datasets."

    "summary": "The solution of linear systems of equations is the basis of many other quantum algorithms, and recent results provided an algorithm with optimal scaling in both the condition number and the allowable error [PRX Quantum 3 , 040303 (2022)]. That work was based on the discrete adiabatic theorem, and worked out an explicit constant factor for an upper bound on the complexity. Here we show via numerical testing on random matrices that the constant factor is in practice about 1,200 times smaller than the upper bound found numerically in the previous results. That means that this approach is far more efficient than might naively be expected from the upper bound. In particular, it is about an order of magnitude more efficient than using a randomised approach from [arXiv:2305.11352] that claimed to be more efficient."

We introduce a workflow that can be used to convert volumetric medical imaging data (as generated by Computer Tomography (CT)) to computer-based models where we can perform interaction of tool with the tissue. This process is broken up into two steps: image segmentation and tool-tissue interaction. We demonstrate the utility of this streamlined workflow by creating models of a liver. A FE model for probe insertion has been developed using cohesive elements to simulate the tissue rupture phenomena. FE based simulations are performed and the results are compared with that of various published papers. An analytical model that governs the reaction forces on the needle tip has also been developed. Expressions for reaction forces acting in both axial and transverse directions on a symmetric tip needle and a bevel tip needle are developed. These models consider local tissue deformation by the needle and the frictional forces generated due to the inclusion of the needle in the tissue, but do not consider the role of tissue rupture toughness parameter Gc due to which some differences are visible in FE based simulations and these analytical results."

Here we study the higher-group structure in (3+1)D gauge theory with an emergent fermion, and point out that pumping chiral topological states gives rise to a 0-form symmetry with mixed gravitational anomaly. This ordinary symmetry mixes with the other higher symmetries to form a 3-group structure, which we examine in detail. We then show that in the context of stabilizer quantum codes, one can obtain logical CCZ and CS gates by placing the code on a discretization of (3-torus) and (2-torus bundle over the circle) respectively, and pumping states. Our considerations also imply the possibility of a logical gate by placing the code on and pumping a topological state."

The presence of a magnetic field leads to Landau quantization of the energy levels of the proton in the nuclear medium. The effects of magnetic field and isospin asymmetry on the charmonium decay widths to are found to be quite prominent. The effects of the anomalous magnetic moments have also been taken into consideration for obtaining the in-medium masses of these heavy flavour mesons, used to calculate the partial decay widths of the charmonium states. The medium modifications of the charmonium decay widths can have observable consequences on the production of the charmed mesons in high energy asymmetric heavy ion collision experiments."

In this work, the possibility of photo-transmutation of long-lived radionuclide Cs-135 by laser-plasma driven electron source has been demonstrated through Geant4 simulations. High energy electron generation, bremsstrahlung and photonuclear reaction have been observed at four different laser intensities of 10^ 20 W/cm^2, 5 times 10^ 20 W/cm^2, 10^ 21 W/cm^2 and 5 times 10^ 21 W/cm^2, respectively. It was shown that the laser intensity and the target geometry have strong effect on the transmutation reaction yield. At different laser intensities the recommended target sizes were found to obtain the maximum reaction yield. The remarkable feature of this work is to evaluate the optimal laser intensity to produce maximum reaction yield of 10^8 per Joule in laser pulse energy, which is 10^ 21 W/cm^2. Our study suggests photo-transmutation driven by laser-based electron source as a promising approach for experimental research into transmutation reactions, with potential applications to nuclear waste management."

    "summary": "Recent experiments have synthesized Cs2AgBi2I9 by partially substituting Cs+ with Ag+ at the A-site of Cs3Bi2I9, resulting in enhanced charge transport properties compared to Cs3Bi2I9. However, the atomic-scale mechanisms behind this enhancement remain unclear. In this work, we investigate the carrier transport mechanisms in Cs2A'Bi2I9 (A' = Ag, Cu) using first-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport calculations. Our results reveal that A-site ordered Cs2A'Bi2I9 exhibits carrier mobilities that are 3-4 times higher than those of Cs3Bi2I9 within the 100-500 K temperature range. We identify polar phonon scattering as the dominant mechanism limiting mobility. Furthermore, the enhanced out-of-plane carrier mobility in Cs2A'Bi2I9, particularly between 100 and 200K, leads to reduced mobility anisotropy. These improvements are mainly due to the shorter A'-I bond lengths and increased Ag+/Cu+ s-I p orbital coupling. Notably, substitution with Cu+ results in a further reduction in the band gap and enhanced hole mobility compared to Ag+ substitution in Cs3Bi2I9. Further analysis reveals that the significant increase in carrier mobility in Cs2A'Bi2I9 can be largely explained by the smaller carrier effective masses (m*) and weaker Fröhlich coupling strengths (α), resulting in a lower polar mass α(m*/me), compared to Cs3Bi2I9. Our study provides valuable insights into the transport properties of Bi-based perovskite derivatives, paving the way for their future applications in optoelectronic devices."

This implies that a dimer-monomer composite chain without frustration is a good starting point for describing these compounds."

We found Cs Co S to be a ferrimagnetic half-metal with a total spin magnetic moment of about 3 per formula unit. It shows energy band gap of 0.36 eV in the majority-spin channel and a pseudo-gap at the Fermi level in the minority-spin channel.

The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity is predicted to reach a magnitude up to 500 cm , which is comparable to values obtained in other celebrated Weyl semimetals."

These features prompt critical questions regarding the roles of magnetism and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in these systems. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate a notable sensitivity of the magnetic properties to the choice of -point mesh used in Brillouin zone integrations. Specifically, we find that using a dense -point mesh yields a nonmagnetic pristine phase characterized by paramagnetic susceptibility, consistent with the recently observed Pauli paramagnetic behavior in single crystalline samples at high temperatures. In contrast, a coarser -point mesh significantly increases the density of states at the Fermi level, inducing a ferromagnetic instability that satisfies the Stoner criterion. Moreover, our results show that the effect of SOC on both the geometric and electronic structures is minimal, with only a slight gap opening at the Dirac points, indicating a weak SOC influence in these materials. Importantly, our DFT band structure calculations closely align with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data, reinforcing the notion of weak electron correlations in these kagome metals. This refined understanding challenges recent theoretical assertions that the interplay of magnetism, SOC, and electron correlations is essential for determining the nature of charge density waves in AV Sb ."

Under the type-0 phase-matching condition, the purity at 1550 nm was between 0.91 and 0.92, and the purity can be maintained over 0.90 from 1500 nm to 2000 nm wavelength. Under the type-II phase-matching condition, the purity at 1550 nm was 0.96, 0.97, 0.97, 0.98, and 0.98 for PPKTP, PPRTP, PPKTA, PPRTA, and PPCTA, respectively; furthermore, the purity can be kept over 0.96 for more than 600 nm wavelength range. We also simulated the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between independent photon sources for PPRTP crystals at 1550 nm, and interference visibility was 92% (97%) under type-0 (type-II) phase-matching condition.

Based on first-principle calculations, we investigate the physical properties of the already synthesized AMnBi(A =K, Rb, Cs)-family materials. We show that these materials are antiferromagnetic (AFM), with Neel temperatures above 300 K. They contain AFM ordered Mn layers, while the interlayer coupling changes from ferromagnetic (FM) for KMnBi to AFM for RbMnBi and CsMnBi. We find that these materials are narrow gap semiconductors. Owing to the small effective mass, the electron carrier mobility can be very high, reaching up to 100,000 cm2/(Vs) for KMnBi. In contrast, the hole mobility is much suppressed, typically lower by two orders of magnitude. We further study their two-dimensional (2D) single layer structures, which are found be AFM with fairly high mobility (1000 cm2/(Vs)). Their Neel temperatures can still reach room temperature. Interesting, we find that the magnetic phase transition is also accompanied by a metal-insulator phase transition, with the paramagnetic metal phase possessing a pair of nonsymmorphic-symmetry-protected 2D spin-orbit Dirac points. Furthermore, the magnetism can be effectively controlled by the applied strain. When the magnetic ordering is turned into FM, the system can become a quantum anomalous Hall insulator with gapless chiral edge states."

In this classical model, the direction of motion changes only when the particles collide head-on, preserving momentum and energy. In our quantum model, the dynamics is driven by the usual quantum-walk evolution operator if the particles are on different nodes, and is driven by the HPP rules if the particles are in the same node, linearly extended for superpositions. Using this new form of evolution operator, we numerically analyze three physical quantities for the two-walker case: The probability distribution of the position of one walker, the standard deviation of the position of one walker, and the entanglement between the walkers as a function of the number of steps. The numerical analysis implies that the entanglement between the walkers as a function of the number of steps initially increases and quickly tends to a constant value, which depends on the initial condition. We compare the results obtained using the HPP interaction with the equivalent ones using the phase interaction, which is based on an evolution operator that inverts the sign of the coin operator if the walkers are in the same position."

This choice of systems allows for a systematic analysis of the interplay of Hund's coupling and on-site Coulomb repulsion in multi-orbital Fe-pnictides under negative pressure. With increasing ionic size of the alkali metal, we observe a non-trivial change in the iron hoppings, an increase of orbitally-selective correlations and the presence of incoherent weight at high-binding energies that do not show the typical lower Hubbard-band behavior but rather characteristic features of a Hund's metal. This is especially prominent in -stretched CsFe As .

We compare ion yields obtained with and without CEP-stabilization: with 8-cycle (22 fs) pulses, Xe yields are suppressed (relative to Xe yields) by between 30% and 50%, depending on phase, reflecting the phase dependence of non-sequential ionization and its contribution to the formation of higher charge states. On the other hand, ion yields for Xe ( =2-4) with CEP-stablized pulses are enhanced (by up to 50%) compared to those with CEP-unstabilized pulses. Such enhancment is particulary pronounced with 2-cycle (5 fs) pulses and is distinctly phase-dependent. Orbital shape and symmetry are found to have a bearing on the response of CS to variations in optical field that are effected as CE phase is controllably altered, keeping the overall intensity constant. Molecular fragmentation is found to depend on field strength (not intensity); the observed relative enhancement of fragmentation when CEP-stabilized 2-cycle pulses are used is found to be at the expense of molecular ionization."

    "summary": "Multiple anomalous features in electronic spectra of metals with kagome lattice structure -- van Hove singularities, Dirac points, and flat bands -- imply that materials containing this structural motif may lie at a nexus of topological and correlated electron physics. Due to the prospects of such exceptional electronic behavior, the recent discovery of superconductivity coexisting with charge-density wave (CDW) order in the layered kagome metals AV Sb (A=K,Rb,Cs) has attracted considerable attention. Notably, these kagome metals express unconventional magnetotransport behavior, including a linear-in-H diagonal resistivity at low fields, and an even more peculiar, nonmonotonic sign-changing behavior of the Hall resistivity, which has been speculated to arise from a chiral CDW. We argue here that this unusual magnetotransport derives not from such unconventional phenomena, but rather from the unique fermiology of the AV Sb materials. Specifically, it is caused by a large, concave hexagonal Fermi surface sheet formed in the close proximity to the van Hove singularities, which is backfolded into a small hexagonal sheet and two large triangular sheets in the CDW state. We introduce a model of the electronic structure of these Fermi surface sheets that allows for a full analytical treatment within Boltzmann kinetic theory and that enables semi-quantitative fits of our transport data. Specifically, we find that the anomalous magnetotransport behavior is caused by the confluence of strong reduction of the Fermi velocity near the van Hove singularities located near the vertices of the hexagonal sheet and sharp corners in Fermi surface generated by the CDW reconstruction."

    "summary": "The quantum physics of ions and electrons behind low-energy spectra of strongly correlated molecular conductors, superconductors and Mott insulators is poorly known, yet fascinating especially in orbitally degenerate cases. The fulleride insulator Cs C (A15), one such system, exhibits infrared (IR) spectra with low temperature peak features and splittings suggestive of static Jahn-Teller distortions with breakdown of orbital symmetry in the molecular site. That is puzzling, for there is no detectable static distortion, and because the features and splittings disappear upon modest heating, which they should not. Taking advantage of the Mott-induced collapse of electronic wavefunctions from lattice-extended to nanoscale localized inside a caged molecular site, we show that unbroken spin and orbital symmetry of the ion multiplets explains the IR spectrum without adjustable parameters. This demonstrates the importance of a fully quantum treatment of nuclear positions and orbital momenta in the Mott insulator sites, dynamically but not statically distorted. The observed demise of these features with temperature is explained by the thermal population of a multiplet term whose nuclear positions are essentially undistorted, but whose energy is very low-lying. That term is in facts a scaled-down orbital excitation analogous to that of other Mott insulators, with the same spin as the ground state, but with a larger orbital moment of two instead of one."

The equation was derived assuming pairing based on interlayer Coulomb interactions between physically separated charges. This theory was initially validated for 31 compounds from five different high-Tc families (within an accuracy of 1.37 K). Herein we report the addition of Fe1+xSe1-y and Fe1+xSe1-yTey (both optimized under pressure) and AzFe2-xSe2 (for A = K, Rb, or Cs) to the growing list of Coulomb-mediated superconducting compounds in which Tc0 is determined by the above equation. Doping in these materials is accomplished through the introduction of excess Fe and/or Se deficiency, or a combination of alkali metal and Fe vacancies. Consequently, a very small number of vacancies or interstitials can induce a superconducting state with a substantial transition temperature. The confirmation of the above equation for these Se-based Fe chalcogenides increases to six the number of superconducting families for which the transition temperature can be accurately predicted."

    "summary": "We investigate the density classification task (DCT) -- determining the majority bit in a one-dimensional binary lattice -- within a quantum cellular automaton (CA) framework. While there is no one-dimensional two-state, radius , deterministic CA with periodic boundary conditions that solves the DCT perfectly, we explore whether a unitary quantum model can succeed. We employ the Partitioned Unitary Quantum Cellular Automaton (PUQCA), a number-conserving model, and, via evolutionary search, find solutions to the DCT where the success condition is stipulated in terms of measurement probabilities rather than convergence to fixed-point configurations. Finally, we identify a classically simulable regime of the PUQCA in which we find rules that solve the DCT at fixed system sizes and analyze their performance."

    "title": "Static Rashba Effect by Surface Reconstruction and Photon Recycling in the Dynamic Indirect Gap of APbBr3 (A = Cs, CH3NH3) Single Crystals",
    "summary": "Recently, halide perovskites have gained significant attention from the perspective of efficient spintronics owing to Rashba effect. This effect occurs as a consequence of strong spin-orbit coupling under noncentrosymmetric environment, which can be dynamic and/or static. However, there exist intense debates on the origin of broken inversion symmetry since the halide perovskites typically crystallize into a centrosymmetric structure. In order to clarify the issue, we examine both dynamic and static effects in the all-inorganic CsPbBr3 and organic-inorganic CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3) perovskite single crystals by employing temperature- and polarization-dependent photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. The perovskite single crystals manifest the dynamic effect by photon recycling in the indirect Rashba gap, causing dual peaks in the photoluminescence. But the effect vanishes in CsPbBr3 at low temperatures (< 50 K), accompanied by a striking color change of the crystal, arising presumably from lower degrees of freedom for inversion symmetry breaking associated with the thermal motion of the spherical Cs cation, compared with the polar MA cation in MAPbBr3. We also show that static Rashba effect occurs only in MAPbBr3 below 90 K due to surface reconstruction via MA-cation ordering, which likely extends across a few layers from the crystal surface to the interior. We further demonstrate that this static Rashba effect can be completely suppressed upon surface treatment with poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) coating. We believe that our results provide a rationale for the Rashba effects in halide perovskites."

We are calculating the form factors by using Fermilab charm and asqtad staggered light and strange quarks on 2+1 flavor asqtad staggered ensembles generated by the MILC Collaboration. We vary the light valence quark masses from 0.4m_s to 0.05m_s (m_s is the strange sea-quark mass), and the lattice spacings, from about 0.12 fm to about 0.045 fm. We extrapolate to the physical light-quark mass and the continuum limit using heavy-light meson staggered chiral perturbation theory about the SU(2) and SU(3) limits, compare the resulting (preliminary) form factor shapes with experiment, and discuss our errors."

    "title": "Unveiling the impact of trivalent metal cation transmutation on Cs$_{2}$AgM(III)Cl$_{6}$ double perovskites using many-body perturbation theory",
    "summary": "Lead-free halide double perovskites A M(I)M(III)X have garnered significant attention in the past decade as promising alternatives to CsPbX perovskites, addressing concerns related to lead toxicity and material instability. In this work, we employ a trivalent metal cation transmutation strategy to design a series of inorganic Pb-free halide double perovskites Cs AgM(III)Cl and perform a comprehensive investigation into their potential for applications in optoelectronic devices. Our first-principles calculations, rooted in density functional theory, demonstrate that these materials possess a face-centered cubic lattice structure while showcasing remarkable thermodynamic, dynamical, and mechanical stability. The G W @PBE electronic bandgap ranges from 1.47-6.20 eV, while the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) indicates strong optical absorption spanning near-infrared to ultraviolet regions for these compounds. Furthermore, the excitonic properties suggest that these perovskites exhibit intermediate exciton binding energies (0.17 to 0.60 eV) and generally longer exciton lifetimes, except for the materials with M(III) = Sc, Y, Tb, and Lu. The Fröhlich model indicates that these materials exhibit intermediate to strong carrier-phonon interactions, with hole-phonon coupling more prominent than electron-phonon coupling. Interestingly, the charge-separated polaronic states are found to be less stable than the bound exciton states, with higher polaron mobility for electrons (4.92-29.03 cm V s ) than for holes (0.56-8.69 cm V s ) in these materials. Overall, our study demonstrates that trivalent metal cation transmutation in Cs AgM(III)Cl enables the creation of stable and lead-free halide double perovskites with exceptional, tunable optoelectronic properties, making them ideal for flexible optoelectronic applications."

In the last decade many different groups claim to achieve its accuracy below 0.5\\%, for the transition in Cs atom. One of the major issues in these calculations is the opposite signs among the core correlation contribution from different works. To estimate of the above transition, various groups have used different many-body methods both in the linear response and sum-over-states approaches. By examining how these methods capture various electron correlation effects, we identify the underlying cause of sign discrepancies in the previously reported results. We also demonstrate how the double-core polarisation effects and scaled wave functions influence estimation of the amplitudes. The comprehensive discussions provided in this work will not only aid in our understanding on the potentials of the employed many-body methods but it will also serves as a road map for improving the calculation in the atomic systems further."

The discovered nematicity has (= ) symmetry, rotated by from the (= ) nematicity in usual compounds with . We predict that the \"nematic bond order\", which is the symmetry-breaking of the correlated hopping, is responsible for the nematic order in AFe As . The Dirac pockets in AFe As is essential to stabilize the bond order. Both and nematicity in A Ba Fe As are naturally induced by the Aslamazov-Larkin many-body process, which describes the spin-fluctuation-driven charge instability.

The force field, denoted as Madrid-2019-Extended, does not include polarizability, and uses the TIP4P/2005 model of water and scaled charges for the ions. A charge of 0.85 e is assigned to monovalent ions. The force field developed provides an accurate description of the aqueous solution densities over a wide range of concentrations up to the solubility limit of each salt studied. Good predictions of viscosity and diffusion coefficients are obtained for concentrations below 2 m. Structural properties obtained with this force field are also in reasonable agreement with the experiment. The number of contact ion pairs has been controlled to be low so as to avoid precipitation of the system at concentrations close to the experimental solubility limit. A comprehensive comparison of the performance for aqueous solutions of alkaline halides of force fields of electrolytes using scaled and integer charges is now possible. This comparison will help in the future to learn about the benefits and limitations of the use of scaled charges to describe electrolyte solutions."

The material possesses two-dimensional V O square nets sandwiched by tellurium layers, with local crystallographic symmetry satisfying the spin symmetry for a -wave altermagnet. An antiferromagnetic transition at 293 K is unambiguously evidenced from the measurements of magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. In addition, a secondary transition at 70 K is also observed, possibly associated with a Lifshitz transition. The first-principles calculations indicate robust Néel-type collinear antiferromagnetism in the V O plane. Consequently, spin splittings show up in momentum space, in relation with the real-space mirror/rotation symmetry. Interestingly, the V- electrons, which primarily contribute the quasi-one-dimensional Fermi surface, turns out to be fully orbital- and spin-polarized, akin to the case of a half metal. Our work lays a solid foundation on the potential applications utilizing altermagnetic properties in vanadium-based oxychalcogenides."

The universality of the model is ensured as long as the mesoscopic and/or microscopic background processes satisfy the applied thermodynamical principles, which are the second law, the basic balances and the existence of an additional-tensorial-state variable. The resulting model, which we suggest to call the Kluitenberg-Verhás body, is the Poynting-Thomson-Zener body with an additional inertial element, or, in other words, is the extension of Jeffreys model to solids. We argue that this Kluitenberg-Verhás body is the natural thermodynamical building block of rheology. An important feature of the presented methodology is that nontrivial inequality-type restrictions arise for the four parameters of the model. We compare these conditions and other aspects to those of other known thermodynamical approaches, like Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics or the original theory of Kluitenberg."

Therefore, the effect that the heavy-ion collision medium can have on those masses and widths, as captured by finite-temperature field theory and reported in the literature, may erase the singularity from the spectrum if the effect is large enough and the loop completes before the hot gas freezes out. A very timely example is provided by the structure recently reported by BES-III in a spectrum recoiling against a . If a new hadron, this would be a clear exotic tetraquark candidate, the first of a charmonium-like family with strangeness: to accept this, alternative explanations first need to be tested and discarded. As shown in figure 1, the mass spectrum recoiling against the kaon is near the threshold, whereas the production cross-section seems to peak around that for . Therefore, this structure may well be caused by a triangle with the three charmed mesons running in the loop, with the amplitude enhanced at the two thresholds. If so, the structure would be erased from the spectrum in Heavy Ion Collisions, whereas a hadron would continue to exist although with a mass decreased by a few percent as computed by other authors."

    "summary": "Using the muon as a sensitive local magnetic probe, we investigated the layered kagome superconductor Cs(V Ti ) Sb , a material notably devoid of both static magnetic moments and long-range charge order. Our transverse-field SR measurements reveal that the local magnetic susceptibility, obtained via the muon Knight shift, is dominated by orbital excitations with a split energy levels around 20 meV. Meanwhile, the persistence of itinerant electron paramagnetism down to 5 K and 7 T confirms the absence of static magnetism within this regime. In addition, zero-field (ZF) SR experiments detect a significant increase in the inhomogeneous nuclear dipolar field distribution below a featured temperature at 70 K. We attribute this ZF- SR feature to the emergence of local lattice distortions at low temperatures, potentially arising from orbital ordering. Significantly, our study establishes that orbital excitations constitute an intrinsic property of the layered V-Sb kagome lattice. Despite its small magnitude, spin-orbit coupling plays a crucial role in governing the lattice dynamics, potentially driving the emergence of novel phenomena such as phonon carrying angular momentum in crystals with non-chiral point groups."

We show and discuss the structural phase transition from to symmetry that are induced by the presence of phonon soft modes. We conclude that the CDW observed in this family of compounds is a consequence of the atom displacement, from the high symmetry position of the kagome net, in low-temperature phase. Additionally, using the numerical ab initio methods, we discuss the charge distribution on the V Sb surface. We show that the observed experimental % stripe-like modulation of the surface, can be related to surface reconstruction and manifestation of the three dimensional bulk CDW. Finally, the consequence of realization of the structure on the electronic properties are discussed.

Such a linear connection plays an important role in the differential geometry of non-Riemannian surfaces in the sense that the Riemannian quadratic forms can be changed into Minkowski functionals in the tangent planes such that the Minkowskian length of the tangent vectors is invariant under the parallel translation with respect to (compatibility condition). A smoothly varying family of Minkowski functionals in the tangent planes is called a Finslerian metric function under some regularity conditions. Especially, the existence of a compatible linear connection provides the Finsler surface to be a so-called generalized Berwald surface. It is an alternative of the Riemannian geometry for . Using some general observations and topological obstructions we concentrate on explicit examples. In some representative cases (Euclidean plane, hyperbolic plane etc.) we solve the differential equation of the parallel vector fields to construct a smoothly varying family of Minkowski functionals in the tangent planes such that the Minkowskian length of the tangent vectors is invariant under the parallel translation."

For cirrus fields with MJysr the formula based on IRAS data (Helou & Beichman, Helou+Beichman_90 ) predicts confusion noise values within a factor of 2 to our measurements. The dependence of the sky confusion noise on the surface brightness was determined for the wavelength range 90 200 m. We verified that the confusion noise scales as N ~ ^ 1.5 , independent of the wavelength and confirmed N ~ lambda^ 2.5 um. The scaling of the noise value at different separations between target and reference positions was investigated for the first time, providing a practical formula. Since our results confirm the applicability of the Helou & Beichman (1990) formula, the cirrus confusion noise predictions made for future space missions with telescopes of a similar size can be trusted. At 90 and 170um a noise term with a Poissonian spatial distribution was detected in the faintest fields ( <= 3-5 MJysr^ -1 ), which we interpret as fluctuations in the Cosmic Far-Infrared Background (CFIRB). Applying ratios of the fluctuation amplitude to the absolute level of 10% and 7% at 90 and 170um, respectively, as supported by model calculations, we achieved a new simultaneous determination of the fluctuation amplitudes and the surface brightness of the CFIRB.

The onset transition temperature barely changes with the Ta doping. Therefore, the bulk superconductivity may be established by a doping-independent local pairing, and it can be suppressed in some regions by the spatially variable CDW order along the -axis.

    "summary": "In this paper, we present a large-scale dynamical survey of the trans-Neptunian region, with particular attention to mean-motion resonances (MMRs). We study a set of 4121 trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), a sample far larger than in previous works. We perform direct long-term numerical integrations that enable us to examine the overall dynamics of the individual TNOs as well as to identify all MMRs. For the latter purpose, we apply the own-developed FAIR method that allows the semi-automatic identification of even very high-order MMRs. Apart from searching for the more frequent eccentricity-type resonances that previous studies concentrated on, we set our method to allow the identification of inclination-type MMRs, too. Furthermore, we distinguish between TNOs that are locked in the given MMR throughout the whole integration time span ( \\,years) and those that are only temporarily captured in resonances. For a more detailed dynamical analysis of the trans-Neptunian space, we also construct dynamical maps using test particles. Observing the fine structure of the ~AU region underlines the stabilizing role of the MMRs, with the regular regions coinciding with the position of the real TNOs."

    "summary": "The dynamical development of collective flow is studied in a (3+1)D fluid dynamical model, with globally symmetric, peripheral initial conditions, which take into account the shear flow caused by the forward motion on the projectile side and the backward motion on the target side. While at \\,TeV semi-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions the earlier predicted rotation effect is visible, at more peripheral collisions, with high resolution and low numerical viscosity the initial development of a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is observed, which alters the flow pattern considerably. This effect provides a precision tool for studying the low viscosity of Quark-gluon Plasma."

    "summary": "The recently discovered layered kagome superconductors V Sb ( = K, Rb, Cs) have garnered significant attention, as they exhibit an intriguing combination of superconductivity, charge density wave (CDW) order, and nontrivial band topology. As such, these kagome systems serve as an exceptional quantum platform for investigating the intricate interplay between electron correlation effects, geometric frustration, and topological electronic structure. A comprehensive understanding of the underlying electronic structure is crucial for unveiling the nature and origin of the CDW order, as well as determining the electron pairing symmetry in the kagome superconductors. In this review, we present a concise survey of the electronic properties of V Sb , with a particular focus on the insights derived from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Through the lens of ARPES, we shed light on the electronic characteristics of the kagome superconductors V Sb , which will pave the way for exciting new research frontiers in kagome-related physics."

    "summary": "Many recent investigations conclude, based on asymptotic complexity analyses, that quantum computers could accelerate combinatorial optimization (CO) tasks relative to a purely classical computer. However, asymptotic analysis alone cannot support a credible claim of quantum advantage. Here, we highlight the challenges involved in benchmarking quantum and classical heuristics for combinatorial optimization (CO), with a focus on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick problem. Whereas hope remains that a quadratic quantum advantage is possible,our numerical analysis casts doubt on the idea that current methods exhibit any quantum advantage at all. This doubt arises because even a simple classical approach can match with quantum methods we investigated. We conclude that more careful numerical investigations are needed to evaluate the potential for quantum advantage in CO, and we give some possible future directions for such investigations."

The Charge Density Wave (CDW) transition is observed near 110K temperature in all these properties. The Thermoelectric power has been measured from 15K to 300K spanning the incommensurate and commensurate CDW regions. We observed a weak anomaly at the CDW transition for the first time in the specific heat of VSe2. The linear temperature dependence of resistivity and thermoelectric power at higher temperatures suggests a normal metallic behavior and electron-phonon scattering above the CDW transition. The positive thermoelectric power and negative Hall coefficient along with strongly temperature dependent behavior in the CDW phase suggest a mixed conduction related to the strongly hybridized s-p-d bands in this compound."

Using simple kinetic models for gradual freeze out we are able to generate thermal post FO distribution, but only in highly simplified situation. In a more advanced model, taking into account rescattering and re-thermalization, the post FO distribution gets more complicated. The resulting particle distributions are in qualitative agreement with the experimentally measured pion spectra. Our study also shows that the obtained post FO distribution functions, although analytically very different from the Juttner distribution, do look pretty much like thermal distributions in some range of parameters."

We observe a first order transition in the resistivity of the sintered pellets around 160K on cooling. The electronic properties including the transitional hysteresis in the resistance anomaly (from 80K-160K) are found to be very sensitive to the structural details of the samples, which were prepared in different annealing conditions. The thermopower results on the sintered pellets are reported between 10K - 300K. The magnetic measurements between 2K - 300K and up to 14 Tesla field show the absence of any magnetic ordering in Fe0.33VSe2. The magnetic moment per Fe -atom at room temperature (between 1.4 to 1.7 Bohr Magneton) is much lower than in previously reported anti-ferromagnetic FeV2Se4. Furthermore, the Curie constant shows a rapid and continuous reduction and combined with the high field magnetization result at 2K suggests a rapid decrease in the paramagnetic moments on cooling to low temperatures and the absence of any magnetic order in Fe0.33VSe2 at low temperatures."

    "summary": "Thyroid disease instances have been continuously increasing since the 1990s, and thyroid cancer has become the most rapidly rising disease among all the malignancies in recent years. Most existing studies focused on applying deep convolutional neural networks for detecting thyroid cancer. Despite their satisfactory performance on binary classification tasks, limited studies have explored multi-class classification of thyroid disease types; much less is known of the diagnosis of co-existence situation for different types of thyroid diseases. Therefore, this study proposed a novel multi-channel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to address the multi-class classification task of thyroid disease. The multi-channel CNN merits from computed tomography to drive a comprehensive diagnostic decision for the overall thyroid gland, emphasizing the disease co-existence circumstance. Moreover, this study also examined alternative strategies to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of CNN models through concatenation of different scales of feature maps. Benchmarking experiments demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed multi-channel CNN architecture compared with the standard single-channel CNN architecture. More specifically, the multi-channel CNN achieved an accuracy of 0.909, precision of 0.944, recall of 0.896, specificity of 0.994, and F1 of 0.917, in contrast to the single-channel CNN, which obtained 0.902, 0.892, 0.909, 0.993, 0.898, respectively. In addition, the proposed model was evaluated in different gender groups; it reached a diagnostic accuracy of 0.908 for the female group and 0.901 for the male group. Collectively, the results highlight that the proposed multi-channel CNN has excellent generalization and has the potential to be deployed to provide computational decision support in clinical settings."

    "title": "Further improving quantum algorithms for nonlinear differential equations via higher-order methods and rescaling",
    "summary": "The solution of large systems of nonlinear differential equations is needed for many applications in science and engineering. In this study, we present three main improvements to existing quantum algorithms based on the Carleman linearisation technique. First, by using a high-precision technique for the solution of the linearised differential equations, we achieve logarithmic dependence of the complexity on the error and near-linear dependence on time. Second, we demonstrate that a rescaling technique can considerably reduce the cost, which would otherwise be exponential in the Carleman order for a system of ODEs, preventing a quantum speedup for PDEs. Third, we provide improved, tighter bounds on the error of Carleman linearisation. We apply our results to a class of discretised reaction-diffusion equations using higher-order finite differences for spatial resolution. We show that providing a stability criterion independent of the discretisation can conflict with the use of the rescaling due to the difference between the max-norm and 2-norm. An efficient solution may still be provided if the number of discretisation points is limited, as is possible when using higher-order discretisations."

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has emphasized securing access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for all. For climatological and health reasons, particular attention has been focused on expanding the use of renewables for electricity production. In particular, photovoltaics, coupled to energy storage, is an attractive option for dispatchable electricity production, but the degree to which they can be used to address global lack of electricity access, and associated costs, merits more attention. This study presents a global geospatial analysis to identify areas suitable for production of dispatchable electricity using photovoltaics and energy storage. Analysis considers land use restrictions, 25 years of historical hourly solar irradiance, seasonal demand curves, population, and visible nighttime light (as a measure of electrification). We show that nearly all the population identified without electricity access (approx. 1.1 billion people) could get access to Tier 5 level electricity in the Sustainable Energy for All initiative framework using photovoltaics and battery storage coupled systems. Under most cost scenarios analyzed, around 90 percent of this population could be served for a lifetime cost of electricity (LCOE) of 0.20 dollars per kWhe or less at current system costs."

Similarly to the case of a circular n-p junction of monolayer graphene, we find that (i) the wave functions form caustics inside the circular region, and (ii) the shape of these caustics are well described by a geometrical optics model using the concept of a negative refractive index. In contrast to the monolayer case, we show that the strong focusing effect is absent in the bilayer. We explain these findings in terms of the angular dependence of Klein tunneling at a planar n-p junction."

With the availability of stellar databases and far-infrared data from Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) it is possible to compare the optical and infrared properties of dust, and derive the far-infrared emissivity with respect to the optical extinction. In this paper we present the results of a systematic analysis of the FIR emissivity of interstellar clouds observed with ISOPHOT (the photometer onboard ISO) at least at two infrared wavelengths, one close to ~100um and one at 200um. We constructed FIR emission maps, determined dust temperatures, created extinction maps using 2MASS survey data, and calculated far-infrared emissivity for each of these clouds. We present the largest homogeneously reduced database constructed so far for this purpose. During the data analysis special care was taken on possible systematic errors. We find that far-infrared emissivity has a clear dependence on temperature. The emissivity is enhanced by a factor of usually less than 2 in the low dust temperature regime of 12K<=T_d<=14K. This result suggests larger grain sizes in those regions. However, the emissivity increase of typically below 2 restricts the possible grain growth processes to ice-mantle formation and coagulation of silicate grains, and excludes the coagulation of carbonaceous particles on the scales of the regions we investigated. In the temperature range 14K<=T_d<=16K a systematic decrease of emissivity is observed with respect to the values of the diffuse interstellar matter. Possible scenarios for this behaviour are discussed in the paper."

We successfully observed WD 1310+583 on eight nights, and determined 17 significant frequencies by the whole dataset. Seven of them seem to be independent pulsation modes between 634 and 2740 microHz, and we performed preliminary asteroseismic investigations of the star utilizing six of these periods. We also identified three new light variables on the fields of white dwarf candidates: an eclipsing binary, a candidate delta Scuti/beta Cephei and a candidate W UMa-type star."

We investigate such distance spaces over , whose distance functions are differentiable like in case of Finsler spaces. These spaces have several good properties, yet they are no Finsler spaces (which are special distance spaces). They are situated between general metric spaces (distance spaces) and Finsler spaces. We will investigate such curves of differentiable distance spaces, which possess the same properties as geodesics do in Finsler spaces. So these curves can be considered as forerunners of Finsler geodesics. They are in greater plenitude than Finsler geodesics, but they become geodesics in a Finsler space. We show some properties of these curves, as well as some relations between differentiable distance spaces and Finsler spaces. We arrive to these curves and to our results by using distance spheres, and using no variational calculus. We often apply direct geometric considerations."

Here we show that active matter or self-propelled particles interacting with quenched disorder under an external drive represents a new class of system that can also exhibit pinning-depinning phenomena, plastic flow phases, and nonequilibrium sliding transitions that are correlated with distinct morphologies and velocity-force curve signatures. When interactions with the substrate are strong, a homogeneous pinned liquid phase forms that depins plastically into a uniform disordered phase and then dynamically transitions first into a moving stripe coexisting with a pinned liquid and then into a moving phase separated state at higher drives. We numerically map the resulting dynamical phase diagrams as a function of external drive, substrate interaction strength, and self-propulsion correlation length. These phases can be observed for active matter moving through random disorder. Our results indicate that intrinsically nonequilibrium systems can exhibit additional nonequilibrium transitions when subjected to an external drive."

    "summary": "The vanadium-based kagome metals V Sb ( = K, Rb, and Cs) host a superconducting ground state that coexists with an unconventional charge density wave (CDW). The CDW state exhibits experimental signatures of chirality, electronic nematicity, and time-reversal-symmetry-breaking, raising the questions whether the superconductivity (SC) in V Sb may also be unconventional, how SC interplays with CDW, and how the two orders evolve upon tuning. This article reviews studies of the superconducting pairing symmetry, and the tuning of SC and CDW in the V Sb compounds. Various experimental techniques consistently find that CsV Sb exhibits nodeless SC, which remains robust regardless whether the CDW is present. Under hydrostatic pressure, SC in V Sb becomes enhanced as the CDW is gradually suppressed, revealing a competition between the two orders. In CsV Sb , a new CDW state emerges under pressure that competes more strongly with SC relative to the CDW at ambient pressure, and results in two superconducting domes that coexist with CDW. After the CDW in V Sb is fully suppressed with hydrostatic pressure, a further increase in pressure leads to a nonmonotonic evolution of the superconducting transition temperature driven by lattice modulations. Thickness is shown to be a powerful tuning parameter in V Sb thin flakes, revealing the evolution of CDW and SC upon dimensional reduction, and can be combined with hydrostatic pressure to shed light on the interplay between SC and CDW. Based on results reviewed in this article, we discuss outstanding issues to be addressed in the V Sb systems."

    "summary": "A spin-U(1)-symmetry protected momentum-dependent integer- -valued topological invariant is proposed to time-reversal-invariant (TRI) superconductivity (SC) whose nonzero value will lead to exactly flat surface band(s). The theory is applied to the weakly spin-orbit coupled quasi-1D A Cr As (A=Na, K, Rb, Cs) superconductors family with highest up to 8.6 K with -wave pairing in the channel. It's found that up to the leading atomic spin-orbit-coupling (SOC), the whole (001) surface Brillouin zone is covered with exactly-flat surface bands, with some regime hosting three flat bands and the remaining part hosting two. Such exactly-flat surface bands will lead to very sharp zero-bias conductance peak in the scanning tunneling microscopic spectrum. When a tiny subleading spin-flipping SOC is considered, the surface bands will only be slightly split. The application of this theory can be generalized to other unconventional superconductors with weak SOC, particularly to those with mirror-reflection symmetry."

In the far-infrared the current estimates of its surface brightness are based on the measurements of the COBE satellite. Independent confirmation of these results is still needed from other instruments. In this paper we derive estimates of the far-infrared CIRB using measurements made with the ISOPHOT instrument aboard the ISO satellite. The results are used to seek further confirmation of the CIRB levels that have been derived by various groups using the COBE data. We study three regions of very low cirrus emission. The surface brightness observed with the ISOPHOT instrument at 90, 150, and 180 um is correlated with hydrogen 21 cm line data from the Effelsberg radio telescope. Extrapolation to zero hydrogen column density gives an estimate for the sum of extragalactic signal plus zodiacal light. The zodiacal light is subtracted using ISOPHOT data at shorter wavelengths. Thus, the resulting estimate of the far-infrared CIRB is based on ISO measurements alone. In the range 150 to 180 um, we obtain a CIRB value of 1.08+-0.32+-0.30 MJy/sr quoting statistical and systematic errors separately. In the 90 um band, we obtain a 2-sigma upper limit of 2.3 MJy/sr. The estimates derived from ISOPHOT far-infrared maps are consistent with the earlier COBE results."

In particular, from a phase separated cluster state, the disks can spread out and homogeneously cover the substrate in what can be viewed as an example of an active matter wetting transition. We map the location of this transition as a function of activity, disk density, and substrate strength, and we also identify other phases including a cluster state, coexistence between a cluster and a labyrinth wetted phase, and a pinned liquid. These phases can be identified using the cluster size, which dips at the wetting-dewetting transition, and the fraction of sixfold coordinated particles, which drops when dewetting occurs."

Upon cooling from room temperature, the compound undergoes a structural phase transition at K from the rhombohedral space group with the perfect kagome spin network to the monoclinic space group with the distorted kagome planes. The distortion results in three inequivalent exchange interactions among the Cu spins that magnetically order below K. Magnetization measured with a magnetic field applied within the kagome plane reveals small in-plane ferromagnetism resulting from spin canting. On the other hand, the out-of-plane magnetization does not show a clear hysteresis loop of the ferromagnetic component nor a prominent anomaly up to 170 T, with the exception of the subtle knee-like bend around 90 T, which could indicate the 1/3 magnetization plateau. The combined analysis using the irreducible representations of the magnetic space groups and magnetic structure refinement on the neutron powder diffraction data suggests that the magnetic moments order in the magnetic space group with the all-in-all-out spin structure, which by symmetry allows for the in-plane canting, consistent with the in-plane ferromagnetism observed in the magnetization."

We found that varies from field to field with --5.3 --2.1. It depends on the absolute surface brightness and on the hydrogen column density. We also found different spectral indices for the same sky region at different wavelengths. Longer wavelength measurements show steeper power spectra. This can be explained by the presence of dust at various temperatures, in particular of a cold extended component. For the faintest areas of the far-infrared sky we derive a wavelength independent spectral index of = --2.3 0.6 for the cirrus power spectrum. The application of the correct spectral index is a precondition for the proper disentanglement of the cirrus foreground component of the Cosmic Far-Infrared Background and its fluctuations."

This fantastic stability allows us to calibrate all scientific measurements by a fixed and time-independent response file, without using any information from the PACS internal calibration sources. However, the analysis of calibration block observations revealed clear correlations of the internal source signals with the evaporator temperature and a signal drift during the first half hour after the cooler recycling. These effects are small, but can be seen in repeated measurements of standard stars. From our analysis we established corrections for both effects which push the stability of the PACS bolometer response to about 0.2% (stdev) or 2% in the blue, 3% in the green and 5% in the red channel (peak-to-peak). After both corrections we still see a correlation of the signals with PACS FPU temperatures, possibly caused by parasitic heat influences via the Kevlar wires which connect the bolometers with the PACS Focal Plane Unit. No aging effect or degradation of the photometric system during the mission lifetime has been found."

However, their investigations have been mostly limited in nonmagnetic system because of lacking ideal spin-polarized candidates with clean type-II nodal line states.

These type-II nodal lines are different with former proposed examples because they have a 100% spin polarization.

The recent attention brought to sulfur-bearing molecules, as well as the recent detection of carbonic acid (H CO ) in the interstellar medium (ISM), invites the study of the interstellar detection of the sulfur counterpart, thiocarbonic acid. However, the interstellar formation pathways of thiocarbonic acid have remained elusive. In this work, thiocarbonic acid was identified in the gas phase during the temperature programmed desorption (TPD) using isomer-selective single photoionization reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PI-ReToF-MS), suggesting that the hitherto astronomically unobserved thiocarbonic acid represents a promising candidate for future astronomical searches. The formation of H2CS3 isomers was investigated through additional isotopically labeled experiments and the formation mechanisms through quantum chemical studies. These findings unravel a key reaction pathway to thiocarbonic acid and represent a first step toward its possible formation and detection in the ISM, shedding light on the missing sulfur problem."

We find that the ratio of the exchange couplings ranges from 0.32 to , implying a change (crossover or quantum phase transition) in the materials' magnetic properties from one-dimensional (1D) behavior for to two-dimensional (2D) behavior for behavior. For , realized for = 0, 1, and 4, we find a magnetic contribution to the low-temperature specific heat, , consistent with spinon excitations in 1D spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnets. Remarkably, for = 2, where implies a 2D magnatic character, we also observe . This finding, which contrasts the prediction of made by standard spin-wave theories, shows that Fermi-like statistics also plays a significant role for the magnetic excitations in frustrated spin-1/2 2D antiferromagnets."

    "summary": "Nabokoite family compounds ACu (TeO )(SO ) Cl (A=Na, K, Cs, Rb) are candidates for the experimental realization of highly-frustrated 2D square kagome lattice (SKL). Their magnetic subsystem includes SKL layers decorated by additional copper ions. All members of this family are characterized by quite high Curie-Weiss temperatures ( K), but magnetic ordering was reported only for Na and K compounds at a much lower temperatures below 4 K. We report here results of the study of high-frequency ( GHz) dielectric properties of this family of compounds. Our study revealed presence of the strong dielectric anomaly both in the real and imaginary parts of high-frequency dielectric permittivity for Na and K compounds approx. 100 and 26 K, correspondingly, presumably related to antiferroelectric ordering. Additionally, much weaker anomalies were observed at approximately 5K indicating possible interplay of magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom. We discuss possible relation between the structure rearrangements accompanying dielectric anomalies and a delayed magnetic ordering in the nabokoite family compounds."

    "summary": "Aims: An all-sky survey of loop- and arc-like intensity enhancements has been performed in order to investigate the large-scale structure of the diffuse far-infrared emission. Methods: We used maps made of 60 and 100 micrometer processed IRAS data (Sky Survey Atlas and dust infrared emission maps) to identify large-scale structures: loops, arcs or cavities, in the far-infrared emission in the Galaxy. Distances were attributed to a subsample of loops using associated objects. Results: We identified 462 far-infrared loops, analyzed their individual FIR properties and their distribution. This data forms the Catalogue of Far-Infrared Loops in the Galaxy. We obtained observational estimates of f_in~30% and f_out~5% for the hot gas volume filling factor of the inward and outward Galactic neighbourhood of the Solar System. We obtained a slope of the power law size luminosity function beta =1.37 for low Galactic latitudes in the outer Milky Way. Conclusions: Deviations in the celestial distribution of far-infrared loops clearly indicate, that violent events frequently overwrite the structure of the interstellar matter in the inner Galaxy. Our objects trace out the spiral arm structure of the Galaxy in the neighbourhood of the Sun and their distribution clearly suggests that there is an efficient process that can generate loop-like features at high Galactic latitudes. Power law indices of size luminosity distributions suggest, that the structure of the ISM is ruled by supernovae and stellar winds at low Galactic latitudes while it is governed by supersonic turbulence above the Galactic plane."

    "title": "Collective Transport for Active Matter Run and Tumble Disk Systems on a Traveling Wave Substrate",
    "summary": "We numerically examine the transport of an assembly of active run-and-tumble disks interacting with a traveling wave substrate. We show that as a function of substrate strength, wave speed, disk activity, and disk density, a variety of dynamical phases arise that are correlated with the structure and net flux of disks. We find that there is a sharp transition into a state where the disks are only partially coupled to the substrate and form a phase separated cluster state. This transition is associated with a drop in the net disk flux and can occur as a function of the substrate speed, maximum substrate force, disk run time, and disk density. Since variation of the disk activity parameters produces different disk drift rates for a fixed traveling wave speed on the substrate, the system we consider could be used as an efficient method for active matter species separation. Within the cluster phase, we find that in some regimes the motion of the cluster center of mass is in the opposite direction to that of the traveling wave, while when the maximum substrate force is increased, the cluster drifts in the direction of the traveling wave. This suggests that swarming or clustering motion can serve as a method by which an active system can collectively move against an external drift."

Multi-component spectra are obtained. One can see a non-magnetic component due to iron located in the unperturbed Fe-Se sheets responsible for superconductivity. Remaining components are magnetically ordered even at room temperature. There is some magnetically ordered iron in Fe-Se sheets perturbed by presence of the iron vacancies. Additionally, one can see iron dispersed between sheets in the form of magnetically ordered high spin trivalent ions, some clusters of above ions, and in the case of pyridine intercalated compound in the form of alpha-Fe precipitates. Pyridine intercalated sample shows traces of superconductivity in the as-prepared state, while cesium intercalated sample in the as-prepared state does not show any superconductivity. Superconductors with transition temperatures being 40 K and 25 K, respectively, are obtained upon annealing. Annealing leads to removal/ordering of the iron vacancies within Fe-Se sheets, while clusters of alpha-Fe grow in the pyridine intercalated sample."

We study in this work the superconducting instabilities of a representative compound, the newly synthesized KCr As superconductor. Based on inputs from density functional theory calculations, we first construct an effective multi-orbital tight-binding Hamiltonian to model its low-energy band structure. We then employ standard random-phase approximation calculations to investigate the superconducting instabilities of the resultant multi-orbital Hubbard model. We find various pairing symmetries in the phase diagram in different interaction parameter regimes, including the triplet -wave, -wave and singlet -wave pairings. We argue that the singlet -wave pairing, which emerges at intermediate interaction strength, is realized in this material. This singlet pairing is driven by spin-density wave fluctuations enhanced by Fermi-surface nesting. We point out that phase-sensitive measurement can distinguish the -wave pairing in KCr As from the -wave previously proposed for a related compound K Cr As . The -wave pairing in KCr As shall also exhibit a subgap spin resonance mode near the nesting vector, which can be tested by inelastic neutron scattering measurements. Another intriguing property of the -pairing is that it can induce time-reversal invariant topological superconductivity in a semiconductor wire with large Rashba spin-orbit coupling via proximity effect. Our study shall be of general relevance to all superconductors in the family of ACr As (A=K, Rb, Cs)."

Depending on the thickness of the deposited films different phases were formed. At low thickness, stable -FeSi (B20) and metastable [CsCl]-Fe Si (B2) phases were observed. In the latter case, because of the presence of Fe vacancies in the lattice the local symmetry around the iron components was lower than cubic. At larger (12 nm) deposited thickness, stable -FeSi has been formed."

The observations were taken in exceptional weather conditions (0.19 mm precipitable water) with typical system temperatures 950 K at 890 GHz. A bright, bipolar north-south outflow is seen in HDO and CS emission, driven by the embedded massive protostar MM1B. This has allowed, for the first time, a direct comparison of the thermal water in this outflow to the location of water maser emission from prior 22 GHz VLA observations. The maser locations are shown to correspond to the sites along the outflow cavity walls where high velocity gas impacts the surrounding material. We also compare our new observations to prior Herschel HIFI spectral line survey data of this field, detecting an order of magnitude more spectral lines (695 vs 65) in the ALMA data. We focus on the strong detections of the complex organic molecule glycolaldehyde (HC(O)CH OH) in the ALMA data that is not detected in the heavily beam-diluted HIFI spectra.

These systems undergo anomalous charge-density-wave (CDW) transitions at ~80-100 K, resulting in the reconstruction of the Fermi surface from the pristine phase. Although comprehensive investigations of the electronic structure via quantum oscillations (QOs) have been performed on the sister compounds CsV Sb and RbV Sb , a detailed QO study of KV Sb is so far absent. Here, we report the Shubnikov-de Haas QO study in KV Sb . We resolve a large number of new frequencies with the highest frequency of 2202 T (occupying ~54% of the Brillouin zone area in the - plane). The Lifshitz-Kosevich analysis further gives relatively small cyclotron effective masses, and the angular dependence study reveals the two-dimensional nature of the frequencies with a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we compare the QO spectra for all three AV Sb compounds collected under the same conditions, enabling us to point out the similarities and differences across these systems.

We study the optical orientation of electrons and holes in a crystal of the FA Cs PbI Br lead halide perovskite by means of polarized photoluminescence, time-resolved differential reflectivity, and time-resolved Kerr rotation. At the cryogenic temperature of 1.6 K the optical orientation degree measured for continuous-wave excitaton reaches 6% for localized electrons and 2\\% for localized holes. Their contributions are distinguished from each other and from exciton optical orientation through the pronounced Hanle effect in transverse magnetic fields and the polarization recovery effect in longitudinal magnetic fields. The optical orientation degree is highly stable against detuning of the laser photon energy from the band gap by up to 0.25 eV, showing then a gradual decrease for detunings up to 0.9 eV. This evidences the inefficiency of spin relaxation mechanisms for free carriers during their energy relaxation. Spin relaxation for localized electrons and holes is provided by the hyperfine interaction with the nuclear spins. Dynamic polarization of nuclear spins is demonstrated by the Overhauser field reaching 4 mT acting on the electrons and mT acting on the holes. This confirms the specifics of lead halide perovskite semiconductors, where the hole hyperfine interaction with the nuclei considerably exceeds that of the electron."

We derive a two-orbital model for electrons in orbitals by including the effective spin-orbit coupling which arises from the mixing between and orbitals. We show that the model acquires a net antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling once staggered spin and orbital orders occur spontaneously. The staggered orders are accompanied by odd-parity multipoles: magnetic monopole, quadrupoles, and toroidal dipoles. We classify the types of the odd-parity multipoles according to the symmetry of the spin and orbital orders. Furthermore, by computing the ME tensor using the linear response theory, we show that the staggered orders induce a variety of the linear ME responses. We elaborate all possible ME responses for each staggered order, which are useful to identify the order parameter and to detect the odd-parity multipoles by measuring the ME effects. We also elucidate the effect of lowering symmetry by a tetragonal distortion, which leads to richer ME responses. The implications of our results are discussed for transition metal oxides, OsO ( K, Rb, and Cs), in which the order parameters are not fully identified."

We also derive a condition in order that an infinitesimal transformation takes geodesics of a Finsler space into geodesics. This yields a Killing type vector field (Theorem 3). In the last section we present a characterization of the Finsler spaces which are projectively flat in a parameter-preserving manner (Theorem 4), and we show that these spaces over are exactly the Minkowski spaces (Theorems 5 and 6)."

On the other hand, we indicated that a third flow component shows up in the reaction plane as an enhanced emission, which is orthogonal to the directed flow. This is not shadowed by the deflected projectile and target, and shows up at measurable rapidities, . To study the formation of this effect initial stages of relativistic heavy ion collisions are studied. An effective string rope model is presented for heavy ion collisions at RHIC energies. Our model takes into account baryon recoil for both target and projectile, arising from the acceleration of partons in an effective field. The typical field strength (string tension) for RHIC energies is about 5-12 GeV/fm, what allows us to talk about \"string ropes\". The results show that QGP forms a tilted disk, such that the direction of the largest pressure gradient stays in the reaction plane, but deviates from both the beam and the usual transverse flow directions. The produced initial state can be used as an initial condition for further hydrodynamical calculations. Such initial conditions lead to the creation of third flow component. Recent measurements are promising that this effect can be used as a diagnostic tool of the QGP."

Here we argue that similar bursts of high frequency gravitational waves, which we call the fast gravitational wave bursts (FGBs), are generated from axion clumps with the presence of gravitational Chern-Simons (CS) coupling. The typical frequency is half of the axion mass, which in general can range from kHz to GHz.

Here, based on density-functional theory and symmetry analysis, we propose the realization of fully spin-polarized double-Weyl fermions in a family ferromagnetic materials X2RhF6 (X= K, Rb, Cs). These materials have the half-metal ground states, where only the bands from the spin-down channel present near the Fermi energy. The spin-down bands form a pair of triply degenerate nodal points (TDNPs) if spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is not included. Under SOC, one TDNP splits into two double-Weyl points featuring quadratic dispersion along two momentum direction, and they are protected by the three-fold rotation (C3) symmetry. Unlike most double-Weyl semimetals, the Weyl points proposed here have the type-III dispersion with one of the crossing bands being saddle-shaped. An effective model is constructed, which describes well the nature of the Weyl points. These Weyl points are fully spin-polarized, and are characterized with double Fermi arcs on the surface spectrum. Breaking C3 symmetry by lattice strain could shift one double-Weyl point into a pair of type-II single-Weyl points. The X2RhF6 materials proposed here are excellent candidates to investigate the novel properties of type-III double-Weyl fermions in ferromagnetic system, as well as generate potential applications in spintronics."

Lead-based perovskites have emerged as highly efficient, abundantly available, and low-cost materials for such applications but there are two major challenges i.e. chemical instability and the danger of toxic lead leaching that can badly affect both the environment and human health. Therefore, in search of lead-free perovskites, the replacement of lead with eco-friendly elements like bismuth and sodium may be a good strategy. Bismuth has very similar electronic properties as that of lead so it gives very efficient perovskites. Therefore, double perovskites containg Bi element X NaBiCl (X=Cs, Rb, K) are explored here in terms of the structural, opto-electronic , and thermoelectric properties using the first-principles approach.

The DP A2AuScX6 halides were studied for their structural phase stability and optoelectronic properties in order to identify potential materials for energy harvesting systems. The stability criteria were verified by computing the formation energy, binding energy, phonon dispersion curve, stiffness constants, tolerance, and octahedral factors. The electronic band structure, carrier effective mass, density of states (DOS), and charge density distribution were calculated to reveal the nature of electronic conductivity and the chemical bonding nature present within them. For Cs2AuScX6 (Rb2AuScX6) [X = Cl, Br, I], the corresponding values of band gap [using TB-mBJ] are 1.88 (1.93), 1.68 (1.71), and 1.30 (1.32) eV.

In the design of the experiment, only the apparent path of these objects were retrieved from the detectors, i.e. the costs in terms of Kepler pixels were minimized. Because of the faintness of the targets we employ specific reduction techniques and co-added images.

In addition, two spectra of this star separated by ~three years show silicate emission features, indicative of submicron- to micron-sized grains. We argue that such small grains would be rapidly depleted and their presence in both spectra suggests that the production of small dust is continuous over at least on few years timescale. We predict that systems showing variable mid-infrared spectra, if exist, will provide valuable help in distinguishing the possible scenarios proposed for dust replenishment."

    "summary": "Simultaneous optical and ionosonde detections of meteors offer a great opportunity to measure the transient physical properties of the meteor's ionization trail. One of the key parameters of the ionization trail is its true geometric height above the surface of the Earth, which can be determined from the trajectory of the optical meteors by multi-site measurements. During the peak of the 2019 Geminid shower we looked for optical meteors among the Konkoly Meteor Observatory Network data taken at ELTE Gothard Observatory, Szombathely, and contemporaneous meteor signals detected by the DPS-4D type ionosonde (Digisonde) operating at Széchenyi István Geophysical Observatory (SZIGO), Nagycenk, Hungary. From the 2 simultaneous detections we inferred the atmospheric height of the meteors using the method of intersecting planes. The results, about 90 and 85 km, are consistent with the detection limit (above 80 km) of the Digisonde."

    "title": "Evidence for fresh frost layer on the bare nucleus of comet Hale--Bopp at 32 AU distance",
    "summary": "Here we report that the activity of comet Hale--Bopp ceased between late 2007 and March, 2009, at about 28 AU distance from the Sun. At that time the comet resided at a distance from the Sun that exceeded the freeze-out distance of regular comets by an order of magnitude. A Herschel Space Observatory PACS scan was taken in mid-2010, in the already inactive state of the nucleus. The albedo has been found to be surprisingly large (8.1 0.9% ), which exceeds the value known for any other comets. With re-reduction of archive HST images from 1995 and 1996, we confirm that the pre-perihelion albedo resembled that of an ordinary comet, and was smaller by a factor of two than the post-activity albedo. Our further observations with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) also confirmed that the albedo increased significantly by the end of the activity. We explain these observations by proposing gravitational redeposition of icy grains towards the end of the activity. This is plausible for such a massive body in a cold environment, where gas velocity is lowered to the range of the escape velocity. These observations also show that giant comets are not just the upscaled versions of the comets we know but can be affected by processes that are yet to be fully identified."

    "summary": "In the last decade many kinematic groups of young stars (<100 Myr) were discovered in the solar neighbourhood. Since the most interesting period of planet formation overlaps with the age of these groups, their well dated members are attractive targets for exoplanet searches by direct imaging. We combined astrometric, photometric and X-ray data, and applied strict selection criteria to explore the stellar content of five nearby moving groups. We identified more than 100 potential new candidate members in the ß Pic moving group, and in the Tucana-Horologium, Columba, Carina, and Argus associations. In order to further assess and confirm their membership status, we analysed radial velocity data and lithium equivalent widths extracted from high-resolution spectra of 54 candidate stars. We identified 35 new probable/possible young moving group members: 4 in the ß Pic moving group, 11 in the Columba association, 16 in the Carina association, and 4 in the Argus association. We found serendipitiously a new AB Dor moving group member as well. For four Columba systems Hipparcos based parallaxes have already been available and as they are consistent with the predicted kinematic parallaxes, they can be considered as secure new members."

    "summary": "The recently discovered vanadium-based Kagome metals V Sb ( ) are of great interest with the interplay of charge density wave (CDW) order, band topology and superconductivity. In this paper, by identifying elementary band representations (EBRs), we construct a two-EBR graphene-Kagome model to capture the two low-energy van-Hove-singularity dispersions and, more importantly, the nontrivial band topology in these Kagome metals. This model consists of (V- , Kagome sites) and EBRs (Sb1- , honeycomb sites). We have investigated the Fermi surface instability by calculating the electronic susceptibility . Prominent Fermi-surface nesting peaks are obtained at three L points, where the component of the nesting vector shows intimate relationship with the anticrossing point along M--L. The nesting peaks at L are consistent with the CDW reconstruction in these compounds. In addition, the sublattice-resolved bare susceptibility is calculated and similar sharp peaks are observed at the L points, indicating a strong antiferromagnetic fluctuation. Assuming a bulk -wave superconducting pairing, helical surface states and nontrivial superconducting gap are obtained on the (001) surface. In analogous to FeTe Se superconductor, our results establish another material realization of a stoichiometric superconductor with nontrivial band topology, providing a promising platform for studying exotic Majorana physics in condensed matter"

Our study evaluates different relativistic Hamiltonians, assesses basis set and virtual space truncation effects, and examines the role of orbital correlation and relaxation in simulating the spectroscopic observables. The results of this investigation highlight the importance of computing two-electron interactions beyond the zeroth-order truncation (i.e. the Coulomb term) when working in the tender and hard X-ray ranges. Additionally, we compare different structural models using the frozen density embedding method (FDE). By contrasting the bare and embedded uranyl models, we observe significant changes in binding energies, highlighting the influence of the equatorial ligands of the uranyl ion on its spectroscopic observables. A comparison between the embedded uranyl and supermolecular systems, excluding the cesium atoms, reveals systematic differences, with binding energy variations from experimental data remaining within 10 eV. Notably, the computed spin-orbit splittings for U and deviate by less than 0.7 eV, demonstrating the validity of this protocol for computing binding energies in the soft X-ray range."

The overview of these observational types highlights specific topics where substantial improvements and discoveries are expected in the near future."

Despite extensive studies, the three-dimensional (3D) nature of CDW states in these systems remains elusive. This study employs first-principles density functional theory and a tight-binding model to investigate the stacking-dependent electronic structures of 3D CDWs in AV Sb , emphasizing the significant role of interlayer coupling in behaviors of the VHSs associated with diverse 3D CDW orders. We develop a minimal 3D tight-binding model and present a detailed analysis of band structures and density of states for various 3D CDW stacking configurations, including those with and without a -phase shift stacking of the inverse star of David, as well as alternating stacking of the inverse star of David and the star of David. We find that VHSs exist below the Fermi level even in 3D CDWs without -phase shift stackings, and that these VHSs shift downward in the -phase shift stacking CDW structure, stabilizing the -shifted inverse star of David distortions in alternating vanadium layers as the ground state 3D CDW order of AV Sb . Our work provides the electronic origin of 3D CDW orders, paving the way for a deeper understanding of CDWs and superconductivity in AV Sb kagome metals."

In this paper, we study SPS for ARX systems, and establish that the confidence regions are guaranteed to include the true model parameter with exact, user-chosen, probability under mild statistical assumptions, a property that holds true for any finite number of observed input-output data. Furthermore, we prove the strong consistency of the method, that is, as the number of data points increases, the confidence region gets smaller and smaller and will asymptotically almost surely exclude any parameter value different from the true one. In addition, we also show that, asymptotically, the SPS region is included in an ellipsoid which is marginally larger than the confidence ellipsoid obtained from the asymptotic theory of system identification. The results are theoretically proven and illustrated in a simulation example."

    "title": "Multi-Module Modeling of Heavy Ion Reactions and the 3rd Flow Component",
    "summary": "Fluid dynamical calculations with QGP showed a softening of the directed flow while with hadronic matter this effect is absent. On the other hand, we indicated that a third flow component shows up in the reaction plane as an enhanced emission, which is orthogonal to the directed flow. This is not shadowed by the deflected projectile and target, and shows up at measurable rapidities, . To study the formation of this effect initial stages of relativistic heavy ion collisions are studied. An effective string rope model is presented for heavy ion collisions at RHIC energies. Our model takes into account baryon recoil for both target and projectile, arising from the acceleration of partons in an effective field. The typical field strength (string tension) for RHIC energies is about 5-12 GeV/fm, what allows us to talk about \"string ropes\". The results show that QGP forms a tilted disk, such that the direction of the largest pressure gradient stays in the reaction plane, but deviates from both the beam and the usual transverse flow directions. The produced initial state can be used as an initial condition for further hydrodynamical calculations. Such initial conditions lead to the creation of third flow component. Recent measurements are promising that this effect can be used as a diagnostic tool of the QGP. Collective flow is sensitive to the early stages of system evolution. To study the sensitivity of the flow signal, we have calculated flow harmonics from a Blast Wave model, a tilted, ellipsoidally expanding source. We studied recent experimental techniques used for calculation of the Fourier coefficients and pointed out a few possible problems connected to these techniques, which may impair the sensitivity of flow analysis."

Based on new radial velocity data (in some cases supplemented with earlier data available in the literature), these Cepheids have been found to be members in spectroscopic binary systems. V898 Cen turned out to have one of the largest orbital radial velocity amplitude (> 40 km/s) among the known binary Cepheids. The data are insufficient to determine the orbital periods nor other orbital elements for these new spectroscopic binaries. These discoveries corroborate the statement on the high frequency of occurrence of binaries among the classical Cepheids, a fact to be taken into account when calibrating the period-luminosity relationship for Cepheids. We have also compiled all available photometric data that revealed that the pulsation period of AD Pup, the longest period Cepheid in this sample, is continuously increasing with Delta P = 0.004567 d/century, likely to be caused by stellar evolution. The wave-like pattern superimposed on the parabolic O-C graph of AD Pup may well be caused by the light-time effect in the binary system. ST Vel also pulsates with a continuously increasing period. The other four Cepheids are characterised with stable pulsation periods in the last half century."

The heavy quark symmetry at the leading order of expansion enables us to reduce the independent wave functions and establish interesting relations among form factors. Some relations hold for the whole region of momentum transfer. The meson distribution amplitudes up to twist-4 including the contributions from higher conformal spin partial waves and light meson mass corrections are considered. The CKM matrix elements , and are extracted from some relatively well-measured decay channels. A detailed prediction for the branching ratios of heavy to light meson decays is then presented. The resulting predictions for the semileptonic and radiative decay rates of heavy to light mesons ( ) are found to be compatible with the current experimental data and can be tested by more precise experiments at B-factory, LHCb, BEPCII and CLEOc."

In the course of the K2 Mission, the telescope is staring at the plane of the Ecliptic, hence thousands of Solar System bodies cross the K2 fields, usually causing extra noise in the highly accurate photometric data. In this paper we follow the someone's noise is another one's signal principle and investigate the possibility of deriving continuous asteroid light curves, that has been unprecedented to date. In general, we are interested in the photometric precision that the K2 Mission can deliver on moving Solar System bodies. In particular, we investigate space photometric optical light curves of main-belt asteroids. We study the K2 superstamps covering the M35 and Neptune/Nereid fields observed in the long cadence (29.4-min sampling) mode. Asteroid light curves are generated by applying elongated apertures. We use the Lomb-Scargle method to find periodicities due to rotation. We derived K2 light curves of 924 main-belt asteroids in the M35 field, and 96 in the path of Neptune and Nereid. The light curves are quasi-continuous and several days long. K2 observations are sensitive to longer rotational periods than usual ground-based surveys. Rotational periods are derived for 26 main-belt asteroids for the first time. The asteroid sample is dominated by faint (>20 mag) objects. Due to the faintness of the asteroids and the high density of stars in the M35 field, only 4.0% of the asteroids with at least 12 data points show clear periodicities or trend signalling a long rotational period, as opposed to 15.9% in the less crowded Neptune field. We found that the duty cycle of the observations had to reach ~60% in order to successfully recover rotational periods."

For example, many data analysis tasks are often performed in a manual, ad-hoc manner some time after an experiment. In this article we introduce the DELTA framework that facilitates near real-time streaming analysis of big and fast fusion data. By streaming measurement data from fusion experiments to a high-performance compute center, DELTA allows to perform demanding data analysis tasks in between plasma pulses. This article describe the modular and expandable software architecture of DELTA and presents performance benchmarks of its individual components as well as of entire workflows. Our focus is on the streaming analysis of ECEi data measured at KSTAR on NERSCs supercomputers and we routinely achieve data transfer rates of about 500 Megabyte per second. We show that a demanding turbulence analysis workload can be distributed among multiple GPUs and executes in under 5 minutes. We further discuss how DELTA uses modern database systems and container orchestration services to provide web-based real-time data visualization. For the case of ECEi data we demonstrate how data visualizations can be augmented with outputs from machine learning models. By providing session leaders and physics operators results of higher order data analysis using live visualization they may monitor the evolution of a long-pulse discharge in near real-time and may make more informed decision on how to configure the machine for the next shot."

This is the first analysis in which the physical properties of objects in the outer resonances are determined for a notable sample. In addition to the results for individual objects, we have compared these characteristics with the bulk properties of other populations of the transneptunian region. The newly analyzed objects show a large variety of beaming factors, indicating a diversity of thermal properties, and in general, they follow the albedo-colour clustering identified earlier for Kuiper belt objects and Centaurs, further strengthening the evidence for a compositional discontinuity in the young Solar System."

There exists a noticeable need for research on the CS between English and Korean. We highlight that the current Equivalence Constraint (EC) theory for CS in other languages may only partially capture English-Korean CS complexities due to the intrinsic grammatical differences between the languages. We introduce a novel Koglish dataset tailored for English-Korean CS scenarios to mitigate such challenges. First, we constructed the Koglish-GLUE dataset to demonstrate the importance and need for CS datasets in various tasks. We found the differential outcomes of various foundation multilingual language models when trained on a monolingual versus a CS dataset. Motivated by this, we hypothesized that SimCSE, which has shown strengths in monolingual sentence embedding, would have limitations in CS scenarios. We construct a novel Koglish-NLI (Natural Language Inference) dataset using a CS augmentation-based approach to verify this. From this CS-augmented dataset Koglish-NLI, we propose a unified contrastive learning and augmentation method for code-switched embeddings, ConCSE, highlighting the semantics of CS sentences. Experimental results validate the proposed ConCSE with an average performance enhancement of 1.77\\% on the Koglish-STS(Semantic Textual Similarity) tasks."

    "summary": "The Special Collection of papers in this issue of Astrobiology provide an overview of the characteristics and potential for future exploration of the Ojos del Salado volcano, located in the Andes Mountains in front of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. The main benefits of this site compared with others are the combination of strong UV radiation, the presence of permafrost, and geothermal activity within a dry terrain. The interaction between limited snow events and wind results in snow patches buried under a dry soil surface. This leads to ephemeral water streams that only flow duringdaytime hours. On this volcano, which has the highest located subsurface temperature monitoring systems reported to date, seasonal melting of the permafrost is followed by fast percolation events. This is due to the high porosity of these soils. The results are landforms that shaped by the strong winds. At this site, both thermal springs and lakes (the latter arising from melting ice) provide habitats for life; a 6480m high lake heated by volcanic activity shows both warm and cold sediments that contain a number of different microbial species, including psychrophiles. Where the permafrost melts, thawing ponds have formed at 5900m that is dominated by populations of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, while in the pond sediments and the permafrost itself Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Patescibacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia are abundant. In turn, fumaroles show the presence of acidophilic iron-oxidizers and iron-reducing species. In spite of the extreme conditions reported at Ojos del Salado, this site is easily accessible."

The trigger mechanism of EXor outbursts is still debated. One theory requires a close (sub)stellar companion that perturbs the inner disk and triggers the onset of the outburst. Here, we study the radial velocity (RV) variations of EX Lup, the prototype of EXors. We conducted a 5-year RV survey with HARPS and FEROS. We analyzed the activity of EX Lup by checking the bisector and several other activity indicators. We complemented the RV data with photometric monitoring to look for signatures of activity or varying accretion. We found that the RV of EX Lup is periodic, with stable period, semi-amplitude, and phase over at least four years of observations. This period is not present in any of the activity indicators. However, the RV of narrow metallic emission lines suggest the same period, but with an anti-correlating phase. The observed absorption line RVs can be fitted with a Keplerian solution around a 0.6 M_Sun central star with M2 sin i = (14.7 +/- 0.7) M_Jup and eccentricity of e = 0.24. Alternatively, we attempted to model the observations with a cold/hot stellar spot as well, but the spot parameters needed to reproduce the RV semi-amplitude are in contradiction with the photometric variability, making the spot scenario unlikely. We discuss two possibilities to explain the RV data: a geometry with two accretion columns rotating with the star, and a single accretion flow synchronized with the orbital motion of the hypothetical companion. In the companion scenario, the companion's mass would fall into the brown dwarf desert, which, together with the unusually small separation would make EX Lup a unique binary system, with interesting implications on the physical mechanisms responsible for triggering the outburst."

This set of objects has been monitored during Campaign 6 and represents a nearly unbiased subsample of the population of small Solar System bodies. We derived precise periods and amplitudes for all Trojans, and found their distributions to be compatible with the previous statistics. We point out, however, that ground-based rotation periods are often unreliable above 20h, and we find an overabundance of rotation periods above 60h compared with other minor planet populations. From amplitude analysis we derive a rate of binarity of 20 5%. Our spin rate distribution confirms the previously obtained spin barrier of ~5h and the corresponding ~0.5 g cm cometary-like density limit, also suggesting a high internal porosity for Jovian Trojans. One of our targets, asteroid 65227 exhibits a double rotation period, which can either be due to binarity or the outcome of a recent collision."

In order to explore the YSO population of the Milky Way, we combined the DR2 database with WISE and Planck measurements and made an all-sky probabilistic catalogue of YSOs using machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, or Neural Networks. Our input catalogue contains 103 million objects from the DR2xAllWISE cross-match table. We classified each object into four main classes: YSOs, extragalactic objects, main-sequence stars and evolved stars. At a 90% probability threshold we identified 1,129,295 YSO candidates. To demonstrate the quality and potential of our YSO catalogue, here we present two applications of it. (1) We explore the 3D structure of the Orion A star forming complex and show that the spatial distribution of the YSOs classified by our procedure is in agreement with recent results from the literature. (2) We use our catalogue to classify published Science Alerts. As measures the sources at multiple epochs, it can efficiently discover transient events, including sudden brightness changes of YSOs caused by dynamic processes of their circumstellar disk. However, in many cases the physical nature of the published alert sources are not known. A cross-check with our new catalogue shows that about 30% more of the published alerts can most likely be attributed to YSO activity. The catalogue can be also useful to identify YSOs among future alerts."

Interestingly, the debris disk around the young main-sequence star 49 Ceti possesses a substantial amount of molecular gas, and possibly represents the missing link between the two phases. Motivated to understand the evolution of the gas component in circumstellar disks via finding more 49 Ceti-like systems, we carried out a CO J=3-2 survey with Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment, targeting 20 infrared-luminous debris disks. These systems fill the gap between primordial and old tenuous debris disks in terms of fractional luminosity. Here we report on the discovery of a second 49 Ceti-like disk around the 30 Myr old A3-type star HD21997, a member of the Columba Association. This system was also detected in the CO(2-1) transition, and the reliable age determination makes it an even clearer example of an old gas-bearing disk than 49 Ceti. While the fractional luminosities of HD21997 and 49 Ceti are not particularly high, these objects seem to harbor the most extended disks within our sample. The double-peaked profiles of HD21997 were reproduced by a Keplerian disk model combined with the LIME radiative transfer code. Based on their similarities, 49 Ceti and HD21997 may be the first representatives of a so far undefined new class of relatively old (>~8 Myr), gaseous dust disks. From our results, neither primordial origin nor steady secondary production from icy planetesimals can unequivocally explain the presence of CO gas in the disk of HD21997."

    "title": "Efficient algorithms for robust recovery of images from compressed data",
    "summary": "Compressed sensing (CS) is an important theory for sub-Nyquist sampling and recovery of compressible data. Recently, it has been extended by Pham and Venkatesh to cope with the case where corruption to the CS data is modeled as impulsive noise. The new formulation, termed as robust CS, combines robust statistics and CS into a single framework to suppress outliers in the CS recovery. To solve the newly formulated robust CS problem, Pham and Venkatesh suggested a scheme that iteratively solves a number of CS problems, the solutions from which converge to the true robust compressed sensing solution. However, this scheme is rather inefficient as it has to use existing CS solvers as a proxy. To overcome limitation with the original robust CS algorithm, we propose to solve the robust CS problem directly in this paper and drive more computationally efficient algorithms by following latest advances in large-scale convex optimization for non-smooth regularization. Furthermore, we also extend the robust CS formulation to various settings, including additional affine constraints, -norm loss function, mixed-norm regularization, and multi-tasking, so as to further improve robust CS. We also derive simple but effective algorithms to solve these extensions. We demonstrate that the new algorithms provide much better computational advantage over the original robust CS formulation, and effectively solve more sophisticated extensions where the original methods simply cannot. We demonstrate the usefulness of the extensions on several CS imaging tasks."

Designing a CS-ASR system has many challenges, mainly due to data scarcity, grammatical structure complexity, and domain mismatch. The most common method for addressing CS is to train an ASR system with the available transcribed CS speech, along with monolingual data. In this work, we propose a zero-shot learning methodology for CS-ASR by augmenting the monolingual data with artificially generating CS text. We based our approach on random lexical replacements and Equivalence Constraint (EC) while exploiting aligned translation pairs to generate random and grammatically valid CS content. Our empirical results show a 65.5% relative reduction in language model perplexity, and 7.7% in ASR WER on two ecologically valid CS test sets. The human evaluation of the generated text using EC suggests that more than 80% is of adequate quality."

Empirical results highlight up to 34.4% and 16.2% relative reductions in Mixed-Error Rate and Word-Error Rate for in-domain and zero-shot scenarios, respectively. Lastly, we demonstrate that CS augmentation bolsters the model's code-switching inclination and reduces its monolingual bias."

FePd, CoPd and their Co(Fe)Pt counterparts very attractive candidate for such purposes. The magnetic properties of these films are largely dependent on the orientation and local distribution of the L10 FePd phase fraction which are mainly controlled by diffusion processes and involve diffusion paths of a few angstroms. Highly ordered as well as disordered epitaxial isotope-periodic 57FePd/natFePd (001) thin films were prepared by molecular-beam epitaxy on MgO(001) substrate. Short range diffusion of different phases in FePd thin film induced by room temperature 130 keV He+ irradiation was investigated at fluences up to 30 1015 ions/cm2. Conversion electron Mössbauer spectroscopy and synchrotron Mössbauer reflectivity experiments showed that the inter-atomic diffusion across 57FePd/natFePd interface occur mainly via the iron rich regions. The ratio of the diffusion length in the L10, fcc and iron rich structure are 1:1.4:5.6 respectively. Assuming that the diffusion coefficient in the fcc phase is between the diffusion coefficient of the L10 phase in the crystallographic c direction and perpendicular to it, the diffusion coefficient in the c-direction of the L10 phase is found more than 1.9 times lower than in the a-b plane."

    "title": "Conditioning LLMs to Generate Code-Switched Text",
    "summary": "Code-switching (CS) is still a critical challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to interpret and generate code-switched text, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale CS datasets for training. This paper presents a novel methodology to generate CS data using LLMs, and test it on the English-Spanish language pair. We propose back-translating natural CS sentences into monolingual English, and using the resulting parallel corpus to fine-tune LLMs to turn monolingual sentences into CS. Unlike previous approaches to CS generation, our methodology uses natural CS data as a starting point, allowing models to learn its natural distribution beyond grammatical patterns. We thoroughly analyse the models' performance through a study on human preferences, a qualitative error analysis and an evaluation with popular automatic metrics. Results show that our methodology generates fluent code-switched text, expanding research opportunities in CS communication, and that traditional metrics do not correlate with human judgement when assessing the quality of the generated CS data. We release our code and generated dataset under a CC-BY-NC-SA license."

    "summary": "We propose a generalization of the recently developed system identification method called Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS). The proposed construction is based on the instrumental variables estimate and, unlike the original SPS, it can construct non-asymptotic confidence regions for linear regression models where the regressors contain past values of the output. Hence, it is applicable to ARX systems, as well as systems with feedback. We show that this approach provides regions with exact confidence under weak assumptions, i.e., the true parameter is included in the regions with a (user-chosen) exact probability for any finite sample. The paper also proves the strong consistency of the method and proposes a computationally efficient generalization of the previously proposed ellipsoidal outer-approximation. Finally, the new method is demonstrated through numerical experiments, using both real-world and simulated data."

    "summary": "The success in designing Code-Switching (CS) ASR often depends on the availability of the transcribed CS resources. Such dependency harms the development of ASR in low-resourced languages such as Bengali and Hindi. In this paper, we exploit the transfer learning approach to design End-to-End (E2E) CS ASR systems for the two low-resourced language pairs using different monolingual speech data and a small set of noisy CS data. We trained the CS-ASR, following two steps: (i) building a robust bilingual ASR system using a convolution-augmented transformer (Conformer) based acoustic model and n-gram language model, and (ii) fine-tuned the entire E2E ASR with limited noisy CS data. We tested our method on MUCS 2021 challenge and achieved 3rd place in the CS track. We then tested the proposed method using noisy CS data released for Hindi-English and Bengali-English pairs in Multilingual and Code-Switching ASR Challenges for Low Resource Indian Languages (MUCS 2021) and achieved 3rd place in the CS track. Unlike, the leading two systems that benefited from crawling YouTube and learning transliteration pairs, our proposed transfer learning approach focused on using only the limited CS data with no data-cleaning or data re-segmentation. Our approach achieved 14.1% relative gain in word error rate (WER) in Hindi-English and 27.1% in Bengali-English. We provide detailed guidelines on the steps to finetune the self-attention based model for limited data for ASR. Moreover, we release the code and recipe used in this paper."

    "summary": "X-ray spectroscopies, by their high selectivity and sensitivity to the chemical environment around the atoms probed, provide significant insight into the electronic structure of molecules and materials. Interpreting experimental results requires reliable theoretical models, accounting for environment, relativistic, electron correlation, and orbital relaxation effects in a balanced manner. In this work, we present a protocol for the simulation of core excited spectra with damped response time-dependent density functional theory based on the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian (4c-DR-TD-DFT), in which environment effects are accounted for through the frozen density embedding (FDE) method. We showcase this approach for the uranium M -, L -edge and oxygen K-edge of uranyl tetrachloride (UO Cl ) unit as found in a host Cs UO Cl crystal. We have found that the 4c-DR-TD-DFT simulations yield excitation spectra that very closely match the experiment for the uranium M - and oxygen K-edges, with good agreement for the broad experimental spectra for the L -edge. By decomposing the complex polarizability in terms of its components we have been able to correlate our results with angle-resolved spectra. We have observed that for all edges, but in particular the uranium M -edge, an embedded model in which the chloride ligands are replaced by an embedding potential, reproduces rather well the spectral profile obtained for UO Cl . Our results underscore the importance of the equatorial ligands to simulating core spectra at both uranium and oxygen edges."

    "summary": "Layered Zintl compounds exhibit significant tunability of thermoelectric (TE) parameters facilitated by their multiple elemental combinations and flexibility in stacking order within the layers. In this work, the effect of stacking order on TE properties of theoretically predicted layered Zintl compounds XZnBi (X = Rb, Cs) is studied using 1st-principles calculations and Boltzmann equations. The materials are semiconductors having moderate band gaps ranging from 0.44 to 0.52 eV. There exist six identical hole pockets for valence band maxima due to the crystal symmetry. This leads to high band degeneracy but simultaneously promotes intervalley scatterings. While as for conduction bands, the Fermi surface consists of a single but highly anisotropic, quasi-two dimensional electron pockets with cylindrical shape along z-axis. This kind of Fermi surface is a characteristic of a pudding mold band shape. It facilitates a unique combination of heavy and light electron masses, simultaneously optimizing Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity. At first, electronic transport coefficients are calculated using constant relaxation time approximation (CRTA) or electron-phonon coupling matrix elements (el-ph). The calculated relaxation times are then integrated with transport results to get the realistic values of TE parameters. The analysis of three-phonon scattering reveals low thermal conductivity ( ) below 2 W/m/K in these compounds. The also depends on stacking order with the values of nearly half in AB stacking as compared to that of AA stacking. These combined factors lead to a high ZT at 900 K, reaching to a maximum of 2.42 using CRTA and 0.52 when el-ph are included. The study highlights the potential of XZnBi systems as promising TE materials as well as the critical roles of stacking and el-ph in accurately evaluating TE properties."

    "summary": "Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system for the deaf or hearing impaired people. It combines lip movements with hand cues to obtain a complete phonetic repertoire. Current deep learning based methods on automatic CS recognition suffer from a common problem, which is the data scarcity. Until now, there are only two public single speaker datasets for French (238 sentences) and British English (97 sentences). In this work, we propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation method with teacher-student structure, which transfers audio speech information to CS to overcome the limited data problem. Firstly, we pretrain a teacher model for CS recognition with a large amount of open source audio speech data, and simultaneously pretrain the feature extractors for lips and hands using CS data. Then, we distill the knowledge from teacher model to the student model with frame-level and sequence-level distillation strategies. Importantly, for frame-level, we exploit multi-task learning to weigh losses automatically, to obtain the balance coefficient. Besides, we establish a five-speaker British English CS dataset for the first time. The proposed method is evaluated on French and British English CS datasets, showing superior CS recognition performance to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by a large margin."

Data were taken on eight nights in February and December 2002 with a total time span of ~57 hours. Almost 1000 individual V-band frames were examined to find short-period variable stars. We discovered six new variable stars, of which one is a promising candidate for an eclipsing binary with a pulsating component. Two stars were classified as delta Scuti stars and one as Algol-type eclipsing binary. Two stars are slow variables with ambiguous classification. From absolute VRI photometry we have estimated the main characteristics of the cluster: m-M=11.0+/-0.5, E(V-I)=0.4+/-0.1, E(V-R)=0.08+/-0.06 (E(B-V)=0.2+/-0.15) and d=1.3+/-0.6 kpc.

    "summary": "Adiabatic quantum computing is a general framework for preparing eigenstates of Hamiltonians on quantum devices. However, its digital implementation requires an efficient Hamiltonian simulation subroutine, which may introduce extra computational overhead or complicated quantum control logic. In this work, we show that the time step sizes in time discretization can be much larger than expected, and the overall complexity is greatly reduced. Remarkably, regardless of the general convergence order of the numerical method, we can choose a uniform time step size independent of tolerated error and evolution time for sufficiently accurate simulation. Furthermore, with the boundary cancellation condition where the continuous diabatic errors are exponentially suppressed, we provide strong evidence on an exponential convergence of even first-order Trotter with uniform time step size. We apply our analysis to the example of adiabatic unstructured search and show several preferable features of the Trotterized adiabatic approach: it can match the Grover lower bound, it does not require a priori knowledge on the number of marked states, and its performance can be asymptotically comparable with that of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm."

We illustrate the advantages (e.g., rigorous faithfulness guarantee, lower computational complexity, higher statistical power, and much more flexibility in a wide range of applications) of our conditional CS divergence over previous proposals, such as the conditional KL divergence and the conditional maximum mean discrepancy. We also demonstrate the compelling performance of conditional CS divergence in two machine learning tasks related to time series data and sequential inference, namely time series clustering and uncertainty-guided exploration for sequential decision making.

We also avoid a phase transition in the equation of state, and we let the matter supercool during the expansion. Then central Pb+Pb collisions at TeV are studied in an almost perfect fluid dynamical model, with azimuthally symmetric initial state generated in a dynamical flux-tube model. The general development of thermodynamical extensives are also shown for lower energies. We observe considerable deviations from a thermal equilibrium source as a consequence of the fluid dynamical expansion arising from a least fluctuating initial state."

The superstamp offered the possibility to obtain precise, uninterrupted light curves of a large number of MBAs and thus to determine unambiguous rotation rates for them. We obtained photometry for 608 MBAs, and were able to determine or estimate rotation rates for 90 targets, of which 86 had no known values before. In an additional 16 targets we detected incomplete cycles and/or eclipse-like events. We found the median rotation rate to be significantly longer than that of the ground-based observations indicating that the latter are biased towards shorter rotation rates. Our study highlights the need and benefits of further continuous photometry of asteroids."

We present new multi-band JVLA-imaging covering 1 to 6 GHz and reaching an angular resolution of up to (a 6-fold improvement over existing radio data). We confirm the previous detection of a spatially extended radio component around the quasar indicating that there is on-going star formation activity in the quasar host galaxy. For the first time, we directly detect a jet-like bipolar outflow from the quasar aligned with its companion star-forming galaxy (SFG) and several blobs of ionized gas in its vicinity identified in previous studies. Within the companion SFG we find evidence for a flattening of the synchrotron spectral index towards the point of intersection with the jet axis, further suggesting that the outflow may actually be impacting its interstellar medium (ISM). We discuss two possible mechanisms that could have triggered the starburst in the companion SFG: a wet-dry merger with the quasar and jet-induced star formation. While triggering through interaction-driven gas dynamics cannot be excluded with current data, our new observations make HE0450-2958 a strong candidate for jet-induced star formation, and one of the rare links between local systems (like Minkowski's Object or Centaurus A) and the high-z regime where radio-optical alignments suggest that this phenomenon could be more common."

This extends the energy detector to allow for detecting transmission opportunities even if the band is already energy filled. We show that the task described above is not performed efficiently by regular MIMO decoders (such as MMSE decoder) due to possible sparsity in the transmit signal. Since CS reconstruction tools take into account the sparsity order of the signal, they are more efficient in detecting the activity of the users. Building on successful activity detection by the CS detector, we show that the use of a CS-aided MMSE decoders yields better performance rather than using either CS-based or MMSE decoders separately. Simulations are conducted to verify the gains from using CS detector for Primary user activity detection and the performance gain in using CS-aided MMSE decoders for decoding the PU information for future relaying."

Atomic diffusion governs the structural relaxation and associated changes in the physical and magnetic properties in these alloys. Such processes involve diffusion paths of a few angstroms. In developing modern storage devices it is indispensable to understand these processes. Neutron reflectometry (NR) and Synchrotron Mössbauer Reflectometry (SMR) are suitable non destructive methods to study self-diffusion in a chemically homogenous isotope multilayer with diffusion lengths of the order of a few angstroms. From the diffusion parameters obtained from NR and SMR evaluation we determined activation energies (Q) and preexponent factors (D0) for the distinct environment in the FePd samples. We obtained the highest activation energy (1.82 0.38 eV)and lowest preexponential factor((5.76 0.35)*10-14 m2/s) for the ordered L10 as oppose to the iron rich regions were the activation energy (1.48 0.26 ) found to be lowest and the preexponential factor the highest ((1.01 0.61)*10-13 m2/s)."

    "summary": "Code-switching (CS) detection refers to the automatic detection of language switches in code-mixed utterances. This task can be achieved by using a CS automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can handle such language switches. In our previous work, we have investigated the code-switching detection performance of the Frisian-Dutch CS ASR system by using the time alignment of the most likely hypothesis and found that this technique suffers from over-switching due to numerous very short spurious language switches. In this paper, we propose a novel method for CS detection aiming to remedy this shortcoming by using the language posteriors which are the sum of the frame-level posteriors of phones belonging to the same language. The CS ASR-generated language posteriors contain more complete language-specific information on frame level compared to the time alignment of the ASR output. Hence, it is expected to yield more accurate and robust CS detection. The CS detection experiments demonstrate that the proposed language posterior-based approach provides higher detection accuracy than the baseline system in terms of equal error rate. Moreover, a detailed CS detection error analysis reveals that using language posteriors reduces the false alarms and results in more robust CS detection."

Additionally, it is important for CS students to learn how to learn about new technologies, since change is constant in the CS field. CS curriculum changes happen much slower than the pace of technology adoption. As new technologies are introduced, CS faculty and students often learn together, especially in smaller CS programs.

Inspired by efforts to value human agency alongside productivity, we discuss the benefits of solving Citizen Science (CS) tasks with Hybrid Intelligence (HI), a synergetic mixture of human and artificial intelligence. Currently there is no clear framework or methodology on how to create such an effective mixture. Due to the unique participant-centered set of values and the abundance of tasks drawing upon both human common sense and complex 21st century skills, we believe that the field of CS offers an invaluable testbed for the development of HI and human-centered AI of the 21st century, while benefiting CS as well. In order to investigate this potential, we first relate CS to adjacent computational disciplines. Then, we demonstrate that CS projects can be grouped according to their potential for HI-enhancement by examining two key dimensions: the level of digitization and the amount of knowledge or experience required for participation. Finally, we propose a framework for types of human-AI interaction in CS based on established criteria of HI. This \"HI lens\" provides the CS community with an overview of several ways to utilize the combination of AI and human intelligence in their projects.

    "summary": "Investigating period changes of classical Cepheids through the framework of diagrams provides a unique insight to the evolution and nature of these variable stars. In this work, the new or extended diagrams for 148 Galactic classical Cepheids are presented. By correlating the calculated period change rates with the Gaia EDR3 colours, we obtain observational indications for the non-negligible dependence of the period change rate on the horizontal position within the instability strip. We find period fluctuations in 59 Cepheids with a confidence level of 99%, which are distributed uniformly over the inspected period range. Correlating the fluctuation amplitude with the pulsation period yields a clear dependence, similar to the one valid for longer period pulsating variable stars. The non-negligible amount of Cepheids showing changes in their diagrams that are not or not only of evolutionary origin points toward the need for further studies for the complete understanding of these effects. One such peculiar behaviour is the large amplitude period fluctuation in short period Cepheids, which occurs in a significant fraction of the investigated stars. The period dependence of the fluctuation strength and its minimum at the bump Cepheid region suggests a stability enhancing mechanism for this period range, which agrees with current pulsation models."

The Shannon's sampling theorem states that to recover a signal, the sampling rate must be as least the Nyquist rate. Compressed sensing (CS) is based on the surprising fact that to recover a signal that is sparse in certain representations, one can sample at the rate far below the Nyquist rate. Since its inception in 2006, CS attracted much interest in the research community and found wide-ranging applications from astronomy, biology, communications, image and video processing, medicine, to radar. CS also found successful applications in communications networks. CS was applied in the detection and estimation of wireless signals, source coding, multi-access channels, data collection in sensor networks, and network monitoring, etc. In many cases, CS was shown to bring performance gains on the order of 10X. We believe this is just the beginning of CS applications in communications networks, and the future will see even more fruitful applications of CS in our field."

We show that clustering and principal component analysis allow for a significant dimension reduction with limited loss of information. The most important features are related to geographical location. In particular, we observe that most people spend most of their time at only a few locations. With the help of clustering methods, we then robustly identify home and office locations and compare the results with official census data. Finally, we analyze the geographic spread of users' frequent locations and show that commuting distances can be reasonably well explained by a gravity model."

We show that our ST architectures, and especially our bidirectional end-to-end architecture, perform well on CS speech, even when no CS training data is used."

A mass function of GMCs in NGC 1068 has been obtained for the first time at 100 pc resolution. We find the slope of the mass function for a mass range of . This is shallower than the GMCs in the disk regions of the Milky Way, M51 and NGC 300. Further, we find that the high mass cut-off of the GMC mass function occurs at , which is an order of magnitude larger than that in the nuclear bar region of M51, indicating that the more massive clouds dominate the mass budget in NGC 1068. The observed C O)/ CO intensity ratios are found to be fairly uniform (0.27 0.05) among the identified GMCs. In contrast, the CH OH/ CO ratios exhibit striking spatial variation across the disk, with the smallest values around the bar-end ( 0.03), and larger ratios along the spiral arms ( 0.1-0.2). We find that GMCs with detectable methanol emission tend to have systematically larger velocity widths than those without methanol emission, suggesting that (relatively weak) shocks are responsible for the enhancement of the CH OH/ CO ratios of GMCs in the disk of NGC 1068."

    "summary": "In this paper we present an analysis of Kepler K2 mission Campaign 3 observations of the irregular Neptune satellite, Nereid. We determined a rotation period of P=11.594(+/-)0.017 h and amplitude of dm=0.0328(+/-)00018, confirming previous short rotation periods obtained in ground based observations. The similarities of light curve amplitudes between 2001 and 2015 show that Nereid is in a low-amplitude rotation state nowadays and it could have been in a high-amplitude rotation state in the mid 1960's. Another high-amplitude period is expected in about 30 years. Based on the light curve amplitudes observed in the last 15 years we could constrain the shape of Nereid and obtained a maximum a:c axis ratio of 1.3:1. This excludes the previously suggested very elongated shape of a:c=1.9:1 and clearly shows that Nereid's spin axis cannot be in forced precession due to tidal forces. Thermal emission data from the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Herschel Space Observatory indicate that Nereid's shape is actually close to the a:c axis ratio limit of 1.3:1 we obtained, and it has a very rough, highly cratered surface"

    "title": "Analyzing the State of Computer Science Research with the DBLP Discovery Dataset",
    "summary": "The number of scientific publications continues to rise exponentially, especially in Computer Science (CS). However, current solutions to analyze those publications restrict access behind a paywall, offer no features for visual analysis, limit access to their data, only focus on niches or sub-fields, and/or are not flexible and modular enough to be transferred to other datasets. In this thesis, we conduct a scientometric analysis to uncover the implicit patterns hidden in CS metadata and to determine the state of CS research. Specifically, we investigate trends of the quantity, impact, and topics for authors, venues, document types (conferences vs. journals), and fields of study (compared to, e.g., medicine). To achieve this we introduce the CS-Insights system, an interactive web application to analyze CS publications with various dashboards, filters, and visualizations. The data underlying this system is the DBLP Discovery Dataset (D3), which contains metadata from 5 million CS publications. Both D3 and CS-Insights are open-access, and CS-Insights can be easily adapted to other datasets in the future. The most interesting findings of our scientometric analysis include that i) there has been a stark increase in publications, authors, and venues in the last two decades, ii) many authors only recently joined the field, iii) the most cited authors and venues focus on computer vision and pattern recognition, while the most productive prefer engineering-related topics, iv) the preference of researchers to publish in conferences over journals dwindles, v) on average, journal articles receive twice as many citations compared to conference papers, but the contrast is much smaller for the most cited conferences and journals, and vi) journals also get more citations in all other investigated fields of study, while only CS and engineering publish more in conferences than journals."

    "title": "Herschel survey of brown dwarf disks in Rho Ophiuchi",
    "summary": "Recent observations of the Rho Ophiuchi cluster with the Herschel Space Observatory allow us to probe the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the brown dwarf population in the far-IR, where the disk emission peaks. We performed aperture photometry at 70, 100, and 160 micron, and constructed SEDs for all previously known brown dwarfs detected. These were complemented with ancillary photometry at shorter wavelengths. We compared the observed SEDs to a grid of synthetic disks produced with the radiative transfer code MCFOST, and used the relative figure of merit estimated from the Bayesian inference of each disk parameter to analyse the structural properties. We detected 12 Class II brown dwarfs with Herschel, which corresponds to one-third of all currently known brown dwarf members of Rho Ophiuchi. We do not detect any of the known Class III brown dwarfs. Comparison to models reveals that the disks are best described by an inner radius between 0.01 and 0.07 AU, and a flared disk geometry with a flaring index between 1.05 and 1.2. Furthermore, we can exclude values of the disk scale-height lower than 10 AU (measured at a fiducial radius of 100 AU). We combined the Herschel data with recent ALMA observations of the brown dwarf GY92 204 (ISO-Oph 102), and by comparing its SED to the same grid of disk models, we derived an inner disk radius of 0.035 AU, a scale height of 15 AU with a flaring index of beta~1.15, an exponent for dust settling of -1.5, and a disk mass of 0.001 MSun. This corresponds to a disk-to-central object mass ratio of ~1%. The structural parameters constrained by the extended SED coverage (inner radius and flaring index) show a narrow distribution for the 11 young brown dwarfs detected in Rho Ophiuchi, suggesting that these objects share the same disk evolution and, perhaps, formation."

    "title": "Multi-Graph Decoding for Code-Switching ASR",
    "summary": "In the FAME! Project, a code-switching (CS) automatic speech recognition (ASR) system for Frisian-Dutch speech is developed that can accurately transcribe the local broadcaster's bilingual archives with CS speech. This archive contains recordings with monolingual Frisian and Dutch speech segments as well as Frisian-Dutch CS speech, hence the recognition performance on monolingual segments is also vital for accurate transcriptions. In this work, we propose a multi-graph decoding and rescoring strategy using bilingual and monolingual graphs together with a unified acoustic model for CS ASR. The proposed decoding scheme gives the freedom to design and employ alternative search spaces for each (monolingual or bilingual) recognition task and enables the effective use of monolingual resources of the high-resourced mixed language in low-resourced CS scenarios. In our scenario, Dutch is the high-resourced and Frisian is the low-resourced language. We therefore use additional monolingual Dutch text resources to improve the Dutch language model (LM) and compare the performance of single- and multi-graph CS ASR systems on Dutch segments using larger Dutch LMs. The ASR results show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline single-graph CS ASR systems, providing better performance on the monolingual Dutch segments without any accuracy loss on monolingual Frisian and code-mixed segments."

    "summary": "Despite advances in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR), code-switching (CS), the mixing of languages within an utterance common in daily speech, remains a severely underexplored challenge. In this paper, we introduce HiKE: the Hierarchical Korean-English code-switching benchmark, the first globally accessible evaluation framework for Korean-English CS, aiming to provide a means for the precise evaluation of multilingual ASR models and to foster research in the field. The proposed framework not only consists of high-quality, natural CS data across various topics, but also provides meticulous loanword labels and a hierarchical CS-level labeling scheme (word, phrase, and sentence) that together enable a systematic evaluation of a model's ability to handle each distinct level of code-switching. Through evaluations of diverse multilingual ASR models and fine-tuning experiments, this paper demonstrates that although most multilingual ASR models initially exhibit inadequate CS-ASR performance, this capability can be enabled through fine-tuning with synthetic CS data.

    "title": "AdaCS: Adaptive Normalization for Enhanced Code-Switching ASR",
    "summary": "Intra-sentential code-switching (CS) refers to the alternation between languages that happens within a single utterance and is a significant challenge for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. For example, when a Vietnamese speaker uses foreign proper names or specialized terms within their speech. ASR systems often struggle to accurately transcribe intra-sentential CS due to their training on monolingual data and the unpredictable nature of CS. This issue is even more pronounced for low-resource languages, where limited data availability hinders the development of robust models. In this study, we propose AdaCS, a normalization model integrates an adaptive bias attention module (BAM) into encoder-decoder network. This novel approach provides a robust solution to CS ASR in unseen domains, thereby significantly enhancing our contribution to the field. By utilizing BAM to both identify and normalize CS phrases, AdaCS enhances its adaptive capabilities with a biased list of words provided during inference. Our method demonstrates impressive performance and the ability to handle unseen CS phrases across various domains. Experiments show that AdaCS outperforms previous state-of-the-art method on Vietnamese CS ASR normalization by considerable WER reduction of 56.2% and 36.8% on the two proposed test sets."

    "summary": "Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual systems."

    "summary": "The field of Computer science (CS) has rapidly evolved over the past few decades, providing computational tools and methodologies to various fields and forming new interdisciplinary communities. This growth in CS has significantly impacted institutional practices and relevant research communities. Therefore, it is crucial to explore what specific research values, known as basic and fundamental beliefs that guide or motivate research attitudes or actions, CS-related research communities promote. Prior research has manually analyzed research values from a small sample of machine learning papers. No prior work has studied the automatic detection of research values in CS from large-scale scientific texts across different research subfields. This paper introduces a detailed annotation scheme featuring ten research values that guide CS-related research. Based on the scheme, we build value classifiers to scale up the analysis and present a systematic study over 226,600 paper abstracts from 32 CS-related subfields and 86 popular publishing venues over ten years."

    "title": "UniCUE: Unified Recognition and Generation Framework for Chinese Cued Speech Video-to-Speech Generation",
    "summary": "Cued Speech (CS) enhances lipreading via hand coding, offering visual phonemic cues that support precise speech perception for the hearing-impaired. The task of CS Video-to-Speech generation (CSV2S) aims to convert CS videos into intelligible speech signals. Most existing research focuses on CS Recognition (CSR), which transcribes video content into text. Consequently, a common solution for CSV2S is to integrate CSR with a text-to-speech (TTS) system. However, this pipeline relies on text as an intermediate medium, which may lead to error propagation and temporal misalignment between speech and CS video dynamics. In contrast, directly generating audio speech from CS video (direct CSV2S) often suffers from the inherent multimodal complexity and the limited availability of CS data. To address these challenges, we propose UniCUE, the first unified framework for CSV2S that directly generates speech from CS videos without relying on intermediate text. The core innovation of UniCUE lies in integrating an understanding task (CSR) that provides fine-grained CS visual-semantic cues to guide speech generation. Specifically, UniCUE incorporates a pose-aware visual processor, a semantic alignment pool that enables precise visual-semantic mapping, and a VisioPhonetic adapter to bridge the understanding and generation tasks within a unified architecture. To support this framework, we construct UniCUE-HI, a large-scale Mandarin CS dataset containing 11282 videos from 14 cuers, including both hearing-impaired and normal-hearing individuals. Extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate that UniCUE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics."

Therefore, five variants of the CS algorithm are used to compute a solution. Through tests, we conduct a study to choose the CS variant with parameters that give good results (execution time and quality of segmentation). CS variants are evaluated and compared with non-destructive testing (NDT) images using a misclassification error (ME) criterion."

    "title": "The long-wavelength thermal emission of the Pluto-Charon system from Herschel observations. Evidence for emissivity effects",
    "summary": "Thermal observations of the Pluto-Charon system acquired by the Herschel Space Observatory in February 2012 are presented. They consist of photometric measurements with the PACS and SPIRE instruments (nine visits to the Pluto system each), covering six wavelengths from 70 to 500 m altogether. The thermal light curve of Pluto-Charon is observed in all filters, albeit more marginally at 160 and especially 500 m. Putting these data into the context of older ISO, Spitzer and ground-based observations indicates that the brightness temperature (T ) of the system (rescaled to a common heliocentric distance) drastically decreases with increasing wavelength, from 53 K at 20 m to 35 K at 500 m, and perhaps ever less at longer wavelengths. Considering a variety of diurnal and/or seasonal thermophysical models, we show that T values of 35 K are lower than any expected temperature for the dayside surface or subsurface of Pluto and Charon, implying a low surface emissivity. Based on multiterrain modeling, we infer a spectral emissivity that decreases steadily from 1 at 20-25 m to 0.7 at 500~ m. This kind of behavior is usually not observed in asteroids (when proper allowance is made for subsurface sounding), but is found in several icy surfaces of the solar system. We tentatively identify that a combination of a strong dielectric constant and a considerable surface material transparency (typical penetration depth 1 cm) is responsible for the effect. Our results have implications for the interpretation of the temperature measurements by REX/New Horizons at 4.2 cm wavelength."

    "summary": "The automatic generation of counter-speech (CS) is a critical strategy for addressing hate speech by providing constructive and informed responses. However, existing methods often fail to generate high-quality, impactful, and scalable CS, particularly across diverse linguistic contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to enhance CS generation by aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages DPO to align LLM outputs with human preferences, ensuring contextually appropriate and linguistically adaptable responses. Additionally, we incorporate knowledge grounding to enhance the factual accuracy and relevance of generated CS. Experimental results demonstrate that DPO-aligned models significantly outperform SFT baselines on CS benchmarks while scaling effectively to multiple languages. These findings highlight the potential of preference-based alignment techniques to advance CS generation across varied linguistic settings. The model supervision and alignment is done in English and the same model is used for reporting metrics across other languages like Basque, Italian, and Spanish."

    "title": "Stirring in massive, young debris discs from spatially resolved Herschel images",
    "summary": "A significant fraction of main-sequence stars are encircled by dusty debris discs, where the short-lived dust particles are replenished through collisions between planetesimals. Most destructive collisions occur when the orbits of smaller bodies are dynamically stirred up, either by the gravitational effect of locally formed Pluto-sized planetesimals (self-stirring scenario), or via secular perturbation caused by an inner giant planet (planetary stirring). The relative importance of these scenarios in debris systems is unknown. Here we present new Herschel Space Observatory imagery of 11 discs selected from the most massive and extended known debris systems. All discs were found to be extended at far-infrared wavelengths, five of them being resolved for the first time. We evaluated the feasibility of the self-stirring scenario by comparing the measured disc sizes with the predictions of the model calculated for the ages of our targets. We concluded that the self-stirring explanation works for seven discs. However, in four cases, the predicted pace of outward propagation of the stirring front, assuming reasonable initial disc masses, was far too low to explain the radial extent of the cold dust. Therefore, for HD 9672, HD 16743, HD 21997, and HD 95086, another explanation is needed. We performed a similar analysis for ß Pic and HR 8799, reaching the same conclusion. We argue that planetary stirring is a promising possibility to explain the disk properties in these systems. In HR 8799 and HD 95086 we may already know the potential perturber, since their known outer giant planets could be responsible for the stirring process. Our study demonstrates that among the largest and most massive debris discs self-stirring may not be the only active scenario, and potentially planetary stirring is responsible for destructive collisions and debris dust production in a number of systems."

We propose a CS evaluation framework which includes multiple dimensions: search experience, knowledge gain, software usability, cognitive load and user experience, based on studies of conversational systems and IR. We introduce these evaluation criteria and propose their use in a framework for the evaluation of CS systems."

These signals were not visible on the seismograms, although seismic noises are continuously recorded by a side-by-side broadband seismometer. Moreover, seismological stations did not detect anything unusual, they presented a negative confirmation of the events. Our observation suggests that torsion balances might effectively detect precursory earthquake signals from a considerable distance. Such a finding could trigger the development of new observational devices and networks and can provide novel knowledge about the origin and mechanism of earthquake phenomena."

    "summary": "We propose using Carrier Sensing (CS) for distributed interference management in millimeter-wave (mmWave) cellular networks where spectrum is shared by multiple operators that do not coordinate among themselves. In addition, even the base station sites can be shared by the operators. We describe important challenges in using traditional CS in this setting and propose enhanced CS protocols to address these challenges. Using stochastic geometry, we develop a general framework for downlink coverage probability analysis of our shared mmWave network in the presence of CS and derive the downlink coverage probability expressions for several CS protocols. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to investigate and analyze (using stochastic geometry) CS for mmWave networks with spectrum and BS sites shared among non-coordinating operators. We evaluate the downlink coverage probability of our shared mmWave network using simulations as well as numerical examples based on our analysis. Our evaluations show that our proposed enhancements lead to an improvement in downlink coverage probability, compared to the downlink coverage probability with no CS, for higher values of signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR). Interestingly, our evaluations also reveal that for lower values of SINR, not using any CS is the best strategy in terms of the downlink coverage probability."

We describe a neural network simulator for the IBM GF11, an experimental SIMD machine with 566 processors and a peak arithmetic performance of 11 Gigaflops. We present our parallel implementation of the backpropagation learning algorithm, techniques for increasing efficiency, performance measurements on the NetTalk text-to-speech benchmark, and a performance model for the simulator. Our simulator currently runs the back-propagation learning algorithm at 900 million connections per second, where each \"connection per second\" includes both a forward and backward pass. This figure was obtained on the machine when only 356 processors were working; with all 566 processors operational, our simulation will run at over one billion connections per second. We conclude that the GF11 is well-suited to neural network simulation, and we analyze our use of the machine to determine which features are the most important for high performance."

    "title": "ALMA observations of the molecular gas in the debris disk of the 30 Myr old star HD 21997",
    "summary": "The 30 Myr old A3-type star HD 21997 is one of the two known debris dust disks having a measurable amount of cold molecular gas. With the goal of understanding the physical state, origin, and evolution of the gas in young debris disks, we obtained CO line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Here we report on the detection of 12CO and 13CO in the J=2-1 and J=3-2 transitions and C18O in the J=2-1 line. The gas exhibits a Keplerian velocity curve, one of the few direct measurements of Keplerian rotation in young debris disks. The measured CO brightness distribution could be reproduced by a simple star+disk system, whose parameters are r_in < 26 AU, r_out = 138 +/- 20 AU, M_*=1.8 +0.5 -0.2 M_Sun, and i = 32.6 +/- 3.1 degrees. The total CO mass, as calculated from the optically thin C18O line, is about (4-8) x 10^-2 M_Earth, while the CO line ratios suggest a radiation temperature on the order of 6-9 K. Comparing our results with those obtained for the dust component of the HD 21997 disk from the ALMA continuum observations by Moór et al., we conclude that comparable amounts of CO gas and dust are present in the disk. Interestingly, the gas and dust in the HD 21997 system are not co-located, indicating a dust-free inner gas disk within 55 AU of the star. We explore two possible scenarios for the origin of the gas. A secondary origin, which involves gas production from colliding or active planetesimals, would require unreasonably high gas production rates and would not explain why the gas and dust are not co-located. We propose that HD 21997 is a hybrid system where secondary debris dust and primordial gas coexist. HD 21997, whose age exceeds both the model predictions for disk clearing and the ages of the oldest T Tauri-like or transitional gas disks in the literature, may be a key object linking the primordial and the debris phases of disk evolution."

    "summary": "Context. Identifying minerals on asteroid surfaces is difficult as space weathering modifies the minerals infrared spectra. This shouldbe better understood for proper interpretation. Aims. We simulated the space weathering effects on a meteorite and recorded the alterations of the crystalline structure, such as the change in peak positions and full width at half maximum values. Methods. We used proton irradiation to simulate the effects of solar wind on a sample of NWA 10580 CO3 chondrite meteorites. After irradiation in three gradually increased steps with 1 keV ion energy, we used infrared microscopic reflectance and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to identify and understand the consequences of irradiation. Results. We find negative peak shifts after the first and second irradiations at pyroxene and feldspar minerals, similarly to the literature, and this shift was attributed to Mg loss. However, after the third irradiation a positive change in values in wavenumber emerged for silicates, which could come from the distortion of SiO4 tetrahedra, resembling shock deformation. The full width at half maximum values of major bands show a positive (increasing) trend after irradiations in the case of feldspars, using IR reflection measurements. Comparing DRIFTS and reflection infrared data, the peak positions of major mineral bands were at similar wavenumbers, but differences can be observed in minor bands. Conclusions. We measured the spectral changes of meteorite minerals after high doses of proton irradiation for several minerals. We show the first of these measurements for feldspars; previous works only presented pyroxene, olivine, and phyllosilicates."

    "title": "Computational Approaches to Arabic-English Code-Switching",
    "summary": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a vital computational method for addressing language processing, analysis, and generation. NLP tasks form the core of many daily applications, from automatic text correction to speech recognition. While significant research has focused on NLP tasks for the English language, less attention has been given to Modern Standard Arabic and Dialectal Arabic. Globalization has also contributed to the rise of Code-Switching (CS), where speakers mix languages within conversations and even within individual words (intra-word CS). This is especially common in Arab countries, where people often switch between dialects or between dialects and a foreign language they master. CS between Arabic and English is frequent in Egypt, especially on social media. Consequently, a significant amount of code-switched content can be found online. Such code-switched data needs to be investigated and analyzed for several NLP tasks to tackle the challenges of this multilingual phenomenon and Arabic language challenges. No work has been done before for several integral NLP tasks on Arabic-English CS data. In this work, we focus on the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task and other tasks that help propose a solution for the NER task on CS data, e.g., Language Identification. This work addresses this gap by proposing and applying state-of-the-art techniques for Modern Standard Arabic and Arabic-English NER. We have created the first annotated CS Arabic-English corpus for the NER task. Also, we apply two enhancement techniques to improve the NER tagger on CS data using CS contextual embeddings and data augmentation techniques. All methods showed improvements in the performance of the NER taggers on CS data. Finally, we propose several intra-word language identification approaches to determine the language type of a mixed text and identify whether it is a named entity or not."

    "summary": "Although photometric and spectroscopic surveys with the Spitzer Space Telescope increased remarkably the number of well studied debris disks around A-type and Sun-like stars, detailed analyzes of debris disks around F-type stars remained less frequent. Using the MIPS camera and the IRS spectrograph we searched for debris dust around 82 F-type stars with Spitzer. We found 27 stars that harbor debris disks, nine of which are new discoveries. The dust distribution around two of our stars, HD 50571 and HD 170773, was found to be marginally extended on the 70um MIPS images. Combining the MIPS and IRS measurements with additional infrared and submillimeter data, we achieved excellent spectral coverage for most of our debris systems. We have modeled the excess emission of 22 debris disks using a single temperature dust ring model and of 5 debris systems with two-temperature models. The latter systems may contain two dust rings around the star. In accordance with the expected trends, the fractional luminosity of the disks declines with time, exhibiting a decay rate consistent with the range of model predictions. We found the distribution of radial dust distances as a function of age to be consistent with the predictions of both the self stirred and the planetary stirred disk evolution models. A more comprehensive investigation of the evolution of debris disks around F-type stars, partly based on the presented data set, will be the subject of an upcoming paper."

    "title": "Applying Sorting Networks to Synthesize Optimized Sorting Libraries",
    "summary": "This paper shows an application of the theory of sorting networks to facilitate the synthesis of optimized general purpose sorting libraries. Standard sorting libraries are often based on combinations of the classic Quicksort algorithm with insertion sort applied as the base case for small fixed numbers of inputs. Unrolling the code for the base case by ignoring loop conditions eliminates branching and results in code which is equivalent to a sorting network. This enables the application of further program transformations based on sorting network optimizations, and eventually the synthesis of code from sorting networks. We show that if considering the number of comparisons and swaps then theory predicts no real advantage of this approach. However, significant speed-ups are obtained when taking advantage of instruction level parallelism and non-branching conditional assignment instructions, both of which are common in modern CPU architectures. We provide empirical evidence that using code synthesized from efficient sorting networks as the base case for Quicksort libraries results in significant real-world speed-ups."

Thermal emission measurements obtained with the Herschel/PACS and Spitzer/MIPS instruments of Sycorax and Caliban were also analysed and used to determine size, albedo and surface characteristics of these bodies. We compare these properties with the rotational and surface characteristics of irregular satellites in other giant planet systems and also with those of main belt and Trojan asteroids and trans-Neptunian objects. Our results indicate that the Uranian irregular satellite system likely went through a more intense collisional evolution than the irregular satellites of Jupiter and Saturn. Surface characteristics of Uranian irregular satellites seems to resemble the Centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects more than irregular satellites around other giant planets, suggesting the existence of a compositional discontinuity in the young Solar system inside the orbit of Uranus."

    "title": "Multi-Armed Bandit Based Client Scheduling for Federated Learning",
    "summary": "By exploiting the computing power and local data of distributed clients, federated learning (FL) features ubiquitous properties such as reduction of communication overhead and preserving data privacy. In each communication round of FL, the clients update local models based on their own data and upload their local updates via wireless channels. However, latency caused by hundreds to thousands of communication rounds remains a bottleneck in FL. To minimize the training latency, this work provides a multi-armed bandit-based framework for online client scheduling (CS) in FL without knowing wireless channel state information and statistical characteristics of clients. Firstly, we propose a CS algorithm based on the upper confidence bound policy (CS-UCB) for ideal scenarios where local datasets of clients are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and balanced. An upper bound of the expected performance regret of the proposed CS-UCB algorithm is provided, which indicates that the regret grows logarithmically over communication rounds. Then, to address non-ideal scenarios with non-i.i.d. and unbalanced properties of local datasets and varying availability of clients, we further propose a CS algorithm based on the UCB policy and virtual queue technique (CS-UCB-Q). An upper bound is also derived, which shows that the expected performance regret of the proposed CS-UCB-Q algorithm can have a sub-linear growth over communication rounds under certain conditions. Besides, the convergence performance of FL training is also analyzed. Finally, simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms."

The Haumea occultation size estimate (equivalent diameter 1595 km) is larger than previous radiometric solutions (in the range between 1150 and 1350 km), which lowers the object's density to about 1.8 gcm-3, a value closer to the densities of other large TNOs.

We compare 100 and 160um thermal lightcurve amplitudes - originating from Haumea itself - with models of the total measured system fluxes (ring, satellite, Haumea) from 24-350um. The combination with results derived from the occultation measurements show that Haumea's crystalline water ice surface must have a thermal inertia of ~5 SIu. We also have indications that the satellites (at least Hi'iaka) must have high geometric albedos >=0.5, otherwise the derived thermal amplitude would be inconsistent with the total measured system fluxes at 24, 70, 100, 160, 250, and 350um. The high albedos imply sizes of about 300 and 150 km for Hi'iaka and Namaka, respectively, indicating unexpectedly high densities >1.0 gcm-3 for TNOs this small, and the assumed collisional formation from Haumea's icy crust. We also estimated the thermal emission of the ring for the time period 1980-2030, showing that the contribution during the Spitzer and Herschel epochs was small, but not negligible. Due to the progressive opening of the ring plane, the ring emission will be increasing in the next decade when JWST is operational. In the MIRI 25.5um band it will also be possible to obtain a very high-quality thermal lightcurve to test the derived Haumea properties."

    "title": "ALMA continuum observations of a 30 Myr old gaseous debris disk around HD 21997",
    "summary": "Circumstellar disks around stars older than 10 Myr are expected to be gas-poor. There are, however, two examples of old (30-40 Myr) debris-like disks containing a detectable amount of cold CO gas. Here we present ALMA and Herschel Space Observatory observations of one of these disks, around HD 21997, and study the distribution and origin of the dust and its connection to the gas. Our ALMA continuum images at 886um clearly resolve a broad ring of emission within a diameter of ~4.5 arcsec, adding HD 21997 to the dozen debris disks resolved at (sub)millimeter wavelengths. Modeling the morphology of the ALMA image with a radiative transfer code suggests inner and outer radii of ~55 and ~150 AU, and a dust mass of 0.09 M_Earth. Our data and modeling hints at an extended cold outskirt of the ring. Comparison with the morphology of the CO gas in the disk reveals an inner dust-free hole where gas nevertheless can be detected. Based on dust grain lifetimes, we propose that the dust content of this gaseous disk is of secondary origin produced by planetesimals. Since the gas component is probably primordial, HD 21997 is one of the first known examples of a hybrid circumstellar disk, a so-far little studied late phase of circumstellar disk evolution."

    "title": "Compressively Sensed Image Recognition",
    "summary": "Compressive Sensing (CS) theory asserts that sparse signal reconstruction is possible from a small number of linear measurements. Although CS enables low-cost linear sampling, it requires non-linear and costly reconstruction. Recent literature works show that compressive image classification is possible in CS domain without reconstruction of the signal. In this work, we introduce a DCT base method that extracts binary discriminative features directly from CS measurements. These CS measurements can be obtained by using (i) a random or a pseudo-random measurement matrix, or (ii) a measurement matrix whose elements are learned from the training data to optimize the given classification task. We further introduce feature fusion by concatenating Bag of Words (BoW) representation of our binary features with one of the two state-of-the-art CNN-based feature vectors. We show that our fused feature outperforms the state-of-the-art in both cases."

    "summary": "Recently, a new planet candidate was discovered on direct images around the young (10-17 Myr) A-type star HD95086. The strong infrared excess of the system indicates that, similarly to HR8799, ß Pic, and Fomalhaut, the star harbors a circumstellar disk. Aiming to study the structure and gas content of the HD95086 disk, and to investigate its possible interaction with the newly discovered planet, here we present new optical, infrared and millimeter observations. We detected no CO emission, excluding the possibility of an evolved gaseous primordial disk. Simple blackbody modeling of the spectral energy distribution suggests the presence of two spatially separate dust belts at radial distances of 6 and 64 AU. Our resolved images obtained with the Herschel Space Observatory reveal a characteristic disk size of ~6.0x5.4 arcsec (540x490 AU) and disk inclination of ~25 degree. Assuming the same inclination for the planet candidate's orbit, its re-projected radial distance from the star is 62 AU, very close to the blackbody radius of the outer cold dust ring. The structure of the planetary system at HD95086 resembles the one around HR8799. Both systems harbor a warm inner dust belt and a broad colder outer disk and giant planet(s) between the two dusty regions. Modelling implies that the candidate planet can dynamically excite the motion of planetesimals even out to 270 AU via their secular perturbation if its orbital eccentricity is larger than about 0.4. Our analysis adds a new example to the three known systems where directly imaged planet(s) and debris disks co-exist."

    "summary": "With the aim of developing a fast yet accurate algorithm for compressive sensing (CS) reconstruction of natural images, we combine in this paper the merits of two existing categories of CS methods: the structure insights of traditional optimization-based methods and the speed of recent network-based ones. Specifically, we propose a novel structured deep network, dubbed ISTA-Net, which is inspired by the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) for optimizing a general norm CS reconstruction model. To cast ISTA into deep network form, we develop an effective strategy to solve the proximal mapping associated with the sparsity-inducing regularizer using nonlinear transforms. All the parameters in ISTA-Net ( nonlinear transforms, shrinkage thresholds, step sizes, etc.) are learned end-to-end, rather than being hand-crafted. Moreover, considering that the residuals of natural images are more compressible, an enhanced version of ISTA-Net in the residual domain, dubbed ISTA-Net , is derived to further improve CS reconstruction. Extensive CS experiments demonstrate that the proposed ISTA-Nets outperform existing state-of-the-art optimization-based and network-based CS methods by large margins, while maintaining fast computational speed.

While today's neural end-to-end (E2E) models deliver state-of-the-art performances on the task of automatic speech recognition (ASR) it is commonly known that these systems are very data-intensive. However, there is only a few transcribed and aligned CS speech available. To overcome this problem and train multilingual systems which can transcribe CS speech, we propose a simple yet effective data augmentation in which audio and corresponding labels of different source languages are concatenated. By using this training data, our E2E model improves on transcribing CS speech. It also surpasses monolingual models on monolingual tests. The results show that this augmentation technique can even improve the model's performance on inter-sentential language switches not seen during training by 5,03% WER."

Given that significant progress has been made on NER, we believe that scholarly domain-specific NER will receive increasing attention in the years to come. Currently, progress on CS NER -- the focus of this work -- is hampered in part by its recency and the lack of a standardized annotation aim for scientific entities/terms. This work proposes a standardized task by defining a set of seven contribution-centric scholarly entities for CS NER viz., research problem, solution, resource, language, tool, method, and dataset. Following which, its main contributions are: combines existing CS NER resources that maintain their annotation focus on the set or subset of contribution-centric scholarly entities we consider; further, noting the need for big data to train neural NER models, this work additionally supplies thousands of contribution-centric entity annotations from article titles and abstracts, thus releasing a cumulative large novel resource for CS NER; and, finally, trains a sequence labeling CS NER model inspired after state-of-the-art neural architectures from the general domain NER task. Throughout the work, several practical considerations are made which can be useful to information technology designers of the digital libraries."

    "summary": "Many social networks and complex systems are found to be naturally divided into clusters of densely connected nodes, known as community structure (CS). Finding CS is one of fundamental yet challenging topics in network science. One of the most popular classes of methods for this problem is to maximize Newman's modularity. However, there is a little understood on how well we can approximate the maximum modularity as well as the implications of finding community structure with provable guarantees. In this paper, we settle definitely the approximability of modularity clustering, proving that approximating the problem within any (multiplicative) positive factor is intractable, unless P = NP. Yet we propose the first additive approximation algorithm for modularity clustering with a constant factor. Moreover, we provide a rigorous proof that a CS with modularity arbitrary close to maximum modularity QOPT might bear no similarity to the optimal CS of maximum modularity. Thus even when CS with near-optimal modularity are found, other verification methods are needed to confirm the significance of the structure."

A sub-task of TS is Cognitive Simplification (CS), converting text to a form that is readily understood by people with cognitive disabilities without rendering it childish or simplistic. This sub-task has yet to be explored with neural methods in NLP, and resources for it are scarcely available. In this paper, we present a method for incorporating knowledge from the cognitive accessibility domain into a TS model, by introducing an inductive bias regarding what simplification operations to use. We show that by adding this inductive bias to a TS-trained model, it is able to adapt better to CS without ever seeing CS data, and outperform a baseline model on a traditional TS benchmark. In addition, we provide a novel test dataset for CS, and analyze the differences between CS corpora and existing TS corpora, in terms of how simplification operations are applied."

In this paper we summarize our PACS data reduction scheme that uses a modified version of the standard pipeline for basic data reduction, optimized for faint, moving targets. Due to the low flux density of our targets the observations are confusion noise limited or at least often affected by bright nearby background sources at 100 and 160\\, m. To overcome these problems we developed techniques to characterize and eliminate the background at the positions of our targets and a background matching technique to compensate for pointing errors. We derive a variety of maps as science data products that are used depending on the source flux and background levels and the scientific purpose. Our techniques are also applicable to a wealth of other Herschel solar system photometric observations, e.g. comets and near-Earth asteroids. The principles of our observing strategies and reduction techniques for moving targets will also be applicable for similar surveys of future infrared space projects."

    "summary": "The rotational states of the members in the dwarf planet - satellite systems in the transneptunian region are determined by the formation conditions and the tidal interaction between the components, and these rotational characteristics are the prime tracers of their evolution. Previously a number of authors claimed highly diverse values for the rotation period for the dwarf planet Eris, ranging from a few hours to a rotation (nearly) synchronous with the orbital period (15.8 d) of its satellite, Dysnomia. In this letter we present new light curve data of Eris, taken with 1-2m-class ground based telescopes, and with the TESS and Gaia space telescopes. TESS data could not provide a well-defined light curve period, but could constrain light curve variations to a maximum possible light curve amplitude of 0.03 mag (1- ) for P 24 h periods. Both the combined ground-based data and the Gaia measurements unambiguously point to a light curve period equal to the orbital period of Dysnomia, P = 15.8 d, with a light curve amplitude of 0.03 mag, i.e. the rotation of Eris is tidally locked. Assuming that Dysnomia has a collisional origin, calculations with a simple tidal evolution model show that Dysnomia has to be relatively massive (mass ratio of q = 0.01--0.03) and large (radius of 300 km) to slow down Eris to synchronized rotation. These simulations also indicate that -- assuming tidal parameters usually considered for transneptunian objects -- the density of Dysnomia should be 1.8-2.4 , an exceptionally high value among similarly sized transneptunian objects, putting important constraints on the formation conditions."

    "title": "Deep Learning-Based Decoding of Constrained Sequence Codes",

Sequences encoded with constrained sequence codes satisfy constraints imposed by the physical channel to enable efficient and reliable transmission of coded symbols. In this paper, we propose using deep learning approaches to decode fixed-length and variable-length CS codes. Traditional encoding and decoding of fixed-length CS codes rely on look-up tables (LUTs), which is prone to errors that occur during transmission. We introduce fixed-length constrained sequence decoding based on multiple layer perception (MLP) networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and demonstrate that we are able to achieve low bit error rates that are close to maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) decoding as well as improve the system throughput. Further, implementation of capacity-achieving fixed-length codes, where the complexity is prohibitively high with LUT decoding, becomes practical with deep learning-based decoding. We then consider CNN-aided decoding of variable-length CS codes. Different from conventional decoding where the received sequence is processed bit-by-bit, we propose using CNNs to perform one-shot batch-processing of variable-length CS codes such that an entire batch is decoded at once, which improves the system throughput. Moreover, since the CNNs can exploit global information with batch-processing instead of only making use of local information as in conventional bit-by-bit processing, the error rates can be reduced. We present simulation results that show excellent performance with both fixed-length and variable-length CS codes that are used in the frontiers of wireless communication systems."

Existing methods often fail to capture the subtle phonological shifts inherent in CS scenarios. The challenge is particularly difficult for language pairs like Vietnamese and English, where both distinct phonological features and the ambiguity arising from similar sound recognition are present. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for Vietnamese-English CS ASR, a Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric model (TSPC). The TSPC employs a phoneme-centric approach, built upon an extended Vietnamese phoneme set as an intermediate representation to facilitate mixed-lingual modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that TSPC consistently outperforms existing baselines, including PhoWhisper-base, in Vietnamese-English CS ASR, achieving a significantly lower word error rate of 19.9% with reduced training resources. Furthermore, the phonetic-based two-stage architecture enables phoneme adaptation and language conversion to enhance ASR performance in complex CS Vietnamese-English ASR scenarios"

    "summary": "Debris disks are considered to be gas-poor, but recent observations revealed molecular or atomic gas in several 10-40 Myr old systems. We used the APEX and IRAM 30m radiotelescopes to search for CO gas in 20 bright debris disks. In one case, around the 16 Myr old A-type star HD 131835, we discovered a new gas-bearing debris disk, where the CO 3-2 transition was successfully detected. No other individual system exhibited a measurable CO signal. Our Herschel Space Observatory far-infrared images of HD 131835 marginally resolved the disk both at 70 and 100 m, with a characteristic radius of ~170 au. While in stellar properties HD 131835 resembles Pic, its dust disk properties are similar to those of the most massive young debris disks. With the detection of gas in HD 131835 the number of known debris disks with CO content has increased to four, all of them encircling young ( 40 Myr) A-type stars. Based on statistics within 125 pc, we suggest that the presence of detectable amount of gas in the most massive debris disks around young A-type stars is a common phenomenon. Our current data cannot conclude on the origin of gas in HD 131835. If the gas is secondary, arising from the disruption of planetesimals, then HD 131835 is a comparably young and in terms of its disk more massive analogue of the Pic system. However, it is also possible that this system similarly to HD 21997 possesses a hybrid disk, where the gas material is predominantly primordial, while the dust grains are mostly derived from planetesimals."

To address data scarcity, a modified audio-splicing approach is introduced to generate artificial CS speech data. Fine-tuning an already fine-tuned SSL model with the proposed Spliced-Audio Generated (SAGE) data results in an absolute improvement on Word Error Rate (WER) of 7.8% on Arabic and English CS benchmarks. Additionally, an Experience Replay (ER) inspired approach is proposed to enhance generalisation across DA and CS speech while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Integrating an out-of-domain 3-gram language model reduces the overall mean WER from 31.7% to 26.6%. Few-shot fine-tuning for code-switching benchmarks further improves WER by 4.9%.

For GD 154, we detected two new eigenmodes, and the recurrence of the pulsational behaviour first observed in 1977. We discuss that GD 154 does not only vary its pulsations between a multiperiodic and a quasi-monoperiodic phase, but there are also differences between the relative amplitudes of the near-subharmonics observed in the latter phase. In the complex pulsator, Ross 808, we compared the pre- and post Whole Earth Telescope campaign measurements, and determined two new frequencies besides the ones observed during the campaign. Studying these stars can contribute to better understanding of pulsations close to the empirical ZZ Ceti red edge. All three targets are in that regime of the ZZ Ceti instability strip where short-term amplitude variations or even outbursts are likely to occur, which are not well-understood theoretically."

    "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving distributed deep learning paradigm that involves substantial communication and computation effort, which is a problem for resource-constrained mobile and IoT devices. Model pruning/sparsification develops sparse models that could solve this problem, but existing sparsification solutions cannot satisfy at the same time the requirements for low bidirectional communication overhead between the server and the clients, low computation overhead at the clients, and good model accuracy, under the FL assumption that the server does not have access to raw data to fine-tune the pruned models. We propose Complement Sparsification (CS), a pruning mechanism that satisfies all these requirements through a complementary and collaborative pruning done at the server and the clients. At each round, CS creates a global sparse model that contains the weights that capture the general data distribution of all clients, while the clients create local sparse models with the weights pruned from the global model to capture the local trends. For improved model performance, these two types of complementary sparse models are aggregated into a dense model in each round, which is subsequently pruned in an iterative process. CS requires little computation overhead on the top of vanilla FL for both the server and the clients. We demonstrate that CS is an approximation of vanilla FL and, thus, its models perform well. We evaluate CS experimentally with two popular FL benchmark datasets. CS achieves substantial reduction in bidirectional communication, while achieving performance comparable with vanilla FL. In addition, CS outperforms baseline pruning mechanisms for FL."

One frequent research question has been how different conference and journal publications are, considering a paper as a unit of analysis. This study takes an author-based approach to analyze publishing patterns of 517,763 scholars who have ever published both in CS conferences and journals for the last 57 years, as recorded in DBLP. The analysis shows that the majority of CS scholars tend to make their scholarly debut, publish more papers, and collaborate with more coauthors in conferences than in journals. Importantly, conference papers seem to serve as a distinct channel of scholarly communication, not a mere preceding step to journal publications: coauthors and title words of authors across conferences and journals tend not to overlap much. This study corroborates findings of previous studies on this topic from a distinctive perspective and suggests that conference authorship in CS calls for more special attention from scholars and administrators outside CS who have focused on journal publications to mine authorship data and evaluate scholarly performance."

    "summary": "In this work, we seek to build effective code-switched (CS) automatic speech recognition systems (ASR) under the zero-shot setting where no transcribed CS speech data is available for training. Previously proposed frameworks which conditionally factorize the bilingual task into its constituent monolingual parts are a promising starting point for leveraging monolingual data efficiently. However, these methods require the monolingual modules to perform language segmentation. That is, each monolingual module has to simultaneously detect CS points and transcribe speech segments of one language while ignoring those of other languages -- not a trivial task. We propose to simplify each monolingual module by allowing them to transcribe all speech segments indiscriminately with a monolingual script (i.e. transliteration). This simple modification passes the responsibility of CS point detection to subsequent bilingual modules which determine the final output by considering multiple monolingual transliterations along with external language model information. We apply this transliteration-based approach in an end-to-end differentiable neural network and demonstrate its efficacy for zero-shot CS ASR on Mandarin-English SEAME test sets."

This paper introduces an introductory CS course where students learn computational thinking through computer vision, a sub-field of AI, as an application context. The course aims to achieve computational thinking outcomes alongside critical thinking outcomes that expose students to AI approaches and their societal implications. Through experiential activities such as individual projects and reading discussions, our course seeks to balance technical learning and critical thinking goals. Our evaluation, based on pre-and post-course surveys, shows an improved sense of belonging, self-efficacy, and AI ethics awareness among students. The results suggest that an AI-focused context can enhance participation and employability, student-selected projects support self-efficacy, and ethically grounded AI instruction can be effective for interdisciplinary audiences. Students' discussions on reading assignments demonstrated deep engagement with the complex challenges in today's AI landscape.

The former achieves higher average precision, but suffers from variance, while the latter achieves linear complexity to data size and has lower variance. The current work focuses instead on combining these two methods, along with rotated feature bagging, to achieve linear time complexity both to data size and to number of features.

These properties have been derived from optical and thermal infrared measurements. Our optical measurements revealed a likely full period of ~9.4 h with a shallow amplitude of 4.5%. By combining optical brightness information and thermal emission data, we are able to derive a diameter of 62.3 +/- 5.3 km and a geometric albedo of 2.9% -- corresponding to an extremely dark surface. Additionally, our finding of ~> 50 Jm^ -2 K^ -1 s^ -1/2 for the thermal inertia is also noticeably for objects in such a distance. The results of dynamical simulations yield an unstable orbit, with a 50% probability that the target will be ejected from the Solar System within 700,000 years. The current orbit of this object as well as its instability could imply a pristine cometary surface. This possibility is in agreement with the observed low geometric albedo and red photometric colour indices for the object, which are a good match for the surface of a dormant comet -- as would be expected for a long-period cometary body approaching perihelion. Despite the fact it was approaching ever closer to the Sun, however, the object exhibited star-like profiles in each of our observations, lacking any sign of cometary activity. By the albedo, 2013 AZ60 is a candidate for the darkest body among the known TNOs."

    "summary": "Unlike NASA's original Kepler Discovery Mission, the renewed K2 Mission will stare at the plane of the Ecliptic, observing each field for approximately 75 days. This will bring new opportunities and challenges, in particular the presence of a large number of main-belt asteroids that will contaminate the photometry. The large pixel size makes K2 data susceptible to the effect of apparent minor planet encounters. Here we investigate the effects of asteroid encounters on photometric precision using a sub-sample of the K2 Engineering data taken in February, 2014. We show examples of asteroid contamination to facilitate their recognition and distinguish these events from other error sources. We conclude that main-belt asteroids will have considerable effects on K2 photometry of a large number of photometric targets during the Mission, that will have to be taken into account. These results will be readily applicable for future space photometric missions applying large-format CCDs, such as TESS and PLATO."

    "title": "Fundamental Limits of CDF-Based Scheduling: Throughput, Fairness, and Feedback Overhead",
    "summary": "In this paper, we investigate fundamental performance limits of cumulative distribution function (CDF)-based scheduling (CS) in downlink cellular networks. CS is known as an efficient scheduling method that can assign different time fractions for users or, equivalently, satisfy different channel access ratio (CAR) requirements of users while exploiting multi-user diversity. We first mathematically analyze the throughput characteristics of CS in arbitrary fading statistics and data rate functions. It is shown that the throughput gain of CS increases as the CAR of a user decreases or the number of users in a cell increases. For Nakagami-m fading channels, we obtain the average throughput in closed-form and investigate the effects of the average signal-to-noise ratio, the shape parameter m, and the CAR on the throughput performance. In addition, we propose a threshold-based opportunistic feedback technique in order to reduce feedback overhead while satisfying the CAR requirements of users. We prove that the average feedback overhead of the proposed technique is upper bounded by -ln(p), where p is the probability that no user satisfies the threshold condition in a cell. Finally, we adopt a novel fairness criterion, called qualitative fairness, which considers not only the quantity of the allocated resources to users but also the quality of the resources. It is observed that CS provides a better qualitative fairness than other scheduling algorithms designed for controlling CARs of users."

    "summary": "The sparse matrix-vector product (SpMV) is a fundamental operation in many scientific applications from various fields. The High Performance Computing (HPC) community has therefore continuously invested a lot of effort to provide an efficient SpMV kernel on modern CPU architectures. Although it has been shown that block-based kernels help to achieve high performance, they are difficult to use in practice because of the zero padding they require. In the current paper, we propose new kernels using the AVX-512 instruction set, which makes it possible to use a blocking scheme without any zero padding in the matrix memory storage. We describe mask-based sparse matrix formats and their corresponding SpMV kernels highly optimized in assembly language. Considering that the optimal blocking size depends on the matrix, we also provide a method to predict the best kernel to be used utilizing a simple interpolation of results from previous executions. We compare the performance of our approach to that of the Intel MKL CSR kernel and the CSR5 open-source package on a set of standard benchmark matrices. We show that we can achieve significant improvements in many cases, both for sequential and for parallel executions. Finally, we provide the corresponding code in an open source library, called SPC5."

    "summary": "Being able to parse code-switched (CS) utterances, such as Spanish+English or Hindi+English, is essential to democratize task-oriented semantic parsing systems for certain locales. In this work, we focus on Spanglish (Spanish+English) and release a dataset, CSTOP, containing 5800 CS utterances alongside their semantic parses. We examine the CS generalizability of various Cross-lingual (XL) models and exhibit the advantage of pre-trained XL language models when data for only one language is present. As such, we focus on improving the pre-trained models for the case when only English corpus alongside either zero or a few CS training instances are available. We propose two data augmentation methods for the zero-shot and the few-shot settings: fine-tune using translate-and-align and augment using a generation model followed by match-and-filter. Combining the few-shot setting with the above improvements decreases the initial 30-point accuracy gap between the zero-shot and the full-data settings by two thirds."

This paper presents our investigations on end-to-end speech recognition for Mandarin-English CS speech. We analyse different CS specific issues such as the properties mismatches between languages in a CS language pair, the unpredictable nature of switching points, and the data scarcity problem. We exploit and improve the state-of-the-art end-to-end system by merging nonlinguistic symbols, by integrating language identification using hierarchical softmax, by modeling sub-word units, by artificially lowering the speaking rate, and by augmenting data using speed perturbed technique and several monolingual datasets to improve the final performance not only on CS speech but also on monolingual benchmarks in order to make the system more applicable on real life settings. Finally, we explore the effect of different language model integration methods on the performance of the proposed model. Our experimental results reveal that all the proposed techniques improve the recognition performance. The best combined system improves the baseline system by up to 35% relatively in terms of mixed error rate and delivers acceptable performance on monolingual benchmarks."

    "summary": "This research aims to explore various methods for assessing user feedback in mixed-initiative conversational search (CS) systems. While CS systems enjoy profuse advancements across multiple aspects, recent research fails to successfully incorporate feedback from the users. One of the main reasons for that is the lack of system-user conversational interaction data. To this end, we propose a user simulator-based framework for multi-turn interactions with a variety of mixed-initiative CS systems. Specifically, we develop a user simulator, dubbed ConvSim, that, once initialized with an information need description, is capable of providing feedback to a system's responses, as well as answering potential clarifying questions. Our experiments on a wide variety of state-of-the-art passage retrieval and neural re-ranking models show that effective utilization of user feedback can lead to 16% retrieval performance increase in terms of nDCG@3. Moreover, we observe consistent improvements as the number of feedback rounds increases (35% relative improvement in terms of nDCG@3 after three rounds). This points to a research gap in the development of specific feedback processing modules and opens a potential for significant advancements in CS. To support further research in the topic, we release over 30,000 transcripts of system-simulator interactions based on well-established CS datasets."

    "summary": "Query performance prediction (QPP) is a core task in information retrieval. The QPP task is to predict the retrieval quality of a search system for a query without relevance judgments. Research has shown the effectiveness and usefulness of QPP for ad-hoc search. Recent years have witnessed considerable progress in conversational search (CS). Effective QPP could help a CS system to decide an appropriate action to be taken at the next turn. Despite its potential, QPP for CS has been little studied. We address this research gap by reproducing and studying the effectiveness of existing QPP methods in the context of CS. While the task of passage retrieval remains the same in the two settings, a user query in CS depends on the conversational history, introducing novel QPP challenges. In particular, we seek to explore to what extent findings from QPP methods for ad-hoc search generalize to three CS settings: (i) estimating the retrieval quality of different query rewriting-based retrieval methods, (ii) estimating the retrieval quality of a conversational dense retrieval method, and (iii) estimating the retrieval quality for top ranks vs. deeper-ranked lists. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) supervised QPP methods distinctly outperform unsupervised counterparts only when a large-scale training set is available; (ii) point-wise supervised QPP methods outperform their list-wise counterparts in most cases; and (iii) retrieval score-based unsupervised QPP methods show high effectiveness in assessing the conversational dense retrieval method, ConvDR."

    "summary": "Modern online platforms offer users an opportunity to participate in a variety of content-creation, social networking, and shopping activities. With the rapid proliferation of such online services, learning data-driven user behavior models is indispensable to enable personalized user experiences. Recently, representation learning has emerged as an effective strategy for user modeling, powered by neural networks trained over large volumes of interaction data. Despite their enormous potential, we encounter the unique challenge of data sparsity for a vast majority of entities, e.g., sparsity in ground-truth labels for entities and in entity-level interactions (cold-start users, items in the long-tail, and ephemeral groups). In this dissertation, we develop generalizable neural representation learning frameworks for user behavior modeling designed to address different sparsity challenges across applications. Our problem settings span transductive and inductive learning scenarios, where transductive learning models entities seen during training and inductive learning targets entities that are only observed during inference. We leverage different facets of information reflecting user behavior (e.g., interconnectivity in social networks, temporal and attributed interaction information) to enable personalized inference at scale. Our proposed models are complementary to concurrent advances in neural architectural choices and are adaptive to the rapid addition of new applications in online platforms."

    "title": "First-Order Context-Specific Likelihood Weighting in Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs",
    "summary": "Statistical relational AI and probabilistic logic programming have so far mostly focused on discrete probabilistic models. The reasons for this is that one needs to provide constructs to succinctly model the independencies in such models, and also provide efficient inference. Three types of independencies are important to represent and exploit for scalable inference in hybrid models: conditional independencies elegantly modeled in Bayesian networks, context-specific independencies naturally represented by logical rules, and independencies amongst attributes of related objects in relational models succinctly expressed by combining rules. This paper introduces a hybrid probabilistic logic programming language, DC#, which integrates distributional clauses' syntax and semantics principles of Bayesian logic programs. It represents the three types of independencies qualitatively. More importantly, we also introduce the scalable inference algorithm FO-CS-LW for DC#. FO-CS-LW is a first-order extension of the context-specific likelihood weighting algorithm (CS-LW), a novel sampling method that exploits conditional independencies and context-specific independencies in ground models. The FO-CS-LW algorithm upgrades CS-LW with unification and combining rules to the first-order case."

    "title": "The molecular gas content throughout the low-z merger sequence",
    "summary": "Exploiting IRAM 30m CO spectroscopy, we find that SDSS post-merger galaxies display gas fractions and depletion times enhanced by 25-50%, a mildly higher CO excitation, and standard molecular-to-atomic gas ratios, compared to non-interacting galaxies with similar redshift, stellar mass ( ) and star-formation rate (SFR). To place these results in context, we compile further samples of interacting or starbursting galaxies, from pre-coalescence kinematic pairs to post-starbursts, carefully homogenising gas mass, and SFR measurements in the process. We explore systematics by duplicating our analysis for different SFR and estimators, finding good qualitative agreement in general. Gas fractions and depletion times are enhanced in interacting pairs, albeit by less than for post-mergers. Among all samples studied, gas fraction and depletion time enhancements appear largest in young (a few 100 Myr) post-starbursts. While there is only partial overlap between post-mergers and post-starbursts, this suggests that molecular gas reservoirs are boosted throughout most stages of galaxy interactions, plausibly due to torque-driven inflows of halo gas and gas compression. The gas fraction and depletion time offsets of mergers and post-starbursts anti-correlate with distance from the galaxy main sequence , evidencing the role of SFE in driving the high SFRs of the strongest starbursts. Post-starbursts display the steepest dependency of gas fraction and SFE-offsets on , with an evolving normalisation that reflects gas reservoir depletion over time. Our multi-sample analysis paints a coherent picture of the starburst-merger connection throughout the low-z merger sequence. It reconciles contradictory literature findings by highlighting that gas fraction enhancements and SFE variations both play their part in merger-driven star formation."

For one star (GW UMa), our observations are the first since the discovery of its pulsational nature from the Hipparcos data.The primary goal of this project was to update our knowledge on the period variations of the target stars. For this, we have collected all available photometric observations from the literature and constructed decades-long O-C diagrams of the stars. This traditional method is useful because of the single-periodic nature of the light variations. Text-book examples of slow period evolution (XX Cyg, DY Her, DY Peg) and cyclic period changes due to light-time effect (LITE) in a binary system (SZ Lyn) are updated with the new observations. For YZ Boo, we find a period decrease instead of increase. The previously suggested LITE-solution of BE Lyn (Kiss & Szatmary 1995) is not supported with the new O-C diagram. Instead of that, we suspect the presence of transient light curve shape variations mimicking small period changes."

We propose a scalable Laplacian pyramid reconstructive adversarial network (LAPRAN) that enables high-fidelity, flexible and fast CS images reconstruction. LAPRAN progressively reconstructs an image following the concept of Laplacian pyramid through multiple stages of reconstructive adversarial networks (RANs). At each pyramid level, CS measurements are fused with a contextual latent vector to generate a high-frequency image residual. Consequently, LAPRAN can produce hierarchies of reconstructed images and each with an incremental resolution and improved quality. The scalable pyramid structure of LAPRAN enables high-fidelity CS reconstruction with a flexible resolution that is adaptive to a wide range of compression ratios (CRs), which is infeasible with existing methods. Experimental results on multiple public datasets show that LAPRAN offers an average 7.47dB and 5.98dB PSNR, and an average 57.93% and 33.20% SSIM improvement compared to model-based and data-driven baselines, respectively."

However, it faces increasing criticism for perpetuating the use of overly technical and reductionist methods. As a result, novel approaches appear in the field to address more socially-oriented and interdisciplinary (SOI) perspectives on fair AI. In this paper, we take this dynamic as the starting point to study the tension between computer science (CS) and SOI research. By drawing on STS and CSCW theory, we position fair AI research as a matter of 'organizational alignment': what makes research 'doable' is the successful alignment of three levels of work organization (the social world, the laboratory, and the experiment). Based on qualitative interviews with CS researchers, we analyze the tasks, resources, and actors required for doable research in the case of fair AI. We find that CS researchers engage with SOI research to some extent, but organizational conditions, articulation work, and ambiguities of the social world constrain the doability of SOI research for them. Based on our findings, we identify and discuss problems for aligning CS and SOI as fair AI continues to evolve."

    "title": "Distributional Vision-Language Alignment by Cauchy-Schwarz Divergence",
    "summary": "Multimodal alignment is crucial for various downstream tasks such as cross-modal generation and retrieval. Previous multimodal approaches like CLIP utilize InfoNCE to maximize mutual information, primarily aligning pairwise samples across modalities while overlooking distributional differences. In addition, InfoNCE has inherent conflict in terms of alignment and uniformity in multimodality, leading to suboptimal alignment with modality gaps. To overcome the limitations, we propose CS-Aligner, a novel framework that performs distributional vision-language alignment by integrating Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence with mutual information. CS-Aligner captures both the global distribution information of each modality and the pairwise semantic relationships. We find that the CS divergence seamlessly addresses the InfoNCE's alignment-uniformity conflict and serves complementary roles with InfoNCE, yielding tighter and more precise alignment. Moreover, by introducing distributional alignment, CS-Aligner enables incorporating additional information from unpaired data and token-level representations, enhancing flexible and fine-grained alignment in practice. Experiments on text-to-image generation and cross-modality retrieval tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on vision-language alignment."

    "summary": "In the context of compressed sensing (CS), this paper considers the problem of reconstructing sparse signals with the aid of other given correlated sources as multiple side information. To address this problem, we theoretically study a generic black weighted - minimization framework and propose a reconstruction algorithm that leverages multiple side information signals (RAMSI). The proposed RAMSI algorithm computes adaptively optimal weights among the side information signals at every reconstruction iteration. In addition, we establish theoretical bounds on the number of measurements that are required to successfully reconstruct the sparse source by using black weighted - minimization . The analysis of the established bounds reveal that black weighted - minimization can achieve sharper bounds and significant performance improvements compared to classical CS. We evaluate experimentally the proposed RAMSI algorithm and the established bounds using synthetic sparse signals as well as correlated feature histograms, extracted from a multiview image database for object recognition. The obtained results show clearly that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms--- black including classical CS, minimization, Modified-CS, regularized Modified-CS, and weighted minimization ---in terms of both the theoretical bounds and the practical performance."

However, the existing CS-ASR work on MoE has yet to leverage the advantages of MoE's parameter scaling ability fully. This work proposes DLG-MoE, a Dynamic Language Group-based MoE, which can effectively handle the CS-ASR task and leverage the advantages of parameter scaling. DLG-MoE operates based on a hierarchical routing mechanism. First, the language router explicitly models the language attribute and dispatches the representations to the corresponding language expert groups. Subsequently, the unsupervised router within each language group implicitly models attributes beyond language and coordinates expert routing and collaboration. DLG-MoE outperforms the existing MoE methods on CS-ASR tasks while demonstrating great flexibility. It supports different top- inference and streaming capabilities and can also prune the model parameters flexibly to obtain a monolingual sub-model. The code has been released."

To further utilize the language information embedded in text, we also incorporate MoE layers into the decoder of SC-MoE. In addition, we introduce routers into every MoE layer of the encoder and the decoder and achieve better recognition performance. Experimental results show that the SC-MoE significantly improves CS ASR performances over baseline with comparable computational efficiency."

In this work, an RNN language model is trained using alternate batches from only monolingual English and Spanish data and the perplexity of the language model is computed. From the results, it is concluded that using alternate batches of monolingual data in training reduced the perplexity of a CS language model. The results were consistently improved using mean square error (MSE) in the output embeddings of RNN based language model. By combining both methods, perplexity is reduced from 299.63 to 80.38.

The first result is an algorithm that solves BCS when parameterized by the number of context switches (cs) and the size of the memory (m) in O*(m^(cs)2^(cs)). This is achieved by creating instances of the easier problem Shuff which we solve via fast subset convolution. We also present a lower bound for BCS of the form m^o(cs / log(cs)), based on the exponential time hypothesis. Interestingly, closing the gap means settling a conjecture that has been open since FOCS'07. Further, we prove that BCS admits no polynomial kernel. Next, we introduce a measure, called scheduling dimension, that captures the complexity of schedules. We study BCS parameterized by the scheduling dimension (sdim) and show that it can be solved in O*((2m)^(4sdim)4^t)$, where t is the number of threads. We consider variants of the problem for which we obtain (matching) upper and lower bounds."

Despite the recent advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR), CS-ASR is still a challenging task ought to the grammatical structure complexity of the phenomenon and the data scarcity of specific training corpus. In this work, we propose to leverage large language models (LLMs) and lists of hypotheses generated by an ASR to address the CS problem. Specifically, we first employ multiple well-trained ASR models for N-best hypotheses generation, with the aim of increasing the diverse and informative elements in the set of hypotheses. Next, we utilize the LLMs to learn the hypotheses-to-transcription (H2T) mapping by adding a trainable low-rank adapter. Such a generative error correction (GER) method directly predicts the accurate transcription according to its expert linguistic knowledge and N-best hypotheses, resulting in a paradigm shift from the traditional language model rescoring or error correction techniques. Experimental evidence demonstrates that GER significantly enhances CS-ASR accuracy, in terms of reduced mixed error rate (MER). Furthermore, LLMs show remarkable data efficiency for H2T learning, providing a potential solution to the data scarcity problem of CS-ASR in low-resource languages."

We train a CNN on free and publicly available daytime satellite images of the African continent from Landsat 7 to build a model for predicting local economic livelihoods. Only 5% of the satellite images can be associated with labels (which are obtained from DHS Surveys) and thus a semi-supervised approach using a GAN (similar to the approach of Salimans, et al.

Such improvements are accomplished by a co-training approach that optimizes the sensing matrix and the dictionary towards improved restricted isometry property and signal sparsity, respectively. Experimental results upon ECG signals show that the proposed method, at a compression ratio of 10x, successfully reduces the isometry constant of the trained sensing matrices by 86% against random matrices and improves the overall reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio by 15dB over conventional model-driven approaches."

    "summary": "Given one or more query vertices, Community Search (CS) aims to find densely intra-connected and loosely inter-connected structures containing query vertices. Attributed Community Search (ACS), a related problem, is more challenging since it finds communities with both cohesive structures and homogeneous vertex attributes. However, most methods for the CS task rely on inflexible pre-defined structures and studies for ACS treat each attribute independently. Moreover, the most popular ACS strategies decompose ACS into two separate sub-problems, i.e., the CS task and subsequent attribute filtering task. However, in real-world graphs, the community structure and the vertex attributes are closely correlated to each other. This correlation is vital for the ACS problem. In this paper, we propose Graph Neural Network models for both CS and ACS problems, i.e., Query Driven-GNN and Attributed Query Driven-GNN. In QD-GNN, we combine the local query-dependent structure and global graph embedding. In order to extend QD-GNN to handle attributes, we model vertex attributes as a bipartite graph and capture the relation between attributes by constructing GNNs on this bipartite graph. With a Feature Fusion operator, AQD-GNN processes the structure and attribute simultaneously and predicts communities according to each attributed query. Experiments on real-world graphs with ground-truth communities demonstrate that the proposed models outperform existing CS and ACS algorithms in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. More recently, an interactive setting for CS is proposed that allows users to adjust the predicted communities. We further verify our approaches under the interactive setting and extend to the attributed context. Our method achieves 2.37% and 6.29% improvements in F1-score than the state-of-the-art model without attributes and with attributes respectively."

Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate the agreement between the feature importance ranks associated with the studied classifiers through a case study of 18 software projects and six commonly used classifiers. We find that: 1) The computed feature importance ranks by CA and CS methods do not always strongly agree with each other. 2) The computed feature importance ranks by the studied CA methods exhibit a strong agreement including the features reported at top-1 and top-3 ranks for a given dataset and classifier, while even the commonly used CS methods yield vastly different feature importance ranks. Such findings raise concerns about the stability of conclusions across replicated studies. We further observe that the commonly used defect datasets are rife with feature interactions and these feature interactions impact the computed feature importance ranks of the CS methods (not the CA methods). We demonstrate that removing these feature interactions, even with simple methods like CFS improves agreement between the computed feature importance ranks of CA and CS methods. In light of our findings, we provide guidelines for stakeholders and practitioners when performing model interpretation and directions for future research, e.g., future research is needed to investigate the impact of advanced feature interaction removal methods on computed feature importance ranks of different CS methods."

    "title": "Sparse Volterra and Polynomial Regression Models: Recoverability and Estimation",
    "summary": "Volterra and polynomial regression models play a major role in nonlinear system identification and inference tasks. Exciting applications ranging from neuroscience to genome-wide association analysis build on these models with the additional requirement of parsimony. This requirement has high interpretative value, but unfortunately cannot be met by least-squares based or kernel regression methods. To this end, compressed sampling (CS) approaches, already successful in linear regression settings, can offer a viable alternative. The viability of CS for sparse Volterra and polynomial models is the core theme of this work. A common sparse regression task is initially posed for the two models. Building on (weighted) Lasso-based schemes, an adaptive RLS-type algorithm is developed for sparse polynomial regressions. The identifiability of polynomial models is critically challenged by dimensionality. However, following the CS principle, when these models are sparse, they could be recovered by far fewer measurements. To quantify the sufficient number of measurements for a given level of sparsity, restricted isometry properties (RIP) are investigated in commonly met polynomial regression settings, generalizing known results for their linear counterparts. The merits of the novel (weighted) adaptive CS algorithms to sparse polynomial modeling are verified through synthetic as well as real data tests for genotype-phenotype analysis."

    "title": "What Students Can Learn About Artificial Intelligence -- Recommendations for K-12 Computing Education",
    "summary": "Technological advances in the context of digital transformation are the basis for rapid developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Although AI is not a new topic in computer science (CS), recent developments are having an immense impact on everyday life and society. In consequence, everyone needs competencies to be able to adequately and competently analyze, discuss and help shape the impact, opportunities, and limits of artificial intelligence on their personal lives and our society. As a result, an increasing number of CS curricula are being extended to include the topic of AI. However, in order to integrate AI into existing CS curricula, what students can and should learn in the context of AI needs to be clarified. This has proven to be particularly difficult, considering that so far CS education research on central concepts and principles of AI lacks sufficient elaboration. Therefore, in this paper, we present a curriculum of learning objectives that addresses digital literacy and the societal perspective in particular. The learning objectives can be used to comprehensively design curricula, but also allow for analyzing current curricula and teaching materials and provide insights into the central concepts and corresponding competencies of AI."

    "summary": "Considering the interaction through mutual interference of the different radio devices, the channel selection (CS) problem in decentralized parallel multiple access channels can be modeled by strategic-form games. Here, we show that the CS problem is a potential game (PG) and thus the fictitious play (FP) converges to a Nash equilibrium (NE) either in pure or mixed strategies. Using a 2-player 2-channel game, it is shown that convergence in mixed strategies might lead to cycles of action profiles which lead to individual spectral efficiencies (SE) which are worse than the SE at the worst NE in mixed and pure strategies. Finally, exploiting the fact that the CS problem is a PG and an aggregation game, we present a method to implement FP with local information and minimum feedback."

    "summary": "Machine translation (MT) in the medical domain plays a pivotal role in enhancing healthcare quality and disseminating medical knowledge. Despite advancements in English-Thai MT technology, common MT approaches often underperform in the medical field due to their inability to precisely translate medical terminologies. Our research prioritizes not merely improving translation accuracy but also maintaining medical terminology in English within the translated text through code-switched (CS) translation. We developed a method to produce CS medical translation data, fine-tuned a CS translation model with this data, and evaluated its performance against strong baselines, such as Google Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and GPT-3.5/GPT-4. Our model demonstrated competitive performance in automatic metrics and was highly favored in human preference evaluations. Our evaluation result also shows that medical professionals significantly prefer CS translations that maintain critical English terms accurately, even if it slightly compromises fluency.

    "title": "Visualizing High-Dimensional Configuration Spaces: A Comprehensive Analytical Approach",
    "summary": "The representation of a Configuration Space C plays a vital role in accelerating the finding of a collision-free path for sampling-based motion planners where the majority of computation time is spent in collision checking of states. Traditionally, planners evaluate C's representations through limited evaluations of collision-free paths using the collision checker or by reducing the dimensionality of C for visualization. However, a collision checker may indicate high accuracy even when only a subset of the original C is represented; limiting the motion planner's ability to find paths comparable to those in the original C. Additionally, dealing with high-dimensional Cs is challenging, as qualitative evaluations become increasingly difficult in dimensions higher than three, where reduced-dimensional C evaluation may decrease accuracy in cluttered environments. In this paper, we present a novel approach for visualizing representations of high-dimensional Cs of manipulator robots in a 2D format. We provide a new tool for qualitative evaluation of high-dimensional Cs approximations without reducing the original dimension. This enhances our ability to compare the accuracy and coverage of two different high-dimensional Cs. Leveraging the kinematic chain of manipulator robots and human color perception, we show the efficacy of our method using a 7-degree-of-freedom CS of a manipulator robot. This visualization offers qualitative insights into the joint boundaries of the robot and the coverage of collision state combinations without reducing the dimensionality of the original data. To support our claim, we conduct a numerical evaluation of the proposed visualization."

    "summary": "This paper represents a pilot study examining learners who are new to computer science (CS). Subjects are taught to program in one of two virtual reality (VR) applications developed by the researcher that use interactable objects representing programming concepts. The different versions are the basis for two experimental groups. One version of the app uses textual code for the interactable programming objects and the other version uses everyday objects as visual metaphors for the CS concepts the programming objects represent. For the two experimental groups, the study compares the results of self-efficacy surveys and CS knowledge tests taken before and after the VR activity intervention. An attitudinal survey taken after the intervention examines learners' sense of productivity and engagement with the VR activity. While further iterations of the study with a larger sample size would be needed to confirm any results, preliminary findings from the pilot study suggest that both methods of teaching basic programming concepts in VR can lead to increased levels of self-efficacy and knowledge regarding CS, and can contribute toward productive mental states."

    "summary": "We propose a) a Language Agnostic end-to-end Speech Translation model (LAST), and b) a data augmentation strategy to increase code-switching (CS) performance. With increasing globalization, multiple languages are increasingly used interchangeably during fluent speech. Such CS complicates traditional speech recognition and translation, as we must recognize which language was spoken first and then apply a language-dependent recognizer and subsequent translation component to generate the desired target language output. Such a pipeline introduces latency and errors. In this paper, we eliminate the need for that, by treating speech recognition and translation as one unified end-to-end speech translation problem. By training LAST with both input languages, we decode speech into one target language, regardless of the input language. LAST delivers comparable recognition and speech translation accuracy in monolingual usage, while reducing latency and error rate considerably when CS is observed."

    "title": "VLSI Friendly Framework for Scalable Video Coding based on Compressed Sensing",
    "summary": "This paper presents a new VLSI friendly framework for scalable video coding based on Compressed Sensing (CS). It achieves scalability through 3-Dimensional Discrete Wavelet Transform (3-D DWT) and better compression ratio by exploiting the inherent sparsity of the high-frequency wavelet sub-bands through CS. By using 3-D DWT and a proposed adaptive measurement scheme called AMS at the encoder, one can succeed in improving the compression ratio and reducing the complexity of the decoder. The proposed video codec uses only 7% of the total number of multipliers needed in a conventional CS-based video coding system. A codebook of Bernoulli matrices with different sizes corresponding to the predefined sparsity levels is maintained at both the encoder and the decoder. Based on the calculated l0-norm of the input vector, one of the sixteen possible Bernoulli matrices will be selected for taking the CS measurements and its index will be transmitted along with the measurements. Based on this index, the corresponding Bernoulli matrix has been used in CS reconstruction algorithm to get back the high-frequency wavelet sub-bands at the decoder. At the decoder, a new Enhanced Approximate Message Passing (EAMP) algorithm has been proposed to reconstruct the wavelet coefficients and apply the inverse wavelet transform for restoring back the video frames. Simulation results have established the superiority of the proposed framework over the existing schemes and have increased its suitability for VLSI implementation. Moreover, the coded video is found to be scalable with an increase in a number of levels of wavelet decomposition."

    "summary": "A rich variety of nematic/smectic orders in Fe-based superconductors is an important unsolved problem in strongly correlated electron systems. A unified understanding of these orders has been investigated for the last decade. In this article, we explain the symmetry nematic transition in FeSe Te , the symmetry nematicity in AFe As (A=Cs, Rb), and the smectic state in BaFe As based on the same framework. We investigate the quantum interference mechanism between spin fluctuations by developing the density wave equation. The observed rich variety of nematic/smectic orders is naturally understood in this mechanism. The nematic/smectic orders depend on the characteristic shape and topology of the Fermi surface (FS) of each compound. (i) In FeSe Te , each FS is very small and the dxy-orbital hole pocket is below the Fermi level. In this case, the small spin fluctuations on three dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals cooperatively lead to the nematic order. The experimental Lifshitz transition below the nematic transition temperature is naturally reproduced. (ii) In BaFe As , the dxy-orbital hole pocket emerges around M point, and each FS is relatively large. The strong spin fluctuations due to the dxy-orbital nesting give rise to the nematic order and the smectic order, and the latter transition temperature ( ) exceeds the former one . (iii) In heavily hole-doped AFe As , the large dxy-orbital hole pocket and the four tiny Dirac pockets appear due to the hole-doping. The nematic bond order emerges on the dxy-orbital hole pocket due to the same interference mechanism. The present paramagnon interference mechanism provides a unified explanation of why the variety of nematic/smectic orders in Fe-based superconductors is so rich, based on the well-established fermiology of Fe-based superconductors."

This study responds to the growing need to systematically revisit and reorganize decades of Taiwan based CS scholarship by proposing an AI assisted approach that transforms unstructured academic texts into structured, interactive knowledge representations. We apply generative AI (GAI) techniques and large language models (LLMs) to extract and standardize entity relation triples from 1,367 peer reviewed CS articles published between 1996 and 2019. These triples are then visualized through a lightweight D3.js based system, forming the foundation of a domain specific knowledge graph and vector database for the field. This infrastructure allows users to explore conceptual nodes and semantic relationships across the corpus, revealing previously uncharted intellectual trajectories, thematic clusters, and research gaps. By decomposing textual content into graph structured knowledge units, our system enables a paradigm shift from linear text consumption to network based knowledge navigation. In doing so, it enhances scholarly access to CS literature while offering a scalable, data driven alternative to traditional ontology construction. This work not only demonstrates how generative AI can augment area studies and digital humanities but also highlights its potential to support a reimagined scholarly infrastructure for regional knowledge systems."

    "title": "Compilation of Fault-Tolerant Quantum Heuristics for Combinatorial Optimization",
    "summary": "Here we explore which heuristic quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization might be most practical to try out on a small fault-tolerant quantum computer. We compile circuits for several variants of quantum accelerated simulated annealing including those using qubitization or Szegedy walks to quantize classical Markov chains and those simulating spectral gap amplified Hamiltonians encoding a Gibbs state. We also optimize fault-tolerant realizations of the adiabatic algorithm, quantum enhanced population transfer, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, and other approaches. Many of these methods are bottlenecked by calls to the same subroutines; thus, optimized circuits for those primitives should be of interest regardless of which heuristic is most effective in practice. We compile these bottlenecks for several families of optimization problems and report for how long and for what size systems one can perform these heuristics in the surface code given a range of resource budgets. Our results discourage the notion that any quantum optimization heuristic realizing only a quadratic speedup will achieve an advantage over classical algorithms on modest superconducting qubit surface code processors without significant improvements in the implementation of the surface code. For instance, under quantum-favorable assumptions (e.g., that the quantum algorithm requires exactly quadratically fewer steps), our analysis suggests that quantum accelerated simulated annealing would require roughly a day and a million physical qubits to optimize spin glasses that could be solved by classical simulated annealing in about four CPU-minutes."

    "summary": "Recently, language identity information has been utilized to improve the performance of end-to-end code-switching (CS) speech recognition. However, previous works use an additional language identification (LID) model as an auxiliary module, which causes the system complex. In this work, we propose an improved recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) model with language bias to alleviate the problem. We use the language identities to bias the model to predict the CS points. This promotes the model to learn the language identity information directly from transcription, and no additional LID model is needed. We evaluate the approach on a Mandarin-English CS corpus SEAME. Compared to our RNN-T baseline, the proposed method can achieve 16.2% and 12.9% relative error reduction on two test sets, respectively."

    "title": "Making sense of randomness: an approach for fast recovery of compressively sensed signals",
    "summary": "In compressed sensing (CS) framework, a signal is sampled below Nyquist rate, and the acquired compressed samples are generally random in nature. However, for efficient estimation of the actual signal, the sensing matrix must preserve the relative distances among the acquired compressed samples. Provided this condition is fulfilled, we show that CS samples will preserve the envelope of the actual signal even at different compression ratios. Exploiting this envelope preserving property of CS samples, we propose a new fast dictionary learning (DL) algorithm which is able to extract prototype signals from compressive samples for efficient sparse representation and recovery of signals. These prototype signals are orthogonal intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) extracted using empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which is one of the popular methods to capture the envelope of a signal. The extracted IMFs are used to build the dictionary without even comprehending the original signal or the sensing matrix. Moreover, one can build the dictionary on-line as new CS samples are available. In particularly, to recover first signals ( ) at the decoder, one can build the dictionary in just operations, that is far less as compared to existing approaches. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated experimentally for recovery of speech signals."

We also study the pre-maximum (B-V) color evolution by comparing our data with standard delayed detonation and pulsational delayed detonation models, and show that the Ni56 masses of the models that fit the (B-V) colors are consistent with those derived from the bolometric LC fitting. We find similar correlations between the ejecta parameters (e.g. ejecta mass, or Ni56 mass vs decline rate) as published recently by Scalzo et al. (2019)."

In addition, we designed two immersive environments for empirical studies where participants are asked to complete the questionnaire and describe (orally) the degree of discomfort during their gaming experience. Our data was achieved through 84 individuals on different days, using VR devices.

Education and workforce support programs with the intention to promote underrepresented students' persistence in CS exist, which teach skills, inform of career options, and grow students' network in CS. Studies demonstrate these programs' effectiveness as it relates to changes in affective outcomes, such as participants' confidence in CS skills and attitudes towards CS jobs. However, programs' longitudinal impact on participants' build-up of social capital in CS, and the resulting social capital's influence on their persistence in CS, remain unexplored. Motivated by the literature that associates demographic identifiers with access to social capital, and students' access to developmental relationships and career resources (social capital) in CS with their persistence, this study explores a CS support program's impact on persistence through capital building. We focus on Google's CSSI, which provided graduating high school students with a 3-week-long introduction to CS. We use interviews with participants who are now 2-5 years out of the program to study CSSI's impact on their social capital and long-term CS persistence. Thematic analysis reveals three program elements that influenced students' build-up of social capital, and that the resulting persistence was realized through students' progress towards internships and goals for paying-it-forward in CS. These findings inform our recommendations that future support programs and educational settings consider mentorship centered on socioemotional support, opportunities for collaboration, and time for fun social activities. Additional suggestions center on engaging socially-oriented individuals with CS support programs. These insights inform CS educators on design choices that can encourage the persistence of underrepresented students in CS."

Our evaluation suggests that WikiCSSH outperforms alternative CS vocabularies in terms of vocabulary size as well as the performance of lexicon-based key-phrase extraction from scholarly data. WikiCSSH can further distinguish between coarse-grained versus fine-grained CS concepts. The outlined workflow can serve as a template for building hierarchically-organized subject heading vocabularies for other domains that are covered in Wikipedia."

We advocate to integrate cybersecurity as a crosscutting concept in CS curricula, which is also consistent with latest cybersecurity curricular guidelines, e.g., CSEC2017. We describe our experience of implementing this crosscutting intervention across three undergraduate core CS courses at a leading technical university in Europe between 2018 and 2023, collectively educating over 2200 students. The security education was incorporated within CS courses using a partnership between the responsible course instructor and a security expert, i.e., the security expert (after consultation with course instructors) developed and taught lectures covering multiple CSEC2017 knowledge areas. This created a complex dynamic between three stakeholders: the course instructor, the security expert, and the students. We reflect on our intervention from the perspective of the three stakeholders -- we conducted a post-course survey to collect student perceptions, and semi-supervised interviews with responsible course instructors and the security expert to gauge their experience. We found that while the students were extremely enthusiastic about the security content and retained its impact several years later, the misaligned incentives for the instructors and the security expert made it difficult to sustain this intervention without organizational support. By identifying limitations in our intervention, we suggest ideas for sustaining it."

However, RAG, particularly multi-modal RAG, can introduce new hallucination sources: (i) the retrieval process may select irrelevant pieces (e.g., documents, images) as raw context from the database, and (ii) retrieved images are processed into text-based context via vision-language models (VLMs) or directly used by multi-modal language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4o, which may hallucinate. To address this, we propose a novel framework to evaluate the reliability of multi-modal RAG using two performance measures: (i) the relevancy score (RS), assessing the relevance of retrieved entries to the query, and (ii) the correctness score (CS), evaluating the accuracy of the generated response. We train RS and CS models using a ChatGPT-derived database and human evaluator samples. Results show that both models achieve ~88% accuracy on test data. Additionally, we construct a 5000-sample human-annotated database evaluating the relevancy of retrieved pieces and the correctness of response statements. Our RS model aligns with human preferences 20% more often than CLIP in retrieval, and our CS model matches human preferences ~91% of the time. Finally, we assess various RAG systems' selection and generation performances using RS and CS."

In cellular networks, CS is accomplished via synchronization signals (SS) broadcasted by gNB. 5G 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) specifications offer a detailed discussion on the SS generation at gNB but a limited understanding of their blind search, and detection is available. Unlike 4G, 5G SS may not be transmitted at the center of carrier frequency and their frequency location is unknown to UE. In this work, we demonstrate the 5G CS by designing 3GPP compatible hardware realization of the physical layer (PHY) of the gNB transmitter and UE receiver. The proposed SS detection explores a novel down-sampling approach resulting in a significant reduction in complexity and latency. Via detailed performance analysis, we analyze the functional correctness, computational complexity, and latency of the proposed approach for different word lengths, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and down-sampling factors. We demonstrate the complete CS functionality on GNU Radio-based RFNoC framework and USRP-FPGA platform. The 3GPP compatibility and demonstration on hardware strengthen the commercial significance of the proposed work."

In this work, the CS problem, as a human-in-the-loop computation problem, is modeled and analyzed in an information theoretic rate-distortion framework. The purpose is to identify the ultimate fidelity that one can achieve by any form of query from the crowd and any decoding (inference) algorithm with a given budget. The results are established by a joint source channel (de)coding scheme, which represent the query scheme and inference, over parallel noisy channels, which model workers with imperfect skill levels. We also present and analyze a query scheme dubbed -ary incidence coding and study optimized query pricing in this setting."

Adaptation on the pre-trained multi-lingual model has shown promising performance for CS-ASR. In this paper, we adapt Whisper, which is a large-scale multilingual pre-trained speech recognition model, to CS from both encoder and decoder parts. First, we propose an encoder refiner to enhance the encoder's capacity of intra-sentence swithching. Second, we propose using two sets of language-aware adapters with different language prompt embeddings to achieve language-specific decoding information in each decoder layer. Then, a fusion module is added to fuse the language-aware decoding. The experimental results using the SEAME dataset show that, compared with the baseline model, the proposed approach achieves a relative MER reduction of 4.1% and 7.2% on the dev_man and dev_sge test sets, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Through experiments, we found that the proposed method significantly improves the performance on non-native language in CS speech, indicating that our approach enables Whisper to better distinguish between the two languages."

    "summary": "Framing is a process of emphasizing a certain aspect of an issue over the others, nudging readers or listeners towards different positions on the issue even without making a biased argument. Here, we propose FrameAxis, a method for characterizing documents by identifying the most relevant semantic axes (\"microframes\") that are overrepresented in the text using word embedding. Our unsupervised approach can be readily applied to large datasets because it does not require manual annotations. It can also provide nuanced insights by considering a rich set of semantic axes. FrameAxis is designed to quantitatively tease out two important dimensions of how microframes are used in the text. Microframe bias captures how biased the text is on a certain microframe, and microframe intensity shows how actively a certain microframe is used. Together, they offer a detailed characterization of the text. We demonstrate that microframes with the highest bias and intensity well align with sentiment, topic, and partisan spectrum by applying FrameAxis to multiple datasets from restaurant reviews to political news. The existing domain knowledge can be incorporated into FrameAxis by using custom microframes and by using FrameAxis as an iterative exploratory analysis instrument. Additionally, we propose methods for explaining the results of FrameAxis at the level of individual words and documents. Our method may accelerate scalable and sophisticated computational analyses of framing across disciplines."

We explore Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT), a parameter-efficient method to enhance CS ASR while preserving prior knowledge. We evaluate two strategies: (1) full fine-tuning (FFT) of both soft prompts and the entire Whisper model, demonstrating improved cross-lingual capabilities compared to traditional methods, and (2) adhering to SPT's original design by freezing model parameters and only training soft prompts. Additionally, we introduce SPT4ASR, a combination of different SPT variants. Experiments on the SEAME and ASRU2019 datasets show that deep prompt tuning is the most effective SPT approach, and our SPT4ASR methods achieve further error reductions in CS ASR, maintaining parameter efficiency similar to LoRA, without degrading performance on existing languages."

We found that the source shows a significant optical near-infrared variability, and the current brightness minimum has not completely finished yet. If the present dimming originates from the same orbiting dust clump that caused a similar brightness variation in 2012, than our results suggest a viscous spreading of the dust particles along the orbit. Another scenario is that the current minimum is caused by a dust structure, that is entering and leaving the inner part of the system. The WISE measurements could be consistent with this scenario. Our long-term data, as well as an accretion disk modeling hint at a general fading of V582 Aur, suggesting that the source will reach the quiescent level in 80 years."

    "title": "Regular Expressions in a CS Formal Languages Course",
    "summary": "Regular expressions in an Automata Theory and Formal Languages course are mostly treated as a theoretical topic. That is, to some degree their mathematical properties and their role to describe languages is discussed. This approach fails to capture the interest of most Computer Science students. It is a missed opportunity to engage Computer Science students that are far more motivated by practical applications of theory. To this end, regular expressions may be discussed as the description of an algorithm to generate words in a language that is easily programmed. This article describes a programming-based methodology to introduce students to regular expressions in an Automata Theory and Formal Languages course. The language of instruction is FSM in which there is a regular expression type. Thus, facilitating the study of regular expressions and of algorithms based on regular expressions."

    "summary": "We propose a Bayesian method for distributed sequential localization of mobile networks composed of both cooperative agents and noncooperative objects. Our method provides a consistent combination of cooperative self-localization (CS) and distributed tracking (DT). Multiple mobile agents and objects are localized and tracked using measurements between agents and objects and between agents. For a distributed operation and low complexity, we combine particle-based belief propagation with a consensus or gossip scheme. High localization accuracy is achieved through a probabilistic information transfer between the CS and DT parts of the underlying factor graph. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in both agent self-localization and object localization performance compared to separate CS and DT, and very good scaling properties with respect to the numbers of agents and objects."

    "title": "Selection and improvement of product formulae for best performance of quantum simulation",
    "summary": "Quantum algorithms for simulation of Hamiltonian evolution are often based on product formulae. The fractal methods give a systematic way to find arbitrarily high-order product formulae, but result in a large number of exponentials. On the other hand, product formulae with fewer exponentials can be found by numerical solution of simultaneous nonlinear equations. It is also possible to reduce the cost of long-time simulations by processing, where a kernel is repeated and a processor need only be applied at the beginning and end of the simulation. In this work, we found thousands of new product formulae, and numerically tested these formulae, together with many formulae from prior literature. We provide methods to fairly compare product formulae of different lengths and different orders. For the case of 8th order, we have found new product formulae with exceptional performance, about two orders of magnitude better accuracy than prior work, both in the processed and non-processed cases. The processed product formula provides the best performance due to being shorter than the non-processed product formula. It outperforms all other tested product formulae over a range of many orders of magnitude in system parameters (time) and (allowable error). That includes reasonable combinations of parameters to be used in quantum algorithms, where the size of the simulation is large enough to be classically intractable, but not so large it takes an impractically long time on a quantum computer."

    "summary": "The infrared-radio correlation (IRRC) underpins many commonly used radio luminosity-star formation rate (SFR) calibrations. In preparation for the new generation of radio surveys we revisit the IRRC of low- galaxies by (a) drawing on the best currently available IR and 1.4 GHz radio photometry, plus ancillary data over the widest possible area, and (b) carefully assessing potential systematics. We compile a catalogue of 9,500 z 0.2 galaxies and derive their 1.4 GHz radio ( ), total IR, and monochromatic IR luminosities in up to seven bands, allowing us to parameterize the wavelength-dependence of monochromatic IRRCs from 22-500 m. For the first time for low- samples, we quantify how poorly matched IR and radio survey depths bias measured median IR/radio ratios, , and discuss the level of biasing expected for low-z IRRC studies in ASKAP/MeerKAT fields. For our subset of 2,000 high-confidence star-forming galaxies we find a median of 2.54 (scatter: 0.17 dex). We show that correlates with , implying a non-linear IRRC with slope 1.11 0.01. Our new -SFR calibration, which incorporates this non-linearity, reproduces SFRs from panchromatic SED fits substantially better than previous IRRC-based recipes. Finally, we match the evolutionary slope of recently measured -redshift trends without having to invoke redshift evolution of the IRRC. In this framework, the redshift evolution of reported at GHz frequencies in the literature is the consequence of a partial, redshift-dependent sampling of a non-linear IRRC obeyed by low- and distant galaxies."

Despite the growing integration of CS in schools, there is a lack of consensus on the precise definition of CT in general and decomposition in particular. While decomposition is commonly referred to as the starting point of (computational) problem-solving, algorithmic solution formulation often receives more attention in the classroom, while decomposition remains rather unexplored. This study presents \"CTSKills\", a web-based skill assessment tool developed to measure students' problem decomposition skills. With the data collected from 75 students in grades 4-9, this research aims to contribute to a baseline of students' decomposition proficiency in compulsory education. Furthermore, a thorough understanding of a given problem is becoming increasingly important with the advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools that can effectively support the process of formulating algorithms. This study highlights the importance of problem decomposition as a key skill in K-12 CS education to foster more adept problem solvers."

    "title": "Learning the Regularization in DCE-MR Image Reconstruction for Functional Imaging of Kidneys",
    "summary": "Kidney DCE-MRI aims at both qualitative assessment of kidney anatomy and quantitative assessment of kidney function by estimating the tracer kinetic (TK) model parameters. Accurate estimation of TK model parameters requires an accurate measurement of the arterial input function (AIF) with high temporal resolution. Accelerated imaging is used to achieve high temporal resolution, which yields under-sampling artifacts in the reconstructed images. Compressed sensing (CS) methods offer a variety of reconstruction options. Most commonly, sparsity of temporal differences is encouraged for regularization to reduce artifacts. Increasing regularization in CS methods removes the ambient artifacts but also over-smooths the signal temporally which reduces the parameter estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a single image trained deep neural network to reduce MRI under-sampling artifacts without reducing the accuracy of functional imaging markers. Instead of regularizing with a penalty term in optimization, we promote regularization by generating images from a lower dimensional representation. In this manuscript we motivate and explain the lower dimensional input design. We compare our approach to CS reconstructions with multiple regularization weights. Proposed approach results in kidney biomarkers that are highly correlated with the ground truth markers estimated using the CS reconstruction which was optimized for functional analysis. At the same time, the proposed approach reduces the artifacts in the reconstructed images."

We provide theoretical analysis on the performance of both the classical compressive sensing (CS) approach and the proposed distributed CS (DCS)-based approach to data acquisition for EH IoT. Moreover, we perform an in-depth comparison of the proposed DCS-based approach against the distributed source coding (DSC) system. These performance characterizations and comparisons embody the effect of various system phenomena and parameters including signal correlation, EH correlation, network size, and energy availability level. Our results unveil that, the proposed approach offers significant increase in data gathering capability with respect to the CS-based approach, and offers a substantial reduction of the mean-squared error distortion with respect to the DSC system."

    "summary": "Adapting large language models to multiple tasks can cause cross-skill interference, where improvements for one skill degrade another. While methods such as LoRA impose orthogonality constraints at the weight level, they do not fully address interference in hidden-state representations. We propose Compositional Subspace Representation Fine-tuning (CS-ReFT), a novel representation-based approach that learns multiple orthonormal subspace transformations, each specializing in a distinct skill, and composes them via a lightweight router. By isolating these subspace edits in the hidden state, rather than weight matrices, CS-ReFT prevents cross-task conflicts more effectively. On the AlpacaEval benchmark, applying CS-ReFT to Llama-2-7B achieves a 93.94% win rate, surpassing GPT-3.5 Turbo (86.30%) while requiring only 0.0098% of model parameters. These findings show that specialized representation edits, composed via a simple router, significantly enhance multi-task instruction following with minimal overhead."

    "summary": "Code-switching (CS), the alternating use of two or more languages, challenges automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to scarce training data and linguistic similarities. The lack of dedicated CS datasets limits ASR performance, as most models rely on monolingual or mixed-language corpora that fail to reflect real-world CS patterns. This issue is critical in multilingual societies where CS occurs in informal and formal settings. A key example is Catalan-Spanish CS, widely used in media and parliamentary speeches. In this work, we improve ASR for Catalan-Spanish CS by exploring three strategies: (1) generating synthetic CS data, (2) concatenating monolingual audio, and (3) leveraging real CS data with language tokens. We extract CS data from Catalan speech corpora and fine-tune OpenAI's Whisper models, making them available on Hugging Face. Results show that combining a modest amount of synthetic CS data with the dominant language token yields the best transcription performance."

    "title": "Approximation Algorithms for Model-Based Compressive Sensing",
    "summary": "Compressive Sensing (CS) stipulates that a sparse signal can be recovered from a small number of linear measurements, and that this recovery can be performed efficiently in polynomial time. The framework of model-based compressive sensing (model-CS) leverages additional structure in the signal and prescribes new recovery schemes that can reduce the number of measurements even further. However, model-CS requires an algorithm that solves the model-projection problem: given a query signal, produce the signal in the model that is also closest to the query signal. Often, this optimization can be computationally very expensive. Moreover, an approximation algorithm is not sufficient for this optimization task. As a result, the model-projection problem poses a fundamental obstacle for extending model-CS to many interesting models. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that we call approximation-tolerant model-based compressive sensing. This framework includes a range of algorithms for sparse recovery that require only approximate solutions for the model-projection problem. In essence, our work removes the aforementioned obstacle to model-based compressive sensing, thereby extending the applicability of model-CS to a much wider class of models. We instantiate this new framework for the Constrained Earth Mover Distance (CEMD) model, which is particularly useful for signal ensembles where the positions of the nonzero coefficients do not change significantly as a function of spatial (or temporal) location. We develop novel approximation algorithms for both the maximization and the minimization versions of the model-projection problem via graph optimization techniques. Leveraging these algorithms into our framework results in a nearly sample-optimal sparse recovery scheme for the CEMD model."

    "summary": "For reaching dependable high-precision clock synchronization (CS) upon IoT networks, the distributed CS paradigm adopted in ultra-high reliable systems and the master-slave CS paradigm adopted in high-performance but unreliable systems are integrated. Meanwhile, traditional internal clock synchronization is also integrated with external time references to achieve efficient stabilization. Low network connectivity, low complexity, high precision, and high reliability are all considered. To tolerate permanent failures, the Byzantine CS is integrated with the common CS protocols. To tolerate transient failures, the self-stabilizing Byzantine CS is also extended upon open-world IoT networks. With these, the proposed intro-stabilizing Byzantine CS solution can establish and maintain synchronization with arbitrary initial states in the presence of permanent Byzantine faults. With the formal analysis and numerical simulations, it is shown that the best of the CS solutions provided for the ultra-high reliable systems and the high-performance unreliable systems can be well integrated upon IoT networks to derive dependable high-precision CS even across the traditional closed safety-boundary."

We investigate Compressive Sensing (CS) as a way to reduce the size of the data as it is being stored. CS works by sampling the data on the computational cluster within an alternative function space such as wavelet bases, and then reconstructing back to the original space on visualization platforms. While much work has gone into exploring CS on structured data sets, such as image data, we investigate its usefulness for point clouds such as unstructured mesh datasets found in many finite element simulations. We sample using second generation wavelets (SGW) and reconstruct using the Stagewise Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (StOMP) algorithm. We analyze the compression ratios achievable and quality of reconstructed results at each compression rate. We are able to achieve compression ratios between 10 and 30 on moderate size datasets with minimal visual deterioration as a result of the lossy compression."

    "summary": "The pre-trained conversational models still fail to capture the implicit commonsense (CS) knowledge hidden in the dialogue interaction, even though they were pre-trained with an enormous dataset. In order to build a dialogue agent with CS capability, we firstly inject external knowledge into a pre-trained conversational model to establish basic commonsense through efficient Adapter tuning (Section 4). Secondly, we propose the ``two-way learning'' method to enable the bidirectional relationship between CS knowledge and sentence pairs so that the model can generate a sentence given the CS triplets, also generate the underlying CS knowledge given a sentence (Section 5). Finally, we leverage this integrated CS capability to improve open-domain dialogue response generation so that the dialogue agent is capable of understanding the CS knowledge hidden in dialogue history on top of inferring related other knowledge to further guide response generation (Section 6). The experiment results demonstrate that CS\\_Adapter fusion helps DialoGPT to be able to generate series of CS knowledge. And the DialoGPT+CS\\_Adapter response model adapted from CommonGen training can generate underlying CS triplets that fits better to dialogue context."

    "title": "Cross-Modal Retrieval with Cauchy-Schwarz Divergence",
    "summary": "Effective cross-modal retrieval requires robust alignment of heterogeneous data types. Most existing methods focus on bi-modal retrieval tasks and rely on distributional alignment techniques such as Kullback-Leibler divergence, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and correlation alignment. However, these methods often suffer from critical limitations, including numerical instability, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and their inability to capture the full structure of the underlying distributions. In this paper, we introduce the Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence, a hyperparameter-free measure that improves both training stability and retrieval performance. We further propose a novel Generalized CS (GCS) divergence inspired by Hölder's inequality. This extension enables direct alignment of three or more modalities within a unified mathematical framework through a bidirectional circular comparison scheme, eliminating the need for exhaustive pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both bi-modal and tri-modal retrieval tasks. The code of our CS/GCS divergence is publicly available at https://github.com/JiahaoZhang666/CSD."

    "summary": "Cued Speech (CS) is a pure visual coding method used by hearing-impaired people that combines lip reading with several specific hand shapes to make the spoken language visible. Automatic CS recognition (ACSR) seeks to transcribe visual cues of speech into text, which can help hearing-impaired people to communicate effectively. The visual information of CS contains lip reading and hand cueing, thus the fusion of them plays an important role in ACSR. However, most previous fusion methods struggle to capture the global dependency present in long sequence inputs of multi-modal CS data. As a result, these methods generally fail to learn the effective cross-modal relationships that contribute to the fusion. Recently, attention-based transformers have been a prevalent idea for capturing the global dependency over the long sequence in multi-modal fusion, but existing multi-modal fusion transformers suffer from both poor recognition accuracy and inefficient computation for the ACSR task. To address these problems, we develop a novel computation and parameter efficient multi-modal fusion transformer by proposing a novel Token-Importance-Aware Attention mechanism (TIAA), where a token utilization rate (TUR) is formulated to select the important tokens from the multi-modal streams. More precisely, TIAA firstly models the modality-specific fine-grained temporal dependencies over all tokens of each modality, and then learns the efficient cross-modal interaction for the modality-shared coarse-grained temporal dependencies over the important tokens of different modalities. Besides, a light-weight gated hidden projection is designed to control the feature flows of TIAA. The resulting model, named Economical Cued Speech Fusion Transformer (EcoCued), achieves state-of-the-art performance on all existing CS datasets, compared with existing transformer-based fusion methods and ACSR fusion methods."

EMAT introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5 and COCO-20 datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters. Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios."

Recent studies show that it is feasible to use a fixed neural network for data embedding and extraction. Such Fixed Neural Network Steganography (FNNS) demonstrates favorable performance without the need for training networks, making it more practical for real-world applications. However, the stego-images generated by the existing FNNS methods exhibit high distortion, which is prone to be detected by steganalysis tools. To deal with this issue, we propose a Cover-separable Fixed Neural Network Steganography, namely Cs-FNNS. In Cs-FNNS, we propose a Steganographic Perturbation Search (SPS) algorithm to directly encode the secret data into an imperceptible perturbation, which is combined with an AI-generated cover image for transmission. Through accessing the same deep generative models, the receiver could reproduce the cover image using a pre-agreed key, to separate the perturbation in the stego-image for data decoding. such an encoding/decoding strategy focuses on the secret data and eliminates the disturbance of the cover images, hence achieving a better performance. We apply our Cs-FNNS to the steganographic field that hiding secret images within cover images. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of visual quality and undetectability. Moreover, we show the flexibility of our Cs-FNNS in terms of hiding multiple secret images for different receivers."

The results have shown that LLMs are highly effective in generating code for introductory Computer Science (CS) courses. However, there is a gap in research on evaluating LLMs' ability to generate code that solves advanced programming assignments. In this work, we evaluate the ability of four LLM tools to solve programming assignments from advanced CS courses in three popular programming languages, Java, Python, and C. We manually select 12 problems, three problems from introductory courses as the baseline and nine programming assignments from second- and third-year CS courses. To evaluate the LLM-generated code, we generate a test suite of 1000 test cases per problem and analyze the program output. Our evaluation shows that although LLMs are highly effective in generating source code for introductory programming courses, solving advanced programming assignments is more challenging. Nonetheless, in many cases, LLMs identify the base problem and provide partial solutions that may be useful to CS students. Furthermore, our results may provide useful guidance for teachers of advanced programming courses on how to design programming assignments."

The PIT aggregates requests for a given content that arrive within the download delay and thus brings an additional reduction in upstream bandwidth usage beyond that due to CS hits. We extend prior work on caching with non-zero download delay (non-ZDD) by proposing a novel mathematical framework that is more easily applicable to general traffic models and by considering alternative cache insertion policies. Specifically we evaluate the use of an LRU filter to improve CS hit rate performance in this non-ZDD context. We also consider the impact of time locality in demand due to finite content lifetimes. The models are used to quantify the impact of the PIT on upstream bandwidth reduction, demonstrating notably that this is significant only for relatively small content catalogues or high average request rate per content. We further explore how the effectiveness of the filter with finite content lifetimes depends on catalogue size and traffic intensity."

This is relevant to almost any imaging modality, and in this paper we focus on CS in photoacoustic projection imaging (PAPI) with integrating line detectors (ILDs). Aim: Our previous research involved rather general CS measurements, where each ILD can contribute to any measurement. In the real world, however, the design of CS measurements is subject to practical constraints. In this research, we aim at a CS-PAPI system where each measurement involves only a subset of ILDs, and which can be implemented in a cost-effective manner. Approach: We extend the existing PAPI with a self-developed CS unit. The system provides structured CS matrices for which the existing recovery theory cannot be applied directly. A random search strategy is applied to select the CS measurement matrix within this class for which we obtain exact sparse recovery. Results: We implement a CS PAPI system for a compression factor of , where specific measurements are made on separate groups of 16 ILDs. We algorithmically design optimal CS measurements that have proven sparse CS capabilities. Numerical experiments are used to support our results.

This increasing prominence demands the need to model CS languages for critical downstream tasks. A major problem in this domain is the dearth of annotated data and a substantial corpora to train large scale neural models. Generating vast amounts of quality text assists several down stream tasks that heavily rely on language modeling such as speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis etc,. We present a novel vantage point of CS to be style variations between both the participating languages. Our approach does not need any external annotations such as lexical language ids. It mainly relies on easily obtainable monolingual corpora without any parallel alignment and a limited set of naturally CS sentences. We propose a two-stage generative adversarial training approach where the first stage generates competitive negative examples for CS and the second stage generates more realistic CS sentences. We present our experiments on the following pairs of languages: Spanish-English, Mandarin-English, Hindi-English and Arabic-French. We show that the trends in metrics for generated CS move closer to real CS data in each of the above language pairs through the dual stage training process. We believe this viewpoint of CS as style variations opens new perspectives for modeling various tasks in CS text."

Gender differences in interests, sense-of belonging, self-efficacy, and engagement in CS are already present at an early age. This article presents an overview of gender stereotypes in CS and summarizes negative impressions female students between 12 and 15 experience during CS classes, as well as influences that may be preventing girls from taking an interest in CS. The study herein draws on a systematic review of 28 peer-reviewed articles published since 2006. The findings of the review point to the existence of the stereotypical image of a helpless, uninterested, and unhappy \"Girl in Computer Science\". It may be even more troubling a construct than that of the geeky, nerdy male counterpart, as it is rooted in the notion that women are technologically inept and ill-suited for CS careers. Thus, girls think they must be naturally hyper-intelligent in order to pursue studies in CS, as opposed to motivated, interested, and focused to succeed in those fields. Second, based on the review, suggestions for inclusive CS education were summarized. The authors argue that in order to make CS more inclusive for girls, cultural implications, as well as stereotypization in CS classrooms and CS education, need to be recognized as harmful. These stereotypes and cultural ideas should be eliminated by empowering female students through direct encouragement, mentoring programs, or girls-only initiatives."

The body is 185 km in diameter and has a relatively low V-band geometric albedo of ~8%. Although the colours of the object indicate that 2012 DR30 is an RI taxonomy class TNO or Centaur, we detected an absorption feature in the Z-band that is uncommon among these bodies. A dynamical analysis of the target's orbit shows that 2012 DR30 moves on a relatively unstable orbit and was most likely only recently placed on its current orbit from the most distant and still highly unexplored regions of the Solar System.

    "title": "MILAAP: Mobile Link Allocation via Attention-based Prediction",
    "summary": "Channel hopping (CS) communication systems must adapt to interference changes in the wireless network and to node mobility for maintaining throughput efficiency. Optimal scheduling requires up-to-date network state information (i.e., of channel occupancy) to select non-overlapping channels for links in interference regions. However, state sharing among nodes introduces significant communication overhead, especially as network size or node mobility scale, thereby decreasing throughput efficiency of already capacity-limited networks. In this paper, we eschew state sharing while adapting the CS schedule based on a learning-based channel occupancy prediction. We propose the MiLAAP attention-based prediction framework for machine learning models of spectral, spatial, and temporal dependencies among network nodes. MiLAAP uses a self-attention mechanism that lets each node capture the temporospectral CS pattern in its interference region and accordingly predict the channel occupancy state within that region. Notably, the prediction relies only on locally and passively observed channel activities, and thus introduces no communication overhead. To deal with node mobility, MiLAAP also uses a multi-head self-attention mechanism that lets each node locally capture the spatiotemporal dependencies on other network nodes that can interfere with it and accordingly predict the motion trajectory of those nodes. Detecting nodes that enter or move outside the interference region is used to further improve the prediction accuracy of channel occupancy. We show that for dynamic networks that use local CS sequences to support relatively long-lived flow traffics, the channel state prediction accuracy of MiLAAP is remarkably ~100% across different node mobility patterns and it achieves zero-shot generalizability across different periods of CS sequences."

However, its direct application to multilingual scenarios like code-switching, presents challenges. Although there is potential for performance improvement, a kNN-CTC model utilizing a single bilingual datastore can inadvertently introduce undesirable noise from the alternative language. To address this, we propose a novel kNN-CTC-based code-switching ASR (CS-ASR) framework that employs dual monolingual datastores and a gated datastore selection mechanism to reduce noise interference. Our method selects the appropriate datastore for decoding each frame, ensuring the injection of language-specific information into the ASR process. We apply this framework to cutting-edge CTC-based models, developing an advanced CS-ASR system. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our gated datastore mechanism in enhancing the performance of zero-shot Chinese-English CS-ASR."

    "title": "How are Primary School Computer Science Curricular Reforms Contributing to Equity? Impact on Student Learning, Perception of the Discipline, and Gender Gaps",
    "summary": "Early exposure to Computer Science (CS) for all is critical to broaden participation and promote equity in the field. But how does introducting CS into primary school curricula impact learning, perception, and gaps between groups of students? We investigate a CS-curricular reform and teacher Professional Development (PD) program from an equity standpoint by applying hierarchical regression and structural equation modelling on student learning and perception data from three studies with respectively 1384, 2433 & 1644 grade 3-6 students (ages 7-11) and their 83, 142 & 95 teachers. Regarding learning, exposure to CS instruction appears to contribute to closing the performance gap between low-achieving and high-achieving students, as well as pre-existing gender gaps. Despite a lack of direct influence of what was taught on student learning, there is no impact of teachers' demographics or motivation on student learning, with teachers' perception of the CS-PD positively influencing learning. Regarding perception, students perceive CS and its teaching tools (robotics, tablets) positively, and even more so when they perceive a role model close to them as doing CS. Nonetheless gender differences exist all around with boys perceiving CS more positively than girls despite access to CS education. However, access to CS-education affects boys and girls differently: larger gender gaps are closing (namely those related to robotics), while smaller gaps are increasing (namely those related to CS and tablets). To conclude, our findings highlight how a CS curricular reform impacts learning, perception, and equity and supports the importance of i) early introductions to CS for all, ii) preparing teachers to teach CS all the while removing the influence of teacher demographics and motivation on student outcomes, and iii) having developmentally appropriate activities that signal to all groups of students."

    "title": "Towards Fine-Grained Code-Switch Speech Translation with Semantic Space Alignment",
    "summary": "Code-switching (CS) speech translation (ST) refers to translating speech that alternates between two or more languages into a target language text, which poses significant challenges due to the complexity of semantic modeling and the scarcity of CS data. Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach."

    "title": "A Lightweight Recurrent Learning Network for Sustainable Compressed Sensing",
    "summary": "Recently, deep learning-based compressed sensing (CS) has achieved great success in reducing the sampling and computational cost of sensing systems and improving the reconstruction quality. These approaches, however, largely overlook the issue of the computational cost; they rely on complex structures and task-specific operator designs, resulting in extensive storage and high energy consumption in CS imaging systems. In this paper, we propose a lightweight but effective deep neural network based on recurrent learning to achieve a sustainable CS system; it requires a smaller number of parameters but obtains high-quality reconstructions. Specifically, our proposed network consists of an initial reconstruction sub-network and a residual reconstruction sub-network. While the initial reconstruction sub-network has a hierarchical structure to progressively recover the image, reducing the number of parameters, the residual reconstruction sub-network facilitates recurrent residual feature extraction via recurrent learning to perform both feature fusion and deep reconstructions across different scales. In addition, we also demonstrate that, after the initial reconstruction, feature maps with reduced sizes are sufficient to recover the residual information, and thus we achieved a significant reduction in the amount of memory required. Extensive experiments illustrate that our proposed model can achieve a better reconstruction quality than existing state-of-the-art CS algorithms, and it also has a smaller number of network parameters than these algorithms. Our source codes are available at: https://github.com/C66YU/CSRN."

In order to apply the CS techniques to wireless communication systems, there are a number of things to know and also several issues to be considered. However, it is not easy to come up with simple and easy answers to the issues raised while carrying out research on CS. The main purpose of this paper is to provide essential knowledge and useful tips that wireless communication researchers need to know when designing CS-based wireless systems. First, we present an overview of the CS technique, including basic setup, sparse recovery algorithm, and performance guarantee. Then, we describe three distinct subproblems of CS, viz., sparse estimation, support identification, and sparse detection, with various wireless communication applications. We also address main issues encountered in the design of CS-based wireless communication systems. These include potentials and limitations of CS techniques, useful tips that one should be aware of, subtle points that one should pay attention to, and some prior knowledge to achieve better performance. Our hope is that this article will be a useful guide for wireless communication researchers and even non-experts to grasp the gist of CS techniques."

    "title": "Performance Limits of Segmented Compressive Sampling: Correlated Samples versus Bits",
    "summary": "This paper gives performance limits of the segmented compressive sampling (CS) which collects correlated samples. It is shown that the effect of correlation among samples for the segmented CS can be characterized by a penalty term in the corresponding bounds on the sampling rate. Moreover, this penalty term is vanishing as the signal dimension increases. It means that the performance degradation due to the fixed correlation among samples obtained by the segmented CS (as compared to the standard CS with equivalent size sampling matrix) is negligible for a high-dimensional signal. In combination with the fact that the signal reconstruction quality improves with additional samples obtained by the segmented CS (as compared to the standard CS with sampling matrix of the size given by the number of original uncorrelated samples), the fact that the additional correlated samples also provide new information about a signal is a strong argument for the segmented CS."

    "summary": "Computer science (CS) is increasingly becoming part of the curricula of K-12 education in different countries. However, there are few K-12 CS teachers, and tools to offer K-12 CS education are often limited. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) might help to temporarily address these challenges, and enable more schools to offer CS education. The goal of this systematic review is to give an overview of how CS MOOCs have been used in K-12 education. Nineteen papers from 2014 to May 2024 were included, describing thirteen different MOOCs. This review summarizes the research performed with these MOOCs and discusses directions for future research. Our findings show that most CS MOOCs target only part of the CS curriculum. When using a MOOC, a classroom teacher has an important role in supporting and managing students as they work in the MOOC. Research evaluating MOOCs is diverse, both in aims and in methods. In conclusion, MOOCs can play a valuable role in K-12 CS education, although additional teacher training to support students might be required. Moreover, additional learning material is needed to cover the full curriculum, as most MOOCs focus on programming and computational thinking."

CS is a complex phenomenon that not only encompasses linguistic challenges, but also contains a great deal of complexity in terms of its dynamic behaviour across speakers. Given that the factors giving rise to CS vary from one country to the other, as well as from one person to the other, CS is found to be a speaker-dependant behaviour, where the frequency by which the foreign language is embedded differs across speakers. While several researchers have looked into predicting CS behaviour from a linguistic point of view, research is still lacking in the task of predicting user CS behaviour from sociological and psychological perspectives. We provide an empirical user study, where we investigate the correlations between users' CS levels and character traits. We conduct interviews with bilinguals and gather information on their profiles, including their demographics, personality traits, and traveling experiences. We then use machine learning (ML) to predict users' CS levels based on their profiles, where we identify the main influential factors in the modeling process. We experiment with both classification as well as regression tasks. Our results show that the CS behaviour is affected by the relation between speakers, travel experiences as well as Neuroticism and Extraversion personality traits."

    "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for privacy-enhancement and latency minimization in various real-world applications, such as transportation, communications, and healthcare. FL endeavors to bring Machine Learning (ML) down to the edge by harnessing data from million of devices and IoT sensors, thus enabling rapid responses to dynamic environments and yielding highly personalized results. However, the increased amount of sensors across diverse applications poses challenges in terms of communication and resource allocation, hindering the participation of all devices in the federated process and prompting the need for effective FL client selection. To address this issue, we propose Cellular Automaton-based Client Selection (CA-CS), a novel client selection algorithm, which leverages Cellular Automata (CA) as models to effectively capture spatio-temporal changes in a fast-evolving environment. CA-CS considers the computational resources and communication capacity of each participating client, while also accounting for inter-client interactions between neighbors during the client selection process, enabling intelligent client selection for online FL processes on data streams that closely resemble real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a thorough evaluation of the proposed CA-CS algorithm using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, while making a direct comparison against a uniformly random client selection scheme. Our results demonstrate that CA-CS achieves comparable accuracy to the random selection approach, while effectively avoiding high-latency clients."

    "summary": "When communicating with elders with cognitive impairment, cognitive stimulation (CS) help to maintain the cognitive health of elders. Data sparsity is the main challenge in building CS-based dialogue systems, particularly in the Chinese language. To fill this gap, we construct a Chinese CS conversation (CSConv) dataset, which contains about 2.6K groups of dialogues with CS principles and emotional support strategy labels. Making chit chat while providing emotional support is overlooked by the majority of existing cognitive dialogue systems. In this paper, we propose a multi-source knowledge fusion method for CS dialogue (CSD), to generate open-ended responses guided by the CS principle and emotional support strategy. We first use a progressive mask method based on external knowledge to learn encoders as effective classifiers, which is the prerequisite to predict the CS principle and emotional support strategy of the target response. Then a decoder interacts with the perceived CS principle and emotional support strategy to generate responses. Extensive experiments conducted on the CSConv dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, while there is still a large space for improvement compared to human performance."

    "summary": "In recent years, compressed sensing (CS) based image coding has become a hot topic in image processing field. However, since the bit depth required for encoding each CS sample is too large, the compression performance of this paradigm is unattractive. To address this issue, a novel CS-based image coding system by using gray transformation is proposed. In the proposed system, we use a gray transformation to preprocess the original image firstly and then use CS to sample the transformed image. Since gray transformation makes the probability distribution of CS samples centralized, the bit depth required for encoding each CS sample is reduced significantly. Consequently, the proposed system can considerably improve the compression performance of CS-based image coding. Simulation results show that the proposed system outperforms the traditional one without using gray transformation in terms of compression performance."

    "summary": "Cued Speech (CS) is a communication system for deaf people or hearing impaired people, in which a speaker uses it to aid a lipreader in phonetic level by clarifying potentially ambiguous mouth movements with hand shape and positions. Feature extraction of multi-modal CS is a key step in CS recognition. Recent supervised deep learning based methods suffer from noisy CS data annotations especially for hand shape modality. In this work, we first propose a self-supervised contrastive learning method to learn the feature representation of image without using labels. Secondly, a small amount of manually annotated CS data are used to fine-tune the first module. Thirdly, we present a module, which combines Bi-LSTM and self-attention networks to further learn sequential features with temporal and contextual information. Besides, to enlarge the volume and the diversity of the current limited CS datasets, we build a new British English dataset containing 5 native CS speakers. Evaluation results on both French and British English datasets show that our model achieves over 90% accuracy in hand shape recognition. Significant improvements of 8.75% (for French) and 10.09% (for British English) are achieved in CS phoneme recognition correctness compared with the state-of-the-art."

    "summary": "Cued Speech (CS) is an advanced visual phonetic encoding system that integrates lip reading with hand codings, enabling people with hearing impairments to communicate efficiently. CS video generation aims to produce specific lip and gesture movements of CS from audio or text inputs. The main challenge is that given limited CS data, we strive to simultaneously generate fine-grained hand and finger movements, as well as lip movements, meanwhile the two kinds of movements need to be asynchronously aligned. Existing CS generation methods are fragile and prone to poor performance due to template-based statistical models and careful hand-crafted pre-processing to fit the models. Therefore, we propose a novel Gloss-prompted Diffusion-based CS Gesture generation framework (called GlossDiff). Specifically, to integrate additional linguistic rules knowledge into the model. we first introduce a bridging instruction called Gloss , which is an automatically generated descriptive text to establish a direct and more delicate semantic connection between spoken language and CS gestures. Moreover, we first suggest rhythm is an important paralinguistic feature for CS to improve the communication efficacy. Therefore, we propose a novel Audio-driven Rhythmic Module (ARM) to learn rhythm that matches audio speech. Moreover, in this work, we design, record, and publish the first Chinese CS dataset with four CS cuers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We release the code and data at https://glossdiff.github.io/."

In this paper we explore multiple strategies of applying state of the art POS taggers to CS data. We investigate the landscape in two CS language pairs, Spanish-English and Modern Standard Arabic-Arabic dialects. We compare the use of two POS taggers vs. a unified tagger trained on CS data. Our results show that applying a machine learning framework using two state of the art POS taggers achieves better performance compared to all other approaches that we investigate."

Reliability of the solution is determined by the uniqueness condition. With its mathematically tractable and feasible calculation, coherence index is one of very few CS metrics with a considerable practical importance. In this paper, we propose an improvement of the coherence based uniqueness relation for the matching pursuit algorithms. Starting from a simple and intuitive derivation of the standard uniqueness condition based on the coherence index, we derive a less conservative coherence index-based lower bound for signal sparsity. The results are generalized to the uniqueness condition of the -norm minimization for a signal represented in two orthonormal bases."

In this paper we address the application of CS to the scenario of progressive acquisition of 2D visual signals in a line-by-line fashion. This is an important setting which encompasses diverse systems such as flatbed scanners and remote sensing imagers. The use of CS in such setting raises the problem of reconstructing a very high number of samples, as are contained in an image, from their linear projections. Conventional reconstruction algorithms, whose complexity is cubic in the number of samples, are computationally intractable. In this paper we develop an iterative reconstruction algorithm that reconstructs an image by iteratively estimating a row, and correlating adjacent rows by means of linear prediction. We develop suitable predictors and test the proposed algorithm in the context of flatbed scanners and remote sensing imaging systems. We show that this approach can significantly improve the results of separate reconstruction of each row, providing very good reconstruction quality with reasonable complexity."

Enrollment declined to 13% in 2023-2024, though the cause and persistence of this trend remains unknown. Additional analyses differentiate foundational and advanced CS courses as well as examine participation by sex and race, offering additional insight. As CS, artificial intelligence, and related fields become more important across our society, they also become a key component of a robust K-12 education.

    "title": "Compressive Sensing of Sparse Tensors",
    "summary": "Compressive sensing (CS) has triggered enormous research activity since its first appearance. CS exploits the signal's sparsity or compressibility in a particular domain and integrates data compression and acquisition, thus allowing exact reconstruction through relatively few non-adaptive linear measurements. While conventional CS theory relies on data representation in the form of vectors, many data types in various applications such as color imaging, video sequences, and multi-sensor networks, are intrinsically represented by higher-order tensors. Application of CS to higher-order data representation is typically performed by conversion of the data to very long vectors that must be measured using very large sampling matrices, thus imposing a huge computational and memory burden. In this paper, we propose Generalized Tensor Compressive Sensing (GTCS)--a unified framework for compressive sensing of higher-order tensors which preserves the intrinsic structure of tensor data with reduced computational complexity at reconstruction. GTCS offers an efficient means for representation of multidimensional data by providing simultaneous acquisition and compression from all tensor modes. In addition, we propound two reconstruction procedures, a serial method (GTCS-S) and a parallelizable method (GTCS-P). We then compare the performance of the proposed method with Kronecker compressive sensing (KCS) and multi way compressive sensing (MWCS). We demonstrate experimentally that GTCS outperforms KCS and MWCS in terms of both reconstruction accuracy (within a range of compression ratios) and processing speed. The major disadvantage of our methods (and of MWCS as well), is that the compression ratios may be worse than that offered by KCS."

Numerical and visualization results show that the proposed approaches remarkably improve the performance of CS language models trained on monolingual data.

Part of the problem is to get a robot to emulate the perception of human beings, our sense of sight, replacing the eyes with cameras and the brain with mathematical models such as Neural Networks. Developing an AI able to drive a car without human intervention and a small robot to deliver packages in the city may seem like different problems, nevertheless from the point of view of perception and vision, both problems have several similarities. The main solutions we currently find focus on the environment perception through visual information using Computer Vision techniques, Machine Learning, and various algorithms to make the robot understand the environment or scene, move, adapt its trajectory and perform its tasks (maintenance, exploration, etc.) without the need for human intervention. In this work, we develop a small-scale autonomous vehicle from scratch, capable of understanding the scene using only visual information, navigating through industrial environments, detecting people and obstacles, or performing simple maintenance tasks. We review the state-of-the-art of fundamental problems and demonstrate that many methods employed at small-scale are similar to the ones employed in real Self-driving cars from companies like Tesla or Lyft.

    "summary": "Automatic Cued Speech Recognition (ACSR) provides an intelligent human-machine interface for visual communications, where the Cued Speech (CS) system utilizes lip movements and hand gestures to code spoken language for hearing-impaired people. Previous ACSR approaches often utilize direct feature concatenation as the main fusion paradigm. However, the asynchronous modalities i.e., lip, hand shape and hand position) in CS may cause interference for feature concatenation. To address this challenge, we propose a transformer based cross-modal mutual learning framework to prompt multi-modal interaction. Compared with the vanilla self-attention, our model forces modality-specific information of different modalities to pass through a modality-invariant codebook, collating linguistic representations for tokens of each modality. Then the shared linguistic knowledge is used to re-synchronize multi-modal sequences. Moreover, we establish a novel large-scale multi-speaker CS dataset for Mandarin Chinese. To our knowledge, this is the first work on ACSR for Mandarin Chinese. Extensive experiments are conducted for different languages i.e., Chinese, French, and British English). Results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior recognition performance to the state-of-the-art by a large margin."

Two important features of OtA computation, namely linear processing and signal-level superposition, motivate the use of linear compression with compressed sensing (CS) methods to reduce the number of data samples transmitted over the channel. The previous works on applying CS methods in OtA FL have primarily assumed that the original model update vectors are sparse, or they have been sparsified before compression. However, it is unclear whether linear compression with CS-based reconstruction is more effective than directly sending the non-zero elements in the sparsified update vectors, under the same total power constraint. In this study, we examine and compare several communication designs with or without sparsification. Our findings demonstrate that sparsification before compression is not necessary. Alternatively, sparsification without linear compression can also achieve better performance than the commonly considered setup that combines both."

    "summary": "Extreme debris discs are characterized by unusually strong mid-infrared excess emission, which often proves to be variable. The warm dust in these discs is of transient nature and is likely related to a recent giant collision occurring close to the star in the terrestrial region. Here we present the results of a 877 days long, gap-free photometric monitoring performed by the Spitzer Space Telescope of the recently discovered extreme debris disc around TYC 4209-1322-1. By combining these observations with other time-domain optical and mid-infrared data, we explore the disc variability of the last four decades with particular emphasis on the last 12 yr. During the latter interval the disc showed substantial changes, the most significant was the brightening and subsequent fading between 2014 and 2018 as outlined in WISE data. The Spitzer light curves outline the fading phase and a subsequent new brightening of the disc after 2018, revealing an additional flux modulation with a period of ~39 days on top of the long-term trend. We found that all these variations can be interpreted as the outcome of a giant collision that happened at an orbital radius of ~0.3 au sometime in 2014. Our analysis implies that a collision on a similar scale could have taken place around 2010, too. The fact that the disc was already peculiarly dust rich 40 yr ago, as implied by IRAS data, suggests that these dust production events belong to a chain of large impacts triggered by an earlier even more catastrophic collision."

    "summary": "When does a digital image resemble reality? The relevance of this question increases as the generation of synthetic images -- so called deep fakes -- becomes increasingly popular. Deep fakes have gained much attention for a number of reasons -- among others, due to their potential to disrupt the political climate. In order to mitigate these threats, the EU AI Act implements specific transparency regulations for generating synthetic content or manipulating existing content. However, the distinction between real and synthetic images is -- even from a computer vision perspective -- far from trivial. We argue that the current definition of deep fakes in the AI act and the corresponding obligations are not sufficiently specified to tackle the challenges posed by deep fakes. By analyzing the life cycle of a digital photo from the camera sensor to the digital editing features, we find that: (1.) Deep fakes are ill-defined in the EU AI Act. The definition leaves too much scope for what a deep fake is. (2.) It is unclear how editing functions like Google's ``best take'' feature can be considered as an exception to transparency obligations. (3.) The exception for substantially edited images raises questions about what constitutes substantial editing of content and whether or not this editing must be perceptible by a natural person. Our results demonstrate that complying with the current AI Act transparency obligations is difficult for providers and deployers. As a consequence of the unclear provisions, there is a risk that exceptions may be either too broad or too limited. We intend our analysis to foster the discussion on what constitutes a deep fake and to raise awareness about the pitfalls in the current AI Act transparency obligations."

In this approach, we utilize the rightmost k-LSB of pixels in an image to embed MP3 sound bits into a pixel. The pixels are so chosen that the distortion in image would be minimized due to embedding. This requires comparing all the possible permutations of pixel values, which may would lead to exponential time computation. To speed up this, Cuckoo Search (CS) could be used to find the most optimal solution. The advantage of using proposed CS is that it is easy to implement and is very effective at converging in relatively less iterations/generations."

    "title": "Performance Limits for Noisy Multi-Measurement Vector Problems",
    "summary": "Compressed sensing (CS) demonstrates that sparse signals can be estimated from under-determined linear systems. Distributed CS (DCS) further reduces the number of measurements by considering joint sparsity within signal ensembles. DCS with jointly sparse signals has applications in multi-sensor acoustic sensing, magnetic resonance imaging with multiple coils, remote sensing, and array signal processing. Multi-measurement vector (MMV) problems consider the estimation of jointly sparse signals under the DCS framework. Two related MMV settings are studied. In the first setting, each signal vector is measured by a different independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) measurement matrix, while in the second setting, all signal vectors are measured by the same i.i.d. matrix. Replica analysis is performed for these two MMV settings, and the minimum mean squared error (MMSE), which turns out to be identical for both settings, is obtained as a function of the noise variance and number of measurements. To showcase the application of MMV models, the MMSE's of complex CS problems with both real and complex measurement matrices are also analyzed. Multiple performance regions for MMV are identified where the MMSE behaves differently as a function of the noise variance and the number of measurements. Belief propagation (BP) is a CS signal estimation framework that often achieves the MMSE asymptotically. A phase transition for BP is identified. This phase transition, verified by numerical results, separates the regions where BP achieves the MMSE and where it is suboptimal. Numerical results also illustrate that more signal vectors in the jointly sparse signal ensemble lead to a better phase transition."

    "summary": "The process of visually presenting networks is an effective way to understand entity relationships within the networks since it reveals the overall structure and topology of the network. Real networks are extremely difficult to visualize due to their immense complexity, which includes vast amounts of data, several types of interactions, various subsystems and several levels of connectivity as well as changes over time. This paper introduces the \"MultiViz Plugin,\" a plugin for gephi, an open-source software tool for graph visualization and modification, in order to to visualize complex networks in a multi-layer manner. A collection of settings are availabe through the plugin to transform an existing network into a multi-layered network. The plugin supports several layout algorithms and lets user to choose which property of the network to be used as the layer. The goal of the study is to give the user complete control over how the network is visualized in a multi-layer fashion. We demonstrate the ability of the plugin to visualize multi-layer data using a real-life complex multi-layer datasets."

    "title": "Towards Symbolic Reinforcement Learning with Common Sense",
    "summary": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (deep RL) has made several breakthroughs in recent years in applications ranging from complex control tasks in unmanned vehicles to game playing. Despite their success, deep RL still lacks several important capacities of human intelligence, such as transfer learning, abstraction and interpretability. Deep Symbolic Reinforcement Learning (DSRL) seeks to incorporate such capacities to deep Q-networks (DQN) by learning a relevant symbolic representation prior to using Q-learning. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of DSRL, which we call Symbolic Reinforcement Learning with Common Sense (SRL+CS), offering a better balance between generalization and specialization, inspired by principles of common sense when assigning rewards and aggregating Q-values. Experiments reported in this paper show that SRL+CS learns consistently faster than Q-learning and DSRL, achieving also a higher accuracy. In the hardest case, where agents were trained in a deterministic environment and tested in a random environment, SRL+CS achieves nearly 100% average accuracy compared to DSRL's 70% and DQN's 50% accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of near perfect zero-shot transfer learning using Reinforcement Learning."

    "title": "Variational Bayesian algorithm for quantized compressed sensing",
    "summary": "Compressed sensing (CS) is on recovery of high dimensional signals from their low dimensional linear measurements under a sparsity prior and digital quantization of the measurement data is inevitable in practical implementation of CS algorithms. In the existing literature, the quantization error is modeled typically as additive noise and the multi-bit and 1-bit quantized CS problems are dealt with separately using different treatments and procedures. In this paper, a novel variational Bayesian inference based CS algorithm is presented, which unifies the multi- and 1-bit CS processing and is applicable to various cases of noiseless/noisy environment and unsaturated/saturated quantizer. By decoupling the quantization error from the measurement noise, the quantization error is modeled as a random variable and estimated jointly with the signal being recovered. Such a novel characterization of the quantization error results in superior performance of the algorithm which is demonstrated by extensive simulations in comparison with state-of-the-art methods for both multi-bit and 1-bit CS problems."

    "summary": "This paper addresses the real-time encoding-decoding problem for high-frame-rate video compressive sensing (CS). Unlike prior works that perform reconstruction using iterative optimization-based approaches, we propose a non-iterative model, named \"CSVideoNet\". CSVideoNet directly learns the inverse mapping of CS and reconstructs the original input in a single forward propagation. To overcome the limitations of existing CS cameras, we propose a multi-rate CNN and a synthesizing RNN to improve the trade-off between compression ratio (CR) and spatial-temporal resolution of the reconstructed videos. The experiment results demonstrate that CSVideoNet significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. With no pre/post-processing, we achieve 25dB PSNR recovery quality at 100x CR, with a frame rate of 125 fps on a Titan X GPU. Due to the feedforward and high-data-concurrency natures of CSVideoNet, it can take advantage of GPU acceleration to achieve three orders of magnitude speed-up over conventional iterative-based approaches. We share the source code at https://github.com/PSCLab-ASU/CSVideoNet."

    "summary": "Context: The retraction of research papers, for whatever reason, is a growing phenomenon. However, although retracted paper information is publicly available via publishers, it is somewhat distributed and inconsistent. Objective: The aim is to assess: (i) the extent and nature of retracted research in Computer Science (CS) (ii) the post-retraction citation behaviour of retracted works and (iii) the potential impact on systematic reviews and mapping studies. Method: We analyse the Retraction Watch database and take citation information from the Web of Science and Google scholar. Results: We find that of the 33,955 entries in the Retraction watch database (16 May 2022), 2,816 are classified as CS, i.e., approximately 8.3%. For CS, 56% of retracted papers, provide little or no information as to the reasons. This contrasts with 26% for other disciplines. There is also a remarkable disparity between different publishers, a tendency for multiple versions of a retracted paper over and above the Version of Record (VoR), and for new citations long after a paper is officially retracted. Conclusions: Unfortunately retraction seems to be a sufficiently common outcome for a scientific paper that we as a research community need to take it more seriously, e.g., standardising procedures and taxonomies across publishers and the provision of appropriate research tools. Finally, we recommend particular caution when undertaking secondary analyses and meta-analyses which are at risk of becoming contaminated by these problem primary studies."

At the same time, most CS departments across the country are only seeing 25 to 30 percent of female students in their classes, meaning that we are failing to draw interest from a large portion of the population. In this work, we explore the gender gap in CS at a large public research university, using three data sets that span thousands of students across 5 and a half academic years. By combining these data sets, we can explore many issues such as retention as students progress through the CS major. For example, we find that a large percentage of women taking the Introductory CS1 course for majors do not intend to major in CS, which contributes to a large increase in the gender gap immediately after CS1. This finding implies that a large part of the retention task is attracting these women to further explore the major. We report findings in three areas of research in the context of the CS department at our university: the CS environment, the computing background of our students, and the students' grades. These findings may also be applicable to computing programs at other large public research universities."

However, existing computational approaches and instruction-tuned LLMs fail to capture such nuanced property-specific objectives, limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we introduce C-MuMOInstruct, the first instruction-tuning dataset focused on multi-property optimization with explicit, property-specific objectives. Leveraging C-MuMOInstruct, we develop GeLLMO-Cs, a series of instruction-tuned LLMs that can perform targeted property-specific optimization. Our experiments across 5 in-distribution and 5 out-of-distribution tasks show that GeLLMO-Cs consistently outperform strong baselines, achieving up to 126% higher success rate. Notably, GeLLMO-Cs exhibit impressive 0-shot generalization to novel optimization tasks and unseen instructions. This offers a step toward a foundational LLM to support realistic, diverse optimizations with property-specific objectives.

The difficulties of CS speech recognition lie in alternating languages and the lack of transcribed data. Therefore, this paper uses the recently successful self-supervised learning (SSL) methods to leverage many unlabeled speech data without CS. We show that hidden representations of SSL models offer frame-level language identity even if the models are trained with English speech only. Jointly training CTC and language identification modules with self-supervised speech representations improves CS speech recognition performance. Furthermore, using multilingual speech data for pre-training obtains the best CS speech recognition."

In addition, state-of-the-art compressed sensing (CS) analytics are not cognizant of the image diagnostic quality . To cope with these challenges we put forth a novel CS framework that permeates benefits from generative adversarial networks (GAN) to train a (low-dimensional) manifold of diagnostic-quality MR images from historical patients. Leveraging a mixture of least-squares (LS) GANs and pixel-wise cost, a deep residual network with skip connections is trained as the generator that learns to remove the aliasing artifacts by projecting onto the manifold. LSGAN learns the texture details, while controls the high-frequency noise. A multilayer convolutional neural network is then jointly trained based on diagnostic quality images to discriminate the projection quality. The test phase performs feed-forward propagation over the generator network that demands a very low computational overhead. Extensive evaluations are performed on a large contrast-enhanced MR dataset of pediatric patients. In particular, images rated based on expert radiologists corroborate that GANCS retrieves high contrast images with detailed texture relative to conventional CS, and pixel-wise schemes. In addition, it offers reconstruction under a few milliseconds, two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art CS-MRI schemes."

This paper studies CS-SVM when the data points are uncertain or mislabelled. With some properties known for the distributions, a chance-constrained CS-SVM approach is used to ensure the small probability of misclassification for the uncertain data. The geometric interpretation is presented to show how CS-SVM works. Finally, we present experimental results to investigate the chance constrained CS-SVM's performance."

The results show that the positive outcomes of the workshop underscore the effectiveness of a game-based collaborative learning approach to get girls interested in computer science activities. The variety of solutions found for the different tasks demonstrates the creativity and problem-solving skills of the participants and underlines the effectiveness of the workshop in promoting critical thinking and computational skills."

We develop an experimental programming language based on the polymorphic RPC calculus. We introduce a polymorphic Client-Server (CS) calculus with the client and server parts separated.

In OA-FMTL, the local updates of edge devices are sparsified, compressed, and then sent over the uplink channel in a superimposed fashion. The ES employs over-the-air computation in the presence of intertask interference. More specifically, the model aggregations of all the tasks are reconstructed from the channel observations concurrently, based on a modified version of the turbo compressed sensing (Turbo-CS) algorithm (named as M-Turbo-CS). We analyze the performance of the proposed OA-FMTL framework together with the M-Turbo-CS algorithm. Furthermore, based on the analysis, we formulate a communication-learning optimization problem to improve the system performance by adjusting the power allocation among the tasks at the edge devices. Numerical simulations show that our proposed OAFMTL effectively suppresses the inter-task interference, and achieves a learning performance comparable to its counterpart with orthogonal multi-task transmission. It is also shown that the proposed inter-task power allocation optimization algorithm substantially reduces the overall communication overhead by appropriately adjusting the power allocation among the tasks."

    "title": "Statistical Compressed Sensing of Gaussian Mixture Models",
    "summary": "A novel framework of compressed sensing, namely statistical compressed sensing (SCS), that aims at efficiently sampling a collection of signals that follow a statistical distribution, and achieving accurate reconstruction on average, is introduced. SCS based on Gaussian models is investigated in depth. For signals that follow a single Gaussian model, with Gaussian or Bernoulli sensing matrices of O(k) measurements, considerably smaller than the O(k log(N/k)) required by conventional CS based on sparse models, where N is the signal dimension, and with an optimal decoder implemented via linear filtering, significantly faster than the pursuit decoders applied in conventional CS, the error of SCS is shown tightly upper bounded by a constant times the best k-term approximation error, with overwhelming probability. The failure probability is also significantly smaller than that of conventional sparsity-oriented CS. Stronger yet simpler results further show that for any sensing matrix, the error of Gaussian SCS is upper bounded by a constant times the best k-term approximation with probability one, and the bound constant can be efficiently calculated. For Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), that assume multiple Gaussian distributions and that each signal follows one of them with an unknown index, a piecewise linear estimator is introduced to decode SCS. The accuracy of model selection, at the heart of the piecewise linear decoder, is analyzed in terms of the properties of the Gaussian distributions and the number of sensing measurements. A maximum a posteriori expectation-maximization algorithm that iteratively estimates the Gaussian models parameters, the signals model selection, and decodes the signals, is presented for GMM-based SCS. In real image sensing applications, GMM-based SCS is shown to lead to improved results compared to conventional CS, at a considerably lower computational cost."

For this reason, we propose a novel progressive CS architecture based on separate sensing of spectral rows and joint reconstruction employing Total Variation. Experimental results run on raw AVIRIS and AIRS images confirm the validity of the proposed system."

Specifically, our synthesizer generates mp-MRI data in a sequential manner: first generating ADC maps from 128-d latent vectors, followed by translating them to the T2w images. The synthesizer is trained in a semisupervised manner. In the supervised training process, a limited amount of paired ADC-T2w images and the corresponding ADC encodings are provided and the synthesizer learns the paired relationship by explicitly minimizing the reconstruction losses between synthetic and real images. To avoid overfitting limited ADC encodings, an unlimited amount of random latent vectors and unpaired ADC-T2w Images are utilized in the unsupervised training process for learning the marginal image distributions of real images. To improve the robustness of synthesizing, we decompose the difficult task of generating full-size images into several simpler tasks which generate sub-images only. A StitchLayer is then employed to fuse sub-images together in an interlaced manner into a full-size image. To enforce the synthetic images to indeed contain distinguishable CS PCa lesions, we propose to also maximize an auxiliary distance of Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between CS and nonCS images. Experimental results show that our method can effectively synthesize a large variety of mpMRI images which contain meaningful CS PCa lesions, display a good visual quality and have the correct paired relationship. Compared to the state-of-the-art synthesis methods, our method achieves a significant improvement in terms of both visual and quantitative evaluation metrics."

Due to the high dimensionality of images, previous CS methods mainly work on image blocks to avoid the huge requirements of memory and computation, i.e., image blocks are measured with Gaussian random matrices, and the whole images are recovered from the reconstructed image blocks. Though efficient, such methods suffer from serious blocking artifacts. In this paper, we propose a convolutional CS framework that senses the whole image using a set of convolutional filters. Instead of reconstructing individual blocks, the whole image is reconstructed from the linear convolutional measurements. Specifically, the convolutional CS is implemented based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), which performs both the convolutional CS and nonlinear reconstruction. Through end-to-end training, the sensing filters and the reconstruction network can be jointly optimized. To facilitate the design of the CS reconstruction network, a novel two-branch CNN inspired from a sparsity-based CS reconstruction model is developed. Experimental results show that the proposed method substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art CS methods in term of both PSNR and visual quality."

We then establish bounds on the number of measurements required by these problems to successfully reconstruct the original signal. Our bounds and geometrical interpretations reveal that if the prior information has good enough quality, L1-L1 minimization improves the performance of CS dramatically. In contrast, L1-L2 minimization has a performance very similar to classical CS and brings no significant benefits. All our findings are illustrated with experimental results."

Existing methods do not have wide language coverage, fail to account for the diverse range of CS phenomena, or do not scale. We propose an intervention based on minimal pairs of CS. Each minimal pair contains one naturally occurring CS sentence and one minimally manipulated variant. We collect up to 1,000 such pairs each for 11 language pairs. Our human experiments show that, for every language pair, bilinguals consistently prefer the naturally occurring CS sentence. Meanwhile our experiments with current LLMs show that the larger the model, the more consistently it assigns higher probability to the naturally occurring CS sentence than to the variant. In accordance with theoretical claims, the largest probability differences arise in those pairs where the manipulated material consisted of closed-class words."

Given any query nodes, CS aims to find cohesive subgraphs that query nodes belong to. Recently, a large number of CS algorithms are designed. These algorithms adopt predefined subgraph patterns to model the communities, which cannot find ground-truth communities that do not have such pre-defined patterns in real-world graphs. Thereby, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based approaches are proposed to capture flexible community structures by learning from ground-truth communities in a data-driven fashion. These approaches rely on sufficient training data to provide enough generalization for ML models, however, the ground-truth cannot be comprehensively collected beforehand. In this paper, we study ML/DL-based approaches for CS, under the circumstance of small training data. Instead of directly fitting the small data, we extract prior knowledge which is shared across multiple CS tasks via learning a meta model. Each CS task is a graph with several queries that possess corresponding partial ground-truth. The meta model can be swiftly adapted to a task to be predicted by feeding a few task-specific training data. We find that trivially applying multiple classical metalearning algorithms to CS suffers from problems regarding prediction effectiveness, generalization capability and efficiency. To address such problems, we propose a novel meta-learning based framework, Conditional Graph Neural Process (CGNP), to fulfill the prior extraction and adaptation procedure. A meta CGNP model is a task-common node embedding function for clustering, learned by metric-based graph learning, which fully exploits the characteristics of CS. We compare CGNP with CS algorithms and ML baselines on real graphs with ground-truth communities."

    "summary": "Code-switching (CS) is a widespread phenomenon among bilingual and multilingual societies. The lack of CS resources hinders the performance of many NLP tasks. In this work, we explore the potential use of bilingual word embeddings for code-switching (CS) language modeling (LM) in the low resource Egyptian Arabic-English language. We evaluate different state-of-the-art bilingual word embeddings approaches that require cross-lingual resources at different levels and propose an innovative but simple approach that jointly learns bilingual word representations without the use of any parallel data, relying only on monolingual and a small amount of CS data. While all representations improve CS LM, ours performs the best and improves perplexity 33.5% relative over the baseline."

    "title": "Better Balance in Informatics: An Honest Discussion with Students",
    "summary": "In recent years, there has been considerable effort to promote gender balance in the academic environment of Computer Science (CS). However, there is still a gender gap at all CS academic levels: from students, to PhD candidates, to faculty members. This general trend is followed by the Department of Computer Science at UiT The Arctic University of Norway. To combat this trend within the CS environment at UiT, we embarked on structured discussions with students of our department. After analyzing the data collected from these discussions, we were able to identify action items that could mitigate the existing gender gap at our department. In particular, these discussions elucidated ways to achieve (i) a balanced flow of students into CS undergraduate program, (ii) a balanced CS study environment, and (iii) a balanced flow of graduates into higher levels of the CS academia (e.g., PhD program). This paper presents the results of the discussions and the subsequent recommendations that we made to the administration of the department. We also provide a road-map that other institutions could follow to organize similar events as part of their gender-balance action plan."

    "summary": "This article investigates synthetic model-predictive control (MPC) problems to demonstrate that an increased precision of the internal prediction model (PM) automatially entails an improvement of the controller as a whole. In contrast to reinforcement learning (RL), MPC uses the PM to predict subsequent states of the controlled system (CS), instead of directly recommending suitable actions. To assess how the precision of the PM translates into the quality of the model-predictive controller, we compare a DNN-based PM to the optimal baseline PM for three well-known control problems of varying complexity. The baseline PM achieves perfect accuracy by accessing the simulation of the CS itself. Based on the obtained results, we argue that an improvement of the PM will always improve the controller as a whole, without considering the impact of other components such as action selection (which, in this article, relies on evolutionary optimization)."

We proposed a solution called Kalman Filtered Compressed Sensing (KF-CS). The key idea is to run a reduced order KF only for the current signal's estimated nonzero coefficients' set, while performing CS on the Kalman filtering error to estimate new additions, if any, to the set. KF may be replaced by Least Squares (LS) estimation and we call the resulting algorithm LS-CS. In this work, (a) we bound the error in performing CS on the LS error and (b) we obtain the conditions under which the KF-CS (or LS-CS) estimate converges to that of a genie-aided KF (or LS), i.e. the KF (or LS) which knows the true nonzero sets."

To derive the construction, we use Boolean functions to represent a polynomial generated with a recursion. By applying this representation to recursive CS constructions, we show the impact of construction parameters such as sign, amplitude, phase rotation used in the recursion on the elements of the synthesized CS. As a result, we extend Davis and Jedwab's CS construction by obtaining independent functions for the amplitude and phase of each element of the CS, and the seed sequence positions in the CS. The proposed construction shows that a set of distinct CSs compatible with non-contiguous resource allocations for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and various constellations can be synthesized systematically. It also leads to a low peak-to-mean-envelope-power ratio (PMEPR) multiple accessing scheme in the uplink and a low-complexity recursive decoder. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed encoder and decoder through comprehensive simulations."

Current diagnosis of CS relies on labor and cost intensive neuroimaging techniques, unsuitable for areas with inadequate access to quality medical facilities. Thus, there is a great need for an efficient diagnosis alternative. StrokeSave is a platform for users to self-diagnose for prevalence to stroke. The mobile app is continuously updated with heart rate, blood pressure, and blood oxygen data from sensors on the patient wrist. Once these measurements reach a threshold for possible stroke, the patient takes facial images and vocal recordings to screen for paralysis attributed to stroke. A custom designed lens attached to a phone's camera then takes retinal images for the deep learning model to classify based on presence of retinopathy and sends a comprehensive diagnosis. The deep learning model, which consists of a RNN trained on 100 voice slurred audio files, a SVM trained on 410 vascular data points, and a CNN trained on 520 retinopathy images, achieved a holistic accuracy of 95.0 percent when validated on 327 samples. This value exceeds that of clinical examination accuracy, which is around 40 to 89 percent, further demonstrating the vital utility of such a medical device. Through this automated platform, users receive efficient, highly accurate diagnosis without professional medical assistance, revolutionizing medical diagnosis of CS and potentially saving millions of lives."

In this paper, we introduce JMMMU (Japanese MMMU), the first large-scale Japanese benchmark designed to evaluate LMMs on expert-level tasks based on the Japanese cultural context. To facilitate comprehensive culture-aware evaluation, JMMMU features two complementary subsets: (i) culture-agnostic (CA) subset, where the culture-independent subjects (e.g., Math) are selected and translated into Japanese, enabling one-to-one comparison with its English counterpart MMMU; and (ii) culture-specific (CS) subset, comprising newly crafted subjects that reflect Japanese cultural context. Using the CA subset, we observe performance drop in many LMMs when evaluated in Japanese, which is purely attributable to language variation. Using the CS subset, we reveal their inadequate Japanese cultural understanding. Further, by combining both subsets, we identify that some LMMs perform well on the CA subset but not on the CS subset, exposing a shallow understanding of the Japanese language that lacks depth in cultural understanding. We hope this work will not only help advance LMM performance in Japanese but also serve as a guideline to create high-standard, culturally diverse benchmarks for multilingual LMM development.

Processing CS data is especially challenging in intra-sentential data given state-of-the-art monolingual NLP technologies since such technologies are geared toward the processing of one language at a time. In this paper, we address the problem of Part-of-Speech tagging (POS) in the context of linguistic code switching (CS). We explore leveraging multiple neural network architectures to measure the impact of different pre-trained embeddings methods on POS tagging CS data. We investigate the landscape in four CS language pairs, Spanish-English, Hindi-English, Modern Standard Arabic- Egyptian Arabic dialect (MSA-EGY), and Modern Standard Arabic- Levantine Arabic dialect (MSA-LEV). Our results show that multilingual embedding (e.g., MSA-EGY and MSA-LEV) helps closely related languages (EGY/LEV) but adds noise to the languages that are distant (SPA/HIN). Finally, we show that our proposed models outperform state-of-the-art CS taggers for MSA-EGY language pair."

    "title": "Compressed Sensing SAR Imaging with Multilook Processing",
    "summary": "Multilook processing is a widely used speckle reduction approach in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging. Conventionally, it is achieved by incoherently summing of some independent low-resolution images formulated from overlapping subbands of the SAR signal. However, in the context of compressive sensing (CS) SAR imaging, where the samples are collected at sub-Nyquist rate, the data spectrum is highly aliased that hinders the direct application of the existing multilook techniques. In this letter, we propose a new CS-SAR imaging method that can realize multilook processing simultaneously during image reconstruction. The main idea is to replace the SAR observation matrix by the inverse of multilook procedures, which is then combined with random sampling matrix to yield a multilook CS-SAR observation model. Then a joint sparse regularization model, considering pixel dependency of subimages, is derived to form multilook images. The suggested SAR imaging method can not only reconstruct sparse scene efficiently below Nyquist rate, but is also able to achieve a comparable reduction of speckles during reconstruction. Simulation results are finally provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

For this purpose, the optimal design of encoder-decoder pair of a VQ is considered, where the optimality is addressed by minimizing end-to-end mean square error (MSE). We derive a theoretical lower-bound on the MSE performance, and propose a practical encoder-decoder design through an iterative algorithm. The resulting coding scheme is referred to as channel- optimized VQ for CS, coined COVQ-CS. In order to address the encoding complexity issue of the COVQ-CS, we propose to use a structured quantizer, namely low complexity multi-stage VQ (MSVQ). We derive new encoding and decoding conditions for the MSVQ, and then propose a practical encoder-decoder design algorithm referred to as channel-optimized MSVQ for CS, coined COMSVQ-CS.

    "summary": "Distributed algorithms for network science applications are of great importance due to today's large real-world networks. In such algorithms, a node is allowed only to have local interactions with its immediate neighbors. This is because the whole network topological structure is often unknown to each node. Recently, distributed detection of central nodes, concerning different notions of importance, within a network has received much attention. Closeness centrality is a prominent measure to evaluate the importance (influence) of nodes, based on their accessibility, in a given network. In this paper, first, we introduce a local (ego-centric) metric that correlates well with the global closeness centrality; however, it has very low computational complexity. Second, we propose a compressive sensing (CS)-based framework to accurately recover high closeness centrality nodes in the network utilizing the proposed local metric. Both ego-centric metric computation and its aggregation via CS are efficient and distributed, using only local interactions between neighboring nodes. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method through extensive experiments on various synthetic and real-world networks. The results show that the proposed local metric correlates with the global closeness centrality, better than the current local metrics. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the proposed CS-based method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with notable improvement."

Objective: We introduce the CS Interests and Beliefs Inventory (CSIBI), an instrument designed for novice secondary students learning by designing projects (particularly with physical computing). The inventory contains subscales on beliefs on problem solving competency, fascination in design, value of CS, creative expression, and beliefs about context-specific CS abilities alongside programming mindsets and outcomes. We explain the creation of the instrument and attend to the role of mindsets as mediators of self-beliefs and how CSIBI may be adapted to other K-12 project-based learning settings. Method: We administered the instrument to 303 novice CS secondary students who largely came from historically marginalized backgrounds (gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status). We assessed the nine-factor structure for the 32-item instrument using confirmatory factor analysis and tested the hypothesized model of mindsets as mediators with structural equation modeling. Findings: We confirmed the nine factor structure of CSIBI and found significant positive correlations across factors. The structural model results showed that problem solving competency beliefs and CS creative expression promoted programming growth mindset, which subsequently fostered students' programming self-concept. Implications: We validated an instrument to measure secondary students' self-beliefs in CS that fills several gaps in K-12 CS measurement tools by focusing on contexts of learning by designing. CSIBI can be easily adapted to other learning by designing computing education contexts."

Here we present some model-free methods that do not require access to the prediction function. This is useful when that function is proprietary and not available, or just extremely expensive. It is also useful when studying residuals from a model. The cohort Shapley (CS) method is model-free but has exponential cost in the dimension of the input space. A supervised on-manifold Shapley method from Frye et al. (2020) is also model free but requires as input a second black box model that has to be trained for the Shapley value problem. We introduce an integrated gradient (IG) version of cohort Shapley, called IGCS, with cost . We show that over the vast majority of the relevant unit cube that the IGCS value function is close to a multilinear function for which IGCS matches CS. Another benefit of IGCS is that is allows IG methods to be used with binary predictors. We use some area between curves (ABC) measures to quantify the performance of IGCS. On a problem from high energy physics we verify that IGCS has nearly the same ABCs as CS does. We also use it on a problem from computational chemistry in 1024 variables. We see there that IGCS attains much higher ABCs than we get from Monte Carlo sampling. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/cohortshapley/cohortintgrad"

Two key steps when formalizing with logical formalisms are to (a) choose a suitable vocabulary, that is, e.g., which propositional variables or first-order symbols to use, and with which intended meaning, and then to (b) construct actual formal descriptions, i.e. logical formulas over the chosen vocabulary. While (b) is addressed by several educational support systems for formal foundations of computer science, (a) is so far not addressed at all -- likely because it involves specifying the intended meaning of symbols in natural language. We propose a conceptual framework for educational tasks where students choose a vocabulary, including an enriched language for describing solution spaces as well as an NLP-approach for checking student attempts and providing feedback.

This CCS system is expected to yield better performance than each individual CS system, while requiring the same time as that needed for each individual CS system when a parallel computing strategy is used. We then provide an approach to designing optimal CCS systems by utilizing a measure that involves both the sensing matrix and dictionaries and hence allows us to simultaneously optimize the sensing matrix and all the dictionaries. An alternating minimization-based algorithm is derived for solving the corresponding optimal design problem. With a rigorous convergence analysis, we show that the proposed algorithm is convergent. Experiments are carried out to confirm the theoretical results and show that the proposed CCS system yields significant improvements over the existing CS systems in terms of the signal recovery accuracy."

In this paper, we extend the Turbo-CS algorithm to solve compressed sensing problems involving more general signal structure, including compressive image recovery and low-rank matrix recovery. A main difficulty for such an extension is that the original Turbo-CS algorithm requires prior knowledge of the signal distribution that is usually unavailable in practice. To overcome this difficulty, we propose to redesign the Turbo-CS algorithm by employing a generic denoiser that does not depend on the prior distribution and hence the name denoising-based Turbo-CS (D-Turbo-CS). We then derive the extrinsic information for a generic denoiser by following the Turbo-CS principle. Based on that, we optimize the parametric extrinsic denoisers to minimize the output mean-square error (MSE). Explicit expressions are derived for the extrinsic SURE-LET denoiser used in compressive image denoising and also for the singular value thresholding (SVT) denoiser used in low-rank matrix denoising. We find that the dynamics of D-Turbo-CS can be well described by a scaler recursion called MSE evolution, similar to the case for Turbo-CS. Numerical results demonstrate that D-Turbo-CS considerably outperforms the counterpart algorithms in both reconstruction quality and running time."

Although CS-AG has been widely studied, they still face three challenges. (1) Exact methods based on graph traversal are time-consuming, especially for large graphs. Some tailored indices can improve efficiency, but introduce nonnegligible storage and maintenance overhead. (2) Approximate methods with a loose approximation ratio only provide a coarse-grained evaluation of a community's quality, rather than a reliable evaluation with an accuracy guarantee in runtime. (3) Attribute cohesiveness metrics often ignores the important correlation with the query node . We formally define our CS-AG problem atop a -centric attribute cohesiveness metric considering both textual and numerical attributes, for -core model on homogeneous graphs. We show the problem is NP-hard. To solve it, we first propose an exact baseline with three pruning strategies. Then, we propose an index-free sampling-estimation-based method to quickly return an approximate community with an accuracy guarantee, in the form of a confidence interval. Once a good result satisfying a user-desired error bound is reached, we terminate it early. We extend it to heterogeneous graphs, -truss model, and size-bounded CS. Comprehensive experimental studies on ten real-world datasets show its superiority, e.g., at least 1.54 (41.1 on average) faster in response time and a reliable relative error (within a user-specific error bound) of attribute cohesiveness is achieved."

    "summary": "Compressive learning (CL) is an emerging framework that integrates signal acquisition via compressed sensing (CS) and machine learning for inference tasks directly on a small number of measurements. It can be a promising alternative to classical image-domain methods and enjoys great advantages in memory saving and computational efficiency. However, previous attempts on CL are not only limited to a fixed CS ratio, which lacks flexibility, but also limited to MNIST/CIFAR-like datasets and do not scale to complex real-world high-resolution (HR) data or vision tasks. In this paper, a novel transformer-based compressive learning framework on large-scale images with arbitrary CS ratios, dubbed TransCL, is proposed. Specifically, TransCL first utilizes the strategy of learnable block-based compressed sensing and proposes a flexible linear projection strategy to enable CL to be performed on large-scale images in an efficient block-by-block manner with arbitrary CS ratios. Then, regarding CS measurements from all blocks as a sequence, a pure transformer-based backbone is deployed to perform vision tasks with various task-oriented heads. Our sufficient analysis presents that TransCL exhibits strong resistance to interference and robust adaptability to arbitrary CS ratios. Extensive experiments for complex HR data demonstrate that the proposed TransCL can achieve state-of-the-art performance in image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. In particular, TransCL with a CS ratio of can obtain almost the same performance as when operating directly on the original data and can still obtain satisfying performance even with an extremely low CS ratio of .

The NLP community has mostly focused on monolingual and multi-lingual scenarios, but little attention has been given to CS in particular. This is partly because of the lack of resources and annotated data, despite its increasing occurrence in social media platforms. In this paper, we aim at adapting monolingual models to code-switched text in various tasks. Specifically, we transfer English knowledge from a pre-trained ELMo model to different code-switched language pairs (i.e., Nepali-English, Spanish-English, and Hindi-English) using the task of language identification. Our method, CS-ELMo, is an extension of ELMo with a simple yet effective position-aware attention mechanism inside its character convolutions. We show the effectiveness of this transfer learning step by outperforming multilingual BERT and homologous CS-unaware ELMo models and establishing a new state of the art in CS tasks, such as NER and POS tagging. Our technique can be expanded to more English-paired code-switched languages, providing more resources to the CS community."

    "summary": "Compressed sensing (CS) is an emerging field that has attracted considerable research interest over the past few years. Previous review articles in CS limit their scope to standard discrete-to-discrete measurement architectures using matrices of randomized nature and signal models based on standard sparsity. In recent years, CS has worked its way into several new application areas. This, in turn, necessitates a fresh look on many of the basics of CS. The random matrix measurement operator must be replaced by more structured sensing architectures that correspond to the characteristics of feasible acquisition hardware. The standard sparsity prior has to be extended to include a much richer class of signals and to encode broader data models, including continuous-time signals. In our overview, the theme is exploiting signal and measurement structure in compressive sensing. The prime focus is bridging theory and practice; that is, to pinpoint the potential of structured CS strategies to emerge from the math to the hardware. Our summary highlights new directions as well as relations to more traditional CS, with the hope of serving both as a review to practitioners wanting to join this emerging field, and as a reference for researchers that attempts to put some of the existing ideas in perspective of practical applications."

For example, CS can exploit the structure of natural images and recover an image from only a few random measurements. CS is flexible and data efficient, but its application has been restricted by the strong assumption of sparsity and costly reconstruction process. A recent approach that combines CS with neural network generators has removed the constraint of sparsity, but reconstruction remains slow. Here we propose a novel framework that significantly improves both the performance and speed of signal recovery by jointly training a generator and the optimisation process for reconstruction via meta-learning. We explore training the measurements with different objectives, and derive a family of models based on minimising measurement errors. We show that Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) can be viewed as a special case in this family of models. Borrowing insights from the CS perspective, we develop a novel way of improving GANs using gradient information from the discriminator."

Another way is by applying Compressed Sensing (CS) to UWB system for achieving sub-mm positioning accuracy. In this paper, we compare different TDOA-based UWB systems with different sampling methods. In particular, several CS-UWB algorithms for UWB signal reconstruction are compared in terms of positioning accuracy. Simulation results in 2D and 3D experiments demonstrate performance of different algorithms including typical BCS, OMP and BP algorithms. CS-UWB is also compared with UWB positioning system based on the sequential sampling method."

    "title": "Image Super-Resolution with Cross-Scale Non-Local Attention and Exhaustive Self-Exemplars Mining",
    "summary": "Deep convolution-based single image super-resolution (SISR) networks embrace the benefits of learning from large-scale external image resources for local recovery, yet most existing works have ignored the long-range feature-wise similarities in natural images. Some recent works have successfully leveraged this intrinsic feature correlation by exploring non-local attention modules. However, none of the current deep models have studied another inherent property of images: cross-scale feature correlation. In this paper, we propose the first Cross-Scale Non-Local (CS-NL) attention module with integration into a recurrent neural network. By combining the new CS-NL prior with local and in-scale non-local priors in a powerful recurrent fusion cell, we can find more cross-scale feature correlations within a single low-resolution (LR) image. The performance of SISR is significantly improved by exhaustively integrating all possible priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CS-NL module by setting new state-of-the-arts on multiple SISR benchmarks."

    "title": "DiSCo: LLM Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Sparse Retrieval in Conversational Search",
    "summary": "Conversational Search (CS) involves retrieving relevant documents from a corpus while considering the conversational context, integrating retrieval with context modeling. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced CS by enabling query rewriting based on conversational context. However, employing LLMs during inference poses efficiency challenges. Existing solutions mitigate this issue by distilling embeddings derived from human-rewritten queries, focusing primarily on learning the context modeling task. These methods, however, often separate the contrastive retrieval task from the distillation process, treating it as an independent loss term. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DiSCo (Distillation of Sparse Conversational retrieval), a novel approach that unifies retrieval and context modeling through a relaxed distillation objective. Instead of relying exclusively on representation learning, our method distills similarity scores between conversations and documents, providing more freedom in the representation space and better leveraging the contrastive nature of document relevance. Extensive experiments on Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) across five CS datasets demonstrate that DiSCo achieves substantial improvements in both in-domain and out-of-domain retrieval tasks, achieving up to a six-point gain in recall for out-of-domain datasets over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, DiSCo employs a multi-teacher distillation strategy, using multiple LLMs as teachers, further enhancing performance and surpassing the individual teachers in in-domain settings. Furthermore, analysis of model sparsity reveals that DiSCo allows for more effective control over the sparsity of the trained models."

    "title": "Efficient Neural Network based Classification and Outlier Detection for Image Moderation using Compressed Sensing and Group Testing",
    "summary": "Popular social media platforms employ neural network based image moderation engines to classify images uploaded on them as having potentially objectionable content. Such moderation engines must answer a large number of queries with heavy computational cost, even though the actual number of images with objectionable content is usually a tiny fraction. Inspired by recent work on Neural Group Testing, we propose an approach which exploits this fact to reduce the overall computational cost of such engines using the technique of Compressed Sensing (CS). We present the quantitative matrix-pooled neural network (QMPNN), which takes as input images, and a binary pooling matrix with , whose rows indicate pools of images i.e. selections of images out of . The QMPNN efficiently outputs the product of this matrix with the unknown sparse binary vector indicating whether each image is objectionable or not, i.e. it outputs the number of objectionable images in each pool. For suitable matrices, this is decoded using CS decoding algorithms to predict which images were objectionable. The computational cost of running the QMPNN and the CS algorithms is significantly lower than the cost of using a neural network with the same number of parameters separately on each image to classify the images, which we demonstrate via extensive experiments. Our technique is inherently resilient to moderate levels of errors in the prediction from the QMPNN. Furthermore, we present pooled deep outlier detection, which brings CS and group testing techniques to deep outlier detection, to provide for the case when the objectionable images do not belong to a set of pre-defined classes. This technique enables efficient automated moderation of off-topic images shared on topical forums dedicated to sharing images of a certain single class, many of which are currently human-moderated."

    "title": "A Dimension-Keeping Semi-Tensor Product Framework for Compressed Sensing",
    "summary": "In compressed sensing (CS), sparse signals can be reconstructed from significantly fewer samples than required by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. While non-sparse signals can be sparsely represented in appropriate transformation domains, conventional CS frameworks rely on the incoherence of the measurement matrix columns to guarantee reconstruction performance. This paper proposes a novel method termed Dimension-Keeping Semi-Tensor Product Compressed Sensing (DK-STP-CS), which leverages intra-group correlations while maintaining inter-group incoherence to enhance the measurement matrix design. Specifically, the DK-STP algorithm is integrated into the design of the sensing matrix, enabling dimensionality reduction while preserving signal recovery capability. For image compression and reconstruction tasks, the proposed method achieves notable noise suppression and improves visual fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that DK-STP-CS significantly outperforms traditional CS and STP-CS approaches, as evidenced by higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values between the reconstructed and original images. The robustness of DK-STP-CS is further validated under noisy conditions and varying sampling rates, highlighting its potential for practical applications in resource-constrained environments."

    "summary": "Understanding student perceptions of assessment is vital for designing inclusive and effective learning environments, especially in technical education. This study explores engineering students' perceptions of assessment practices in an introductory computer science/ programming course, and its associated laboratory within an Indian engineering institute context. A total of 318 first-year Bachelor of Technology students participated in a weekly 25-statement Likert-scale survey conducted over nine weeks. Using descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis), the analysis reveals that students largely perceive lab assignments as effective learning activities and view exams and projects as authentic and skill-enhancing. Students appreciated the role of instructors in shaping course content and found teaching assistants to be approachable and helpful, despite some inconsistencies. The study also finds significant variations in students' academic performance and assessment perceptions based on prior programming experience, technology familiarity, gender, and academic branch. Notably, the performance data did not follow a Gaussian distribution, challenging common assumptions in grade modeling. A comparative analysis with European cohorts highlights both universal patterns and contextual differences, offering valuable insights for designing inclusive and equitable assessment strategies in programming education."

    "title": "Maximum Correntropy Adaptive Filtering Approach for Robust Compressive Sensing Reconstruction",
    "summary": "Robust compressive sensing(CS) reconstruction has become an attractive research topic in recent years. Robust CS aims to reconstruct the sparse signals under non-Gaussian(i.e. heavy tailed) noises where traditional CS reconstruction algorithms may perform very poorly due to utilizing norm of the residual vector in optimization. Most of existing robust CS reconstruction algorithms are based on greedy pursuit method or convex relaxation approach. Recently, the adaptive filtering framework has been introduced to deal with the CS reconstruction, which shows desirable performance in both efficiency and reconstruction performance under Gaussian noise. In this paper, we propose an adaptive filtering based robust CS reconstruction algorithm, called regularized maximum correntropy criterion( -MCC) algorithm, which combines the adaptive filtering framework and maximum correntropy criterion(MCC). MCC has recently been successfully used in adaptive filtering due to its robustness to impulsive non-Gaussian noises and low computational complexity. We analyze theoretically the stability of the proposed -MCC algorithm. A mini-batch based -MCC(MB- -MCC) algorithm is further developed to speed up the convergence. Comparison with existing robust CS reconstruction algorithms is conducted via simulations, showing that the proposed -MCC and MB- -MCC can achieve significantly better performance than other algorithms."

CS theory requires solving a convex constrained minimization problem. We propose to transform this optimization problem into a convex feasibility problem (CFP), and solve it using subgradient projection methods, which are iterative, fast, robust and convergent schemes for solving CFPs. As opposed to some of the recently-introduced CS algorithms, such as Bayesian CS and gradient projections for sparse reconstruction, which become inefficient as the problem dimension and sparseness degree increase, the newly-proposed methods exhibit a marked robustness with respect to these factors. This renders the subgradient projection methods highly viable for large-scale compressible scenarios."

This poses significant challenges to computing education, particularly the teaching of introductory programming and advanced software engineering (SE) courses. First-year programming courses often face overwhelming enrollments, including interdisciplinary students who are not CS majors. The high teacher-to-student ratio makes it challenging to provide timely and high-quality feedback. Meanwhile, software engineering education comes with inherent difficulties like acquiring industry partners and the dilemma that such software projects are often under or over-specified and one-time efforts within one team or one course. To address these challenges, we designed a novel foundational SE course. This SE course envisions building a full-fledged Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) of Programming Assignments to provide automated, real-time feedback for novice students in programming courses over multiple years. Each year, SE students contribute to specific short-running SE projects that improve the existing ITS implementation, while at the same time, we can deploy the ITS for usage by students for learning programming. This project setup builds awareness among SE students about their contribution to a \"to-be-deployed\" software project. In this multi-year teaching effort, we have incrementally built an ITS that is now deployed in various programming courses. This paper discusses the Intelligent Tutoring System architecture, our teaching concept in the SE course, our experience with the built ITS, and our view of future computing education."

    "summary": "Using infrared data from the Herschel Space Observatory and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) 3 GHz observations in the COSMOS field, we investigate the redshift evolution of the infrared-radio correlation (IRRC) for star-forming galaxies (SFGs) we classify as either spheroid- or disc-dominated based on their morphology. The sample predominantly consists of disc galaxies with stellar mass , and residing on the star-forming main sequence (MS). After the removal of AGN using standard approaches, we observe a significant difference between the redshift-evolution of the median IR/radio ratio of (i) a sample of ellipticals, plus discs with a substantial bulge component (`spheroid-dominated' SFGs) and, (ii) virtually pure discs and irregular systems (`disc-dominated' SFGs). The spheroid-dominated population follows a declining vs. trend similar to that measured in recent evolutionary studies of the IRRC. However, for disc-dominated galaxies, where radio and IR emission should be linked to star formation in the most straightforward way, we measure very little change in . This suggests that low-redshift calibrations of radio emission as an SFR-tracer may remain valid out to at least for pure star-forming systems. We find that the different redshift-evolution of for the spheroid- and disc-dominated sample is mainly due to an increasing radio excess for spheroid-dominated galaxies at 0.8, hinting at some residual AGN activity in these systems. This finding demonstrates that in the absence of AGN the IRRC is independent of redshift, and that radio observations can therefore be used to estimate SFRs at all redshifts for genuinely star-forming galaxies."

    "title": "Convergence rates for the joint solution of inverse problems with compressed sensing data",
    "summary": "Compressed sensing (CS) is a powerful tool for reducing the amount of data to be collected while maintaining high spatial resolution. Such techniques work well in practice and at the same time are supported by solid theory. Standard CS results assume measurements to be made directly on the targeted signal. In many practical applications, however, CS information can only be taken from indirect data related to the original signal by an additional forward operator. If inverting the forward operator is ill-posed, then existing CS theory is not applicable. In this paper, we address this issue and present two joint reconstruction approaches, namely relaxed co-regularization and strict co-regularization, for CS from indirect data. As main results, we derive error estimates for recovering and . In particular, we derive a linear convergence rate in the norm for the latter. To obtain these results, solutions are required to satisfy a source condition and the CS measurement operator is required to satisfy a restricted injectivity condition. We further show that these conditions are not only sufficient but even necessary to obtain linear convergence."

    "summary": "This paper is devoted to the online dominating set problem and its variants. We believe the paper represents the first systematic study of the effect of two limitations of online algorithms: making irrevocable decisions while not knowing the future, and being incremental, i.e., having to maintain solutions to all prefixes of the input. This is quantified through competitive analyses of online algorithms against two optimal algorithms, both knowing the entire input, but only one having to be incremental. We also consider the competitive ratio of the weaker of the two optimal algorithms against the other. We consider important graph classes, distinguishing between connected and not necessarily connected graphs. For the classic graph classes of trees, bipartite, planar, and general graphs, we obtain tight results in almost all cases. We also derive upper and lower bounds for the class of bounded-degree graphs. From these analyses, we get detailed information regarding the significance of the necessary requirement that online algorithms be incremental. In some cases, having to be incremental fully accounts for the online algorithm's disadvantage."

    "title": "Nonlinear compressed sensing based on composite mappings and its pointwise linearization",
    "summary": "Classical compressed sensing (CS) allows us to recover structured signals from far few linear measurements than traditionally prescribed, thereby efficiently decreasing sampling rates. However, if there exist nonlinearities in the measurements, is it still possible to recover sparse or structured signals from the nonlinear measurements? The research of nonlinear CS is devoted to answering this question. In this paper, unlike the existing research angles of nonlinear CS, we study it from the perspective of mapping decomposition, and propose a new concept, namely, nonlinear CS based on composite mappings. Through the analysis of two forms of a nonlinear composite mapping Phi, i.e., Phi(x) = F(Ax) and Phi(x) = AF(x), we give the requirements respectively for the sensing matrix A and the nonlinear mapping F when reconstructing all sparse signals exactly from the nonlinear measurements Phi(x). Besides, we also provide a special pointwise linearization method, which can turn the nonlinear composite mapping Phi, at each point in its domain, into an equivalent linear composite mapping. This linearization method can guarantee the exact recovery of all given sparse signals even if Phi is not an injection for all sparse signals. It may help us build an algorithm framework for the composite nonlinear CS in which we can take full advantage of the existing recovery algorithms belonging to linear CS."

    "title": "On the Design of Channel Shortening Demodulators for Iterative Receivers in MIMO and ISI Channels",
    "summary": "We consider the problem of designing demodulators for linear vector channels with memory that use reduced-size trellis descriptions for the received signal. We assume an overall iterative receiver, and for the parts of the signal not covered by the trellis description, we use interference cancelation based on the soft information provided by the outer decoder. In order to reach a trellis description, a linear filter is applied as front-end to compress the signal structure into a small trellis. This process requires three parameters to be designed: (i) the front-end filter, (ii) the feedback filter through which the interference cancelation is done, and (iii) a target response which specifies the trellis. Demodulators of this form have been studied before under then name channel shortening (CS), but the interplay between CS and interference cancelation has not been adequately addressed in the literature. In this paper, we analyze two types of CS demodulators that are based on the Forney and Ungerboeck detection models, respectively. The parameters are jointly optimized based on a generalized mutual information (GMI) function. We also introduce a third type of CS demodulator that is in general suboptimal but has closed form solutions for all parameters. Moreover, signal to noise ratio (SNR) asymptotic properties are analyzed and we show that the third CS demodulator asymptotically converges to the optimal CS demodulator in the sense of maximizing the GMI."

The checker uses an untrusted oracle based on these witnesses and is able to verify the smaller case of 8 inputs within a couple of days, but it did not scale to the full proof for 9 inputs. In this paper, we describe several non-trivial optimizations of the algorithm in the checker, obtained by appropriately changing the formalization and capitalizing on the symbiosis with an adequate implementation of the oracle. We provide experimental evidence of orders of magnitude improvements to both runtime and memory footprint for 8 inputs, and actually manage to check the full proof for 9 inputs."

    "title": "Cutting-Splicing data augmentation: A novel technology for medical image segmentation",
    "summary": "Background: Medical images are more difficult to acquire and annotate than natural images, which results in data augmentation technologies often being used in medical image segmentation tasks. Most data augmentation technologies used in medical segmentation were originally developed on natural images and do not take into account the characteristic that the overall layout of medical images is standard and fixed. Methods: Based on the characteristics of medical images, we developed the cutting-splicing data augmentation (CS-DA) method, a novel data augmentation technology for medical image segmentation. CS-DA augments the dataset by splicing different position components cut from different original medical images into a new image. The characteristics of the medical image result in the new image having the same layout as and similar appearance to the original image. Compared with classical data augmentation technologies, CS-DA is simpler and more robust. Moreover, CS-DA does not introduce any noise or fake information into the newly created image. Results: To explore the properties of CS-DA, many experiments are conducted on eight diverse datasets. On the training dataset with the small sample size, CS-DA can effectively increase the performance of the segmentation model. When CS-DA is used together with classical data augmentation technologies, the performance of the segmentation model can be further improved and is much better than that of CS-DA and classical data augmentation separately. We also explored the influence of the number of components, the position of the cutting line, and the splicing method on the CS-DA performance. Conclusions: The excellent performance of CS-DA in the experiment has confirmed the effectiveness of CS-DA, and provides a new data augmentation idea for the small sample segmentation task."

    "summary": "Cued Speech (CS) is a visual coding tool to encode spoken languages at the phonetic level, which combines lip-reading and hand gestures to effectively assist communication among people with hearing impairments. The Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) task aims to recognize CS videos into linguistic texts, which involves both lips and hands as two distinct modalities conveying complementary information. However, the traditional centralized training approach poses potential privacy risks due to the use of facial and gesture videos in CS data. To address this issue, we propose a new Federated Cued Speech Recognition (FedCSR) framework to train an ACSR model over the decentralized CS data without sharing private information. In particular, a mutual knowledge distillation method is proposed to maintain cross-modal semantic consistency of the Non-IID CS data, which ensures learning a unified feature space for both linguistic and visual information. On the server side, a globally shared linguistic model is trained to capture the long-term dependencies in the text sentences, which is aligned with the visual information from the local clients via visual-to-linguistic distillation. On the client side, the visual model of each client is trained with its own local data, assisted by linguistic-to-visual distillation treating the linguistic model as the teacher. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to consider the federated ACSR task for privacy protection. Experimental results on the Chinese CS dataset with multiple cuers demonstrate that our approach outperforms both mainstream federated learning baselines and existing centralized state-of-the-art ACSR methods, achieving 9.7% performance improvement for character error rate (CER) and 15.0% for word error rate (WER)."

In previous work, we have proposed several automatic transcription strategies for CS speech to increase the amount of available training speech data. In this work, we explore how the acoustic modeling (AM) can benefit from monolingual speech data belonging to the high-resourced mixed language. For this purpose, we train state-of-the-art AMs, which were ineffective due to lack of training data, on a significantly increased amount of CS speech and monolingual Dutch speech. Moreover, we improve the language model (LM) by creating code-switching text, which is in practice almost non-existent, by (1) generating text using recurrent LMs trained on the transcriptions of the training CS speech data, (2) adding the transcriptions of the automatically transcribed CS speech data and (3) translating Dutch text extracted from the transcriptions of a large Dutch speech corpora.

Compared with CS and 1-bit CS, HCS allows the signal to be dense, takes considerably less (linear) recovery time and requires substantially less measurements ( ). Moreover, HCS recovery can accelerate the subsequent 1-bit CS dequantizer.

Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) provides a promising way to directly measure plant productivity from space. However, satellite SIF observations are only available at a coarse spatial resolution, making it impossible to monitor how individual crop types or farms are doing. This poses a challenging coarsely-supervised regression (or downscaling) task; at training time, we only have SIF labels at a coarse resolution (3km), but we want to predict SIF at much finer spatial resolutions (e.g. 30m, a 100x increase). We also have additional fine-resolution input features, but the relationship between these features and SIF is unknown. To address this, we propose Coarsely-Supervised Smooth U-Net (CS-SUNet), a novel method for this coarse supervision setting. CS-SUNet combines the expressive power of deep convolutional networks with novel regularization methods based on prior knowledge (such as a smoothness loss) that are crucial for preventing overfitting. Experiments show that CS-SUNet resolves fine-grained variations in SIF more accurately than existing methods."

However, most of the previous work in WSN has used CS under the assumption that data field is smooth with negligible white Gaussian noise. In these schemes signal sparsity is estimated globally based on the entire data field, which is then used to determine the CS parameters. In more realistic scenarios, where data field may have regional fluctuations or it is piecewise smooth, existing CS based data aggregation schemes yield poor compression efficiency. In order to take full advantage of CS in WSNs, we propose an Adaptive Hierarchical Data Aggregation using Compressive Sensing (A-HDACS) scheme. The proposed schemes dynamically chooses sparsity values based on signal variations in local regions. We prove that A-HDACS enables more sensor nodes to employ CS compared to the schemes that do not adapt to the changing field. The simulation results also demonstrate the improvement in energy efficiency as well as accurate signal recovery."

In information-theoretic sense, it is known that a CS-based cryptosystem can be perfectly secure if it employs a random Gaussian sensing matrix updated at each encryption and its plaintext has constant energy. In this paper, we propose a new CS-based cryptosystem that employs a secret bipolar keystream and a public unitary matrix, which can be suitable for practical implementation by generating and renewing the keystream in a fast and efficient manner. We demonstrate that the sensing matrix is asymptotically Gaussian for a sufficiently large plaintext length, which guarantees a reliable CS decryption for a legitimate recipient. By means of probability metrics, we also show that the new CS-based cryptosystem can have the indistinguishability against an adversary, as long as the keystream is updated at each encryption and each plaintext has constant energy. Finally, we investigate how much the security of the new CS-based cryptosystem is sensitive to energy variation of plaintexts."

This article helps researchers to find those niche applications where the CS approach provides substantial gain over conventional approaches by articulating lessons learned in finding one such application; sea skimming missile detection. As a proof of concept, it is demonstrated that a simplified CS missile detection architecture and algorithm provides comparable results to the conventional imaging approach but using a smaller FPA. The primary message is that all of the excitement surrounding CS is necessary and appropriate for encouraging our creativity but we all must also take off our \"rose colored glasses\" and critically judge our ideas, methods and results relative to conventional imaging approaches."

As a result, the low-complexity encoding virtue of CS is fully leveraged in the resource-constrained sensing devices but its highcomplexity decoding problem is effectively addressed in cloud. It seems to be perfect but privacy and security concerns are ignored. In this paper, a secure outsourcing scheme for CS reconstruction service is proposed.

Our results show that inverse defect prediction can identify approx. 32-44% of the methods of a project to have a low fault risk; on average, they are about six times less likely to contain a fault than other methods. In cross-project predictions with larger, more diversified training sets, identified methods are even eleven times less likely to contain a fault. Conclusions. Inverse defect prediction supports the efficient allocation of test resources by identifying methods that can be treated with less priority in testing activities and is well applicable in cross-project prediction scenarios."

    "summary": "We consider the problem of online graph multi-coloring with advice. Multi-coloring is often used to model frequency allocation in cellular networks. We give several nearly tight upper and lower bounds for the most standard topologies of cellular networks, paths and hexagonal graphs. For the path, negative results trivially carry over to bipartite graphs, and our positive results are also valid for bipartite graphs. The advice given represents information that is likely to be available, studying for instance the data from earlier similar periods of time."

    "summary": "Multiple measurement vector (MMV) problem addresses the identification of unknown input vectors that share common sparse support. The MMV problems had been traditionally addressed either by sensor array signal processing or compressive sensing. However, recent breakthrough in this area such as compressive MUSIC (CS-MUSIC) or subspace-augumented MUSIC (SA-MUSIC) optimally combines the compressive sensing (CS) and array signal processing such that supports are first found by CS and the remaining supports are determined by generalized MUSIC criterion, where and denote the sparsity and the independent snapshots, respectively. Even though such hybrid approach significantly outperforms the conventional algorithms, its performance heavily depends on the correct identification of partial support by compressive sensing step, which often deteriorate the overall performance. The main contribution of this paper is, therefore, to show that as long as correct supports are included in any -sparse CS solution, the optimal partial support can be found using a subspace fitting criterion, significantly improving the overall performance of CS-MUSIC. Furthermore, unlike the single measurement CS counterpart that requires infinite SNR for a perfect support recovery, we can derive an information theoretic sufficient condition for the perfect recovery using CS-MUSIC under a finite SNR scenario."

    "summary": "The most common method to auto-grade a student's submission in a CS1 or a CS2 course is to run it against a pre-defined test suite and compare the results against reference results. However, this technique cannot be used if the correctness of the solution goes beyond simple output, such as the algorithm used to obtain the result. There is no convenient method for the graders to identify the kind of algorithm used in solving a problem. They must read the source code and understand the algorithm implemented and its features, which makes the process tedious. We propose CASET(Complexity Analysis using Simple Execution Traces), a novel tool to analyze the time complexity of algorithms using dynamic traces and unsupervised machine learning. CASET makes it convenient for tutors to classify the submissions for a program into time complexity baskets. Thus, tutors can identify the algorithms used by the submissions without necessarily going through the code written by the students. CASET's analysis can be used to improve grading and provide detailed feedback for submissions that try to match the results without a proper algorithm, for example, hard-coding a binary result, pattern-matching the visible or common inputs. We show the effectiveness of CASET by computing the time complexity of many classes of algorithms like sorting, searching and those using dynamic programming paradigm."

    "summary": "Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has been recognized as a promising multiple access technique. We propose a novel architecture for downlink RSMA, namely Codeword-Segmentation RSMA (CS-RSMA). Different from conventional RSMA which splits users' messages into common and private parts before encoding, CS-RSMA encodes the users' messages directly, segments the codewords into common and private parts, and transmits the codeword segments using common and private streams. In addition to the principle of CS-RSMA, a novel performance analysis framework is proposed. This framework utilizes a recent discovery in mismatched decoding under finite-alphabet input and interference, and can better capture the receiver's complexity limits. Precoder optimization under finite alphabets and suboptimal decoders for conventional RSMA and CS-RSMA to maximize the Sum-Rate (SR) and the Max-Min Fairness (MMF) is also addressed. The numerical results reveal the theoretical performance of conventional RSMA and CS-RSMA. We observe that CS-RSMA leads to better performance than conventional RSMA in SR, and similar performance in MMF. Furthermore, a physical-layer implementation of CS-RSMA is proposed and evaluated through link-level simulations. Aside performance benefits, we also demonstrate that CS-RSMA brings significant benefits on the encoding/decoding, control signaling, and retransmission process compared to conventional RSMA."

    "title": "Real-time Semantic Segmentation with Fast Attention",
    "summary": "In deep CNN based models for semantic segmentation, high accuracy relies on rich spatial context (large receptive fields) and fine spatial details (high resolution), both of which incur high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture that addresses both challenges and achieves state-of-the-art performance for semantic segmentation of high-resolution images and videos in real-time. The proposed architecture relies on our fast spatial attention, which is a simple yet efficient modification of the popular self-attention mechanism and captures the same rich spatial context at a small fraction of the computational cost, by changing the order of operations. Moreover, to efficiently process high-resolution input, we apply an additional spatial reduction to intermediate feature stages of the network with minimal loss in accuracy thanks to the use of the fast attention module to fuse features. We validate our method with a series of experiments, and show that results on multiple datasets demonstrate superior performance with better accuracy and speed compared to existing approaches for real-time semantic segmentation. On Cityscapes, our network achieves 74.4 mIoU at 72 FPS and 75.5 mIoU at 58 FPS on a single Titan X GPU, which is~ 50 faster than the state-of-the-art while retaining the same accuracy."

    "summary": "Compressed Sensing (CS) seeks to recover an unknown vector with entries by making far fewer than measurements; it posits that the number of compressed sensing measurements should be comparable to the information content of the vector, not simply . CS combines the important task of compression directly with the measurement task. Since its introduction in 2004 there have been hundreds of manuscripts on CS, a large fraction of which develop algorithms to recover a signal from its compressed measurements. Because of the paradoxical nature of CS -- exact reconstruction from seemingly undersampled measurements -- it is crucial for acceptance of an algorithm that rigorous analyses verify the degree of undersampling the algorithm permits. The Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) has become the dominant tool used for the analysis in such cases. We present here an asymmetric form of RIP which gives tighter bounds than the usual symmetric one. We give the best known bounds on the RIP constants for matrices from the Gaussian ensemble. Our derivations illustrate the way in which the combinatorial nature of CS is controlled. Our quantitative bounds on the RIP allow precise statements as to how aggressively a signal can be undersampled, the essential question for practitioners. We also document the extent to which RIP gives precise information about the true performance limits of CS, by comparing with approaches from high-dimensional geometry."

    "summary": "Dynamic pricing is a promising strategy to address the challenges of smart charging, as traditional time-of-use (ToU) rates and stationary pricing (SP) do not dynamically react to changes in operating conditions, reducing revenue for charging station (CS) vendors and affecting grid stability. Previous studies evaluated single objectives or linear combinations of objectives for EV CS pricing solutions, simplifying trade-offs and preferences among objectives. We develop a novel formulation for the dynamic pricing problem by addressing multiple conflicting objectives efficiently instead of solely focusing on one objective or metric, as in earlier works. We find optimal trade-offs or Pareto solutions efficiently using Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms (NSGA) II and NSGA III. A dynamic pricing model quantifies the relationship between demand and price while simultaneously solving multiple conflicting objectives, such as revenue, quality of service (QoS), and peak-to-average ratios (PAR). A single method can only address some of the above aspects of dynamic pricing comprehensively. We present a three-part dynamic pricing approach using a Bayesian model, multi-objective optimization, and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) using pseudo-weight vectors. To address the research gap in CS pricing, our method selects solutions using revenue, QoS, and PAR metrics simultaneously. Two California charging sites' real-world data validates our approach."

    "summary": "Tensor Compressive Sensing (TCS) is a multidimensional framework of Compressive Sensing (CS), and it is advantageous in terms of reducing the amount of storage, easing hardware implementations and preserving multidimensional structures of signals in comparison to a conventional CS system. In a TCS system, instead of using a random sensing matrix and a predefined dictionary, the average-case performance can be further improved by employing an optimized multidimensional sensing matrix and a learned multilinear sparsifying dictionary. In this paper, we propose a joint optimization approach of the sensing matrix and dictionary for a TCS system. For the sensing matrix design in TCS, an extended separable approach with a closed form solution and a novel iterative non-separable method are proposed when the multilinear dictionary is fixed. In addition, a multidimensional dictionary learning method that takes advantages of the multidimensional structure is derived, and the influence of sensing matrices is taken into account in the learning process. A joint optimization is achieved via alternately iterating the optimization of the sensing matrix and dictionary. Numerical experiments using both synthetic data and real images demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approaches."

In this paper, we present a deep learning approach to obtain very sparse ternary projections for compressed sensing. Our deep learning architecture jointly learns a pair of a projection matrix and a reconstruction operator in an end-to-end fashion. The experimental results on real images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, with significant advantage in terms of complexity."

Although the CS-based perfectly secure scheme has no such vulnerabilities, the practical realization of the perfectly secure scheme is challenging, because it requires an additional secure channel to transmit the measurement norm. In this paper, we devise a practical realization of a perfectly secure scheme by concealing energy in which the requirement of an additional secure channel is removed. Since the generation of Gaussian sensing matrices is not feasible in resource-constrained IoT devices, approximate Gaussian sensing matrices are generated using linear feedback shift registers. We also demonstrate the implementation feasibility of the proposed perfectly secure scheme in practice without additional complexity. Furthermore, the security analysis of the proposed scheme is performed and compared with the state-of-the-art compressive sensing based energy obfuscation scheme."

    "title": "Generalized Tensor Summation Compressive Sensing Network (GTSNET): An Easy to Learn Compressive Sensing Operation",
    "summary": "In CS literature, the efforts can be divided into two groups: finding a measurement matrix that preserves the compressed information at the maximum level, and finding a reconstruction algorithm for the compressed information. In the traditional CS setup, the measurement matrices are selected as random matrices, and optimization-based iterative solutions are used to recover the signals. However, when we handle large signals, using random matrices become cumbersome especially when it comes to iterative optimization-based solutions. Even though recent deep learning-based solutions boost the reconstruction accuracy performance while speeding up the recovery, still jointly learning the whole measurement matrix is a difficult process. In this work, we introduce a separable multi-linear learning of the CS matrix by representing it as the summation of arbitrary number of tensors. For a special case where the CS operation is set as a single tensor multiplication, the model is reduced to the learning-based separable CS; while a dense CS matrix can be approximated and learned as the summation of multiple tensors. Both cases can be used in CS of two or multi-dimensional signals e.g., images, multi-spectral images, videos, etc. Structural CS matrices can also be easily approximated and learned in our multi-linear separable learning setup with structural tensor sum representation. Hence, our learnable generalized tensor summation CS operation encapsulates most CS setups including separable CS, non-separable CS (traditional vector-matrix multiplication), structural CS, and CS of the multi-dimensional signals. For both gray-scale and RGB images, the proposed scheme surpasses most state-of-the-art solutions, especially in lower measurement rates. Although the performance gain remains limited from tensor to the sum of tensor representation for gray-scale images, it becomes significant in the RGB case."

In this paper, a practical coded MIMO-NOMA system with capacityapproaching performance as well as low implementation complexity is proposed. Specifically, the employed receiver consists of a multi-user Linear Minimum Mean-Square Error (LMMSE) detector and a bank of single-user message-passing decoders, which decompose the overall signal recovery into distributed low-complexity calculations. An asymptotic extrinsic information transfer analysis is proposed to estimate the performance of iterative receiver, where practical channel codes that match with the LMMSE detector in the iterative decoding perspective are constructed. As a result, the proposed coded MIMO-NOMA system achieves asymptotic performances within 0.2 dB from the theoretical capacity. Simulation results validate the reliability and robustness of the proposed system in practical settings, including various system loads, iteration numbers, code lengths, and channel conditions."

CS-BRM extends the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) approach to belief spaces and is based on the recently developed theory of covariance steering (CS) that enables guaranteed satisfaction of terminal belief constraints in finite-time. The nodes in the CS-BRM are sampled in belief space and represent distributions of the system states. A covariance steering controller steers the system from one BRM node to another, thus acting as an edge controller of the corresponding belief graph that ensures belief constraint satisfaction. After the edge controller is computed, a specific edge cost is assigned to that edge. The CS-BRM algorithm allows the sampling of non-stationary belief nodes, and thus is able to explore the velocity space and find efficient motion plans. The performance of CS-BRM is evaluated and compared to a previous belief space planning method, demonstrating the benefits of the proposed approach."

However, modified-CS depends heavily on the reliability of the known support. An important problem, which must be studied further, is the recoverability of modified-CS when the known support contains a number of errors. In this letter, we analyze the recoverability of modified-CS in a stochastic framework. A sufficient and necessary condition is established for exact recovery of a sparse signal. Utilizing this condition, the recovery probability that reflects the recoverability of modified-CS can be computed explicitly for a sparse signal with nonzero entries, even though the known support exists some errors. Simulation experiments have been carried out to validate our theoretical results."

    "title": "Greedy Algorithms for Hybrid Compressed Sensing",
    "summary": "Compressed sensing (CS) is a technique which uses fewer measurements than dictated by the Nyquist sampling theorem. The traditional CS with linear measurements achieves efficient recovery performances, but it suffers from the large bit consumption due to the huge storage occupied by those measurements. Then, the one-bit CS with binary measurements is proposed and saves the bit budget, but it is infeasible when the energy information of signals is not available as a prior knowledge. Subsequently, the hybrid CS which combines the traditional CS and one-bit CS appears, striking a balance between the pros and cons of both types of CS. Considering the fact that the one-bit CS is optimal for the direction estimation of signals under noise with a fixed bit budget and that the traditional CS is able to provide residue information and estimated signals, we focus on the design of greedy algorithms, which consist of the main steps of support detection and recovered signal update, for the hybrid CS in this paper. We first propose a theorem on the random uniform tessellations for sparse signals to further investigate the properties of one-bit CS. Afterwards, we propose two greedy algorithms for the hybrid CS, with the one-bit CS responsible for support detection and traditional CS offering updated residues and signal estimates. For each of the proposed algorithms, we provide the corresponding theorem with proof to analyze their capabilities theoretically. Simulation results have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed greedy algorithms under a limited bit budget in noisy environments."

    "summary": "Bin covering is a dual version of classic bin packing. Thus, the goal is to cover as many bins as possible, where covering a bin means packing items of total size at least one in the bin. For online bin covering, competitive analysis fails to distinguish between most algorithms of interest; all \"reasonable\" algorithms have a competitive ratio of 1/2. Thus, in order to get a better understanding of the combinatorial difficulties in solving this problem, we turn to other performance measures, namely relative worst order, random order, and max/max analysis, as well as analyzing input with restricted or uniformly distributed item sizes. In this way, our study also supplements the ongoing systematic studies of the relative strengths of various performance measures. Two classic algorithms for online bin packing that have natural dual versions are Harmonic and Next-Fit. Even though the algorithms are quite different in nature, the dual versions are not separated by competitive analysis. We make the case that when guarantees are needed, even under restricted input sequences, dual Harmonic is preferable. In addition, we establish quite robust theoretical results showing that if items come from a uniform distribution or even if just the ordering of items is uniformly random, then dual Next-Fit is the right choice."

The early identification has significant value in improving cure rate and reducing costs.

Besides, the time-consuming and costliness of hospital medical service reduces the attention to the CS identification. Thus, a convenient, low-cost intelligent CS identification method is imperious demanded. In this paper, we present an intelligent method based on the deep learning to identify CS, using the surface electromyography (sEMG) signal. Faced with the complex, high dimensionality and weak usability of the sEMG signal, we proposed and developed a multi-channel EasiCSDeep algorithm based on the convolutional neural network, which consists of the feature extraction, spatial relationship representation and classification algorithm.

Nevertheless, recoverability does not only depend on the signal, but also on the measurement scheme. The measurement matrix should behave as close as possible to an isometry for the signals of interest. Therefore the search for optimal CS measurement matrices of size translates into the search for a set of -dimensional vectors with minimal coherence. Best Complex Antipodal Spherical Codes (BCASCs) are known to be optimal in terms of coherence. An iterative algorithm for BCASC generation has been recently proposed that tightly approaches the theoretical lower bound on coherence. Unfortunately, the complexity of each iteration depends quadratically on and . In this work we propose a modification of the algorithm that allows reducing the quadratic complexity to linear on both and . Numerical evaluation showed that the proposed approach does not worsen the coherence of the resulting BCASCs. On the contrary, an improvement was observed for large . The reduction of the computational complexity paves the way for using the BCASCs as CS measurement matrices in problems with large .

Concept Sliders (CS) offer a promising direction by discovering semantic directions through textual contrasts, but they require per-concept training and architecture-specific fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA), limiting scalability to new modalities. In this work we introduce FreeSliders, a simple yet effective approach that is fully training-free and modality-agnostic, achieved by partially estimating the CS formula during inference. To support modality-agnostic evaluation, we extend the CS benchmark to include both video and audio, establishing the first suite for fine-grained concept generation control with multiple modalities. We further propose three evaluation properties along with new metrics to improve evaluation quality. Finally, we identify an open problem of scale selection and non-linear traversals and introduce a two-stage procedure that automatically detects saturation points and reparameterizes traversal for perceptually uniform, semantically meaningful edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method enables plug-and-play, training-free concept control across modalities, improves over existing baselines, and establishes new tools for principled controllable generation.

Second, we introduce a novel algorithm, Verifiable Client Selection FL (Veri-CS-FL), which employs ZKPs to refine the client selection process. In Veri-CS-FL, participating clients generate verifiable proofs for the performance metrics of their local models and submit these concise proofs to the server for efficient verification. The server then selects clients with high-quality local models for uploading, subsequently aggregating the contributions from these selected clients. By integrating ZKPs, Veri-CS-FL not only ensures the accuracy of performance metrics but also fortifies trust among participants while enhancing the overall efficiency and security of FL systems."

They employ models that ingest time-series monitoring sensor data and transform it into actionable knowledge for system tuning: a process known as Operational Data Analytics (ODA). However, monitoring data has a high dimensionality, is hardware-dependent and difficult to interpret. This, coupled with the strict requirements of ODA, makes most traditional data mining methods impractical and in turn renders this type of data cumbersome to process. Most current ODA solutions use ad-hoc processing methods that are not generic, are sensible to the sensors' features and are not fit for visualization. In this paper we propose a novel method, called Correlation-wise Smoothing (CS), to extract descriptive signatures from time-series monitoring data in a generic and lightweight way. Our CS method exploits correlations between data dimensions to form groups and produces image-like signatures that can be easily manipulated, visualized and compared. We evaluate the CS method on HPC-ODA, a collection of datasets that we release with this work, and show that it leads to the same performance as most state-of-the-art methods while producing signatures that are up to ten times smaller and up to ten times faster, while gaining visualizability, portability across systems and clear scaling properties."

The sensitive (noise ~16 micro-Jy beam ), high resolution ( < 10'') MeerKAT images show that the lobes of Fornax A have a double-shell morphology, where dense filaments are embedded in a diffuse and extended cocoon. We study the spectral properties of these components by combining the MeerKAT and SRT observations with archival data between 84 MHz and 217 GHz. For the first time, we show that multiple episodes of nuclear activity must have formed the extended radio lobes. The modelling of the radio spectrum suggests that the last episode of injection of relativistic particles into the lobes started ~ 24 Myr ago and stopped approximately 12 Myr ago. More recently (~ 3 Myr ago), a less powerful and short ( < 1 Myr) phase of nuclear activity generated the central jets. Currently, the core may be in a new active phase. It appears that Fornax A is rapidly flickering. The dense environment in which Fornax A lives has lead to a complex recent merger history for this galaxy, including mergers spanning a range of gas contents and mass ratios, as shown by the analysis of the galaxy's stellar- and cold-gas phases. This complex recent history may be the cause of the rapid, recurrent nuclear activity of Fornax A."

Much work has gone into exploring other performance measures, in particular targeted at what seems to be the core problem with competitive analysis: the comparison of the performance of an online algorithm is made to a too powerful adversary. We consider a new approach to restricting the power of the adversary, by requiring that when judging a given online algorithm, the optimal offline algorithm must perform as well as the online algorithm, not just on the entire final request sequence, but also on any prefix of that sequence. This is limiting the adversary's usual advantage of being able to exploit that it knows the sequence is continuing beyond the current request. Through a collection of online problems, including machine scheduling, bin packing, dual bin packing, and seat reservation, we investigate the significance of this particular offline advantage."

The members of this class experience powerful accretion outbursts and remain in an enhanced accretion state for decades or centuries. V1515 Cyg, a classical FUor, started brightening in the 1940s and reached its peak brightness in the late 1970s. Following a sudden decrease in brightness it stayed in a minimum state for a few months, then started a brightening for several years. We present results of our ground-based photometric monitoring complemented with optical/NIR spectroscopic monitoring. Our light curves show a long-term fading with strong variability on weekly and monthly time scales. The optical spectra show P Cygni profiles and broad blue-shifted absorption lines, common properties of FUors. However, V1515 Cyg lacks the P Cygni profile in the Ca II 8498 Å line, a part of the Ca infrared triplet (IRT), formed by an outflowing wind, suggesting that the absorbing gas in the wind is optically thin. The newly obtained near-infrared spectrum shows the strengthening of the CO bandhead and the FeH molecular band, indicating that the disk has become cooler since the last spectroscopic observation in 2015. The current luminosity of the accretion disk dropped from the peak value of 138 to about 45 , suggesting that the long-term fading is also partly caused by the dropping of the accretion rate."

Alternatively, for a fixed SNR of -1 dB, we achieve a 10 dB improvement in RSNR."

Samples collected from three different measurement methods; the uniform sampling, random sampling, and energy equipartition sampling, are used to reconstruct a given monocycle signal whose spectral energy density is known. Objective performance evaluation in term of PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) indicates empirically that the CS reconstruction of random sampling outperform the uniform sampling, while the energy equipartition sampling outperforms both of them.

This paper examines the use of CS in the design of a wideband radio receiver in a noisy environment. We formulate the problem statement for such a receiver and establish a reasonable set of requirements that a receiver should meet to be practically useful. We then evaluate the performance of a CS-based receiver in two ways: via a theoretical analysis of its expected performance, with a particular emphasis on noise and dynamic range, and via simulations that compare the CS receiver against the performance expected from a conventional implementation. On the one hand, we show that CS-based systems that aim to reduce the number of acquired measurements are somewhat sensitive to signal noise, exhibiting a 3dB SNR loss per octave of subsampling, which parallels the classic noise-folding phenomenon. On the other hand, we demonstrate that since they sample at a lower rate, CS-based systems can potentially attain a significantly larger dynamic range. Hence, we conclude that while a CS-based system has inherent limitations that do impose some restrictions on its potential applications, it also has attributes that make it highly desirable in a number of important practical settings."

    "title": "Bi-level Protected Compressive Sampling",
    "summary": "Some pioneering works have investigated embedding cryptographic properties in compressive sampling (CS) in a way similar to one-time pad symmetric cipher. This paper tackles the problem of constructing a CS-based symmetric cipher under the key reuse circumstance, i.e., the cipher is resistant to common attacks even a fixed measurement matrix is used multiple times. To this end, we suggest a bi-level protected CS (BLP-CS) model which makes use of the advantage of the non-RIP measurement matrix construction. Specifically, two kinds of artificial basis mismatch techniques are investigated to construct key-related sparsifying bases. It is demonstrated that the encoding process of BLP-CS is simply a random linear projection, which is the same as the basic CS model. However, decoding the linear measurements requires knowledge of both the key-dependent sensing matrix and its sparsifying basis. The proposed model is exemplified by sampling images as a joint data acquisition and protection layer for resource-limited wireless sensors. Simulation results and numerical analyses have justified that the new model can be applied in circumstances where the measurement matrix can be re-used."

To address this challenge, we present KoroT-3E, an AI-based system that creates personalized musical mnemonics to enhance both memory retention and understanding of concepts in CS. KoroT-3E enables users to transform complex concepts into memorable lyrics and compose melodies that suit their musical preferences. We conducted semi-structured interviews (n=12) to investigate why novice learners find it challenging to memorize and understand CS concepts. The findings, combined with constructivist learning theory, established our initial design, which was then refined following consultations with CS education experts. An empirical experiment(n=36) showed that those using KoroT-3E (n=18) significantly outperformed the control group (n=18), with improved memory efficiency, increased motivation, and a positive learning experience. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating multimodal generative AI into CS education to create personalized and interactive learning experiences."

    "title": "Embedding Cryptographic Features in Compressive Sensing",
    "summary": "Compressive sensing (CS) has been widely studied and applied in many fields. Recently, the way to perform secure compressive sensing (SCS) has become a topic of growing interest. The existing works on SCS usually take the sensing matrix as a key and the resultant security level is not evaluated in depth. They can only be considered as a preliminary exploration on SCS, but a concrete and operable encipher model is not given yet. In this paper, we are going to investigate SCS in a systematic way. The relationship between CS and symmetric-key cipher indicates some possible encryption models. To this end, we propose the two-level protection models (TLPM) for SCS which are developed from measurements taking and something else, respectively. It is believed that these models will provide a new point of view and stimulate further research in both CS and cryptography. Specifically, an efficient and secure encryption scheme for parallel compressive sensing (PCS) is designed by embedding a two-layer protection in PCS using chaos. The first layer is undertaken by random permutation on a two-dimensional signal, which is proved to be an acceptable permutation with overwhelming probability. The other layer is to sample the permuted signal column by column with the same chaotic measurement matrix, which satisfies the restricted isometry property of PCS with overwhelming probability. Both the random permutation and the measurement matrix are constructed under the control of a chaotic system. Simulation results show that unlike the general joint compression and encryption schemes in which encryption always leads to the same or a lower compression ratio, the proposed approach of embedding encryption in PCS actually improves the compression performance. Besides, the proposed approach possesses high transmission robustness against additive Gaussian white noise and cropping attack."

    "summary": "Gaussian random matrix (GRM) has been widely used to generate linear measurements in compressed sensing (CS) of natural images. However, there actually exist two disadvantages with GRM in practice. One is that GRM has large memory requirement and high computational complexity, which restrict the applications of CS. Another is that the CS measurements randomly obtained by GRM cannot provide sufficient reconstruction performances. In this paper, a Deep neural network based Sparse Measurement Matrix (DSMM) is learned by the proposed convolutional network to reduce the sampling computational complexity and improve the CS reconstruction performance. Two sub networks are included in the proposed network, which are the sampling sub-network and the reconstruction sub-network. In the sampling sub-network, the sparsity and the normalization are both considered by the limitation of the storage and the computational complexity. In order to improve the CS reconstruction performance, a reconstruction sub-network are introduced to help enhance the sampling sub-network. So by the offline iterative training of the proposed end-to-end network, the DSMM is generated for accurate measurement and excellent reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DSMM outperforms GRM greatly on representative CS reconstruction methods"

Essentially, it aims to find a minimum sufficient representation by striking a trade-off between a compression term and a prediction term , where refers to the mutual information (MI). MI is for the IB for the most part expressed in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which in the regression case corresponds to prediction based on mean squared error (MSE) loss with Gaussian assumption and compression approximated by variational inference. In this paper, we study the IB principle for the regression problem and develop a new way to parameterize the IB with deep neural networks by exploiting favorable properties of the Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence. By doing so, we move away from MSE-based regression and ease estimation by avoiding variational approximations or distributional assumptions. We investigate the improved generalization ability of our proposed CS-IB and demonstrate strong adversarial robustness guarantees. We demonstrate its superior performance on six real-world regression tasks over other popular deep IB approaches. We additionally observe that the solutions discovered by CS-IB always achieve the best trade-off between prediction accuracy and compression ratio in the information plane.

    "summary": "All metaheuristic optimization algorithms require some initialization, and the initialization for such optimizers is usually carried out randomly. However, initialization can have some significant influence on the performance of such algorithms. This paper presents a systematic comparison of 22 different initialization methods on the convergence and accuracy of five optimizers: differential evolution (DE), particle swarm optimization (PSO), cuckoo search (CS), artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA). We have used 19 different test functions with different properties and modalities to compare the possible effects of initialization, population sizes and the numbers of iterations. Rigorous statistical ranking tests indicate that 43.37\\% of the functions using the DE algorithm show significant differences for different initialization methods, while 73.68\\% of the functions using both PSO and CS algorithms are significantly affected by different initialization methods. The simulations show that DE is less sensitive to initialization, while both PSO and CS are more sensitive to initialization. In addition, under the condition of the same maximum number of function evaluations (FEs), the population size can also have a strong effect. Particle swarm optimization usually requires a larger population, while the cuckoo search needs only a small population size. Differential evolution depends more heavily on the number of iterations, a relatively small population with more iterations can lead to better results. Furthermore, ABC is more sensitive to initialization, while such initialization has little effect on GA. Some probability distributions such as the beta distribution, exponential distribution and Rayleigh distribution can usually lead to better performance. The implications of this study and further research topics are also discussed in detail."

This work compares CS to other areas of study with respect to success of students from three underrepresented groups: Women, Black and Hispanic or Latino. Using a data-driven approach, we show that trends of success over the years for underrepresented groups in CS are lagging behind other disciplines. Completion of CS programs by Black students in particular shows an alarming regression in the years 2011 through 2019. This national level decline is most concentrated in the Southeast of the United States and seems to be driven mostly by a small number of institutes that produce a large number of graduates. We strongly believe that more data-driven studies in this area are necessary to make progress towards a more equitable and inclusive CS community. Without an understanding of underlying dynamics, policy makers and practitioners will be unable to make informed decisions about how and where to allocate resources to address the problem."

Firstly, we introduce a sparse, structured CS matrix and we analytically show that it allows accurate reconstruction of bidimensional spatially sparse signals, such as those occurring in several surveillance application. Secondly, we analytically evaluate the energy and bandwidth consumption of our CS scheme when it is applied to data acquisition in a WSN. Numerical results demonstrate that our CS scheme achieves significant energy and bandwidth savings wrt state-of-the-art approaches when employed for sensing a spatially sparse field by means of a WSN."

    "title": "An Efficient Method for Robust Projection Matrix Design",
    "summary": "Our objective is to efficiently design a robust projection matrix for the Compressive Sensing (CS) systems when applied to the signals that are not exactly sparse. The optimal projection matrix is obtained by mainly minimizing the average coherence of the equivalent dictionary. In order to drop the requirement of the sparse representation error (SRE) for a set of training data as in [15] [16], we introduce a novel penalty function independent of a particular SRE matrix. Without requiring of training data, we can efficiently design the robust projection matrix and apply it for most of CS systems, like a CS system for image processing with a conventional wavelet dictionary in which the SRE matrix is generally not available. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate with natural images that under similar compression rate, a CS system with a learned dictionary in high dimensions outperforms the one in low dimensions in terms of reconstruction accuracy. This together with the fact that our proposed method can efficiently work in high dimension suggests that a CS system can be potentially implemented beyond the small patches in sparsity-based image processing."

    "summary": "A new reconstruction method of complex-valued fractional Brownian motion (CV-fBm) field based on Compressive Sampling (CS) is proposed. The decay property of Fourier coefficients magnitude of the fBm signals/ fields indicates that fBms are compressible. Therefore, a few numbers of samples will be sufficient for a CS based method to reconstruct the full field. The effectiveness of the proposed method is showed by simulating, random sampling, and reconstructing CV-fBm fields. Performance evaluation shows advantages of the proposed method over boxcar filtering and thin plate methods. It is also found that the reconstruction performance depends on both of the fBm's Hurst parameter and the number of samples, which in fact is consistent with the CS reconstruction theory. In contrast to other fBm or fractal interpolation methods, the proposed CS based method does not require the knowledge of fractal parameters in the reconstruction process; the inherent sparsity is just sufficient for the CS to do the reconstruction. Potential applicability of the proposed method in weak gravitational lensing survey, particularly for interpolating non-smooth PSF (Point Spread Function) distribution representing distortion by a turbulent field is also discussed."

When a statistical characterization of the signal is available, Bayesian inference can complement conventional CS methods based on linear programming or greedy algorithms. We perform approximate Bayesian inference using belief propagation (BP) decoding, which represents the CS encoding matrix as a graphical model. Fast computation is obtained by reducing the size of the graphical model with sparse encoding matrices. To decode a length-N signal containing K large coefficients, our CS-BP decoding algorithm uses O(Klog(N)) measurements and O(Nlog^2(N)) computation. Finally, although we focus on a two-state mixture Gaussian model, CS-BP is easily adapted to other signal models."

    "summary": "This paper investigates a new class of carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) protocols that employ deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques, referred to as carrier-sense deep-reinforcement learning multiple access (CS-DLMA). The goal of CS-DLMA is to enable efficient and equitable spectrum sharing among a group of co-located heterogeneous wireless networks. Existing CSMA protocols, such as the medium access control (MAC) of WiFi, are designed for a homogeneous network in which all nodes adopt the same protocol. Such protocols suffer from severe performance degradation in a heterogeneous environment where there are nodes adopting other MAC protocols. CS-DLMA aims to circumvent this problem by making use of DRL. In particular, this paper adopts alpha-fairness as the general objective of CS-DLMA. With alpha-fairness, CS-DLMA can achieve a range of different objectives when coexisting with other MACs by changing the value of alpha. A salient feature of CS-DLMA is that it can achieve these objectives without knowing the coexisting MACs through a learning process based on DRL. The underpinning DRL technique in CS-DLMA is deep Q-network (DQN). However, the conventional DQN algorithms are not suitable for CS-DLMA due to their uniform time-step assumption. In CSMA protocols, time steps are non-uniform in that the time duration required for carrier sensing is smaller than the duration of data transmission. This paper introduces a non-uniform time-step formulation of DQN to address this issue. Our simulation results show that CS-DLMA can achieve the general alpha-fairness objective when coexisting with TDMA, ALOHA, and WiFi protocols by adjusting its own transmission strategy. Interestingly, we also find that CS-DLMA is more Pareto efficient than other CSMA protocols when coexisting with WiFi."

However, if at least one language is morphologically rich, a large number of words can be composed of morphemes from more than one language (intra-word CS). In this paper, we extend the language identification task to the subword-level, such that it includes splitting mixed words while tagging each part with a language ID. We further propose a model for this task, which is based on a segmental recurrent neural network. In experiments on a new Spanish--Wixarika dataset and on an adapted German--Turkish dataset, our proposed model performs slightly better than or roughly on par with our best baseline, respectively. Considering only mixed words, however, it strongly outperforms all baselines."

In this work, we ask the following question: given the triplet that defines the CS problem size, what are the deterministic limits on the performance of the best CS matrix in ? We select Restricted Isometry as the performance metric. We derive two deterministic converse bounds and one deterministic achievable bound on the Restricted Isometry for matrices in in terms of , and . The first converse bound (structural bound) is derived by exploiting the intricate relationships between the singular values of sub-matrices and the complete matrix. The second converse bound (packing bound) and the achievable bound (covering bound) are derived by recognizing the equivalence of CS matrices to codes on Grassmannian spaces. Simulations reveal that random Gaussian provide far from optimal performance. The derivation of the three bounds offers several new geometric insights that relate optimal CS matrices to equi-angular tight frames, the Welch bound, codes on Grassmannian spaces, and the Generalized Pythagorean Theorem (GPT)."

Strengthening cybersecurity culture (CSC) is vital in safety-critical industries, yet empirical research in real-world industrial setttings is scarce. This paper addresses this gap through a pilot mixed-methods CSC assessment in a global safety-critical organisation. We examined employees' CS knowledge, attitudes, behaviours, and organisational factors shaping them. A survey and semi-structured interviews were conducted at a global organisation in safety-critical industries, across two countries chosen for contrasting phishing simulation performance: Country 1 stronger, Country 2 weaker. In Country 1, 258 employees were invited (67%), in Country 2, 113 were invited (30%). Interviews included 20 and 10 participants respectively. Overall CSC profiles were similar but revealed distinct challenges. Both showed strong phishing awareness and prioritised CS, yet most viewed phishing as the main risk and lacked clarity on handling other incidents. Line managers were default contacts, but follow-up on reported concerns was unclear. Participants emphasized aligning CS expectations with job relevance and workflows. Key contributors to differences emerged: Country 1 had external employees with limited access to CS training and policies, highlighting monitoring gaps. In Country 2, low survey response stemmed from a \"no-link in email\" policy. While this policy may have boosted phishing performance, it also underscored inconsistencies in CS practices. Findings show that resilient CSC requires leadership involvement, targeted communication, tailored measures, policy-practice alignment, and regular assessments. Embedding these into strategy complements technical defences and strengthens sustainable CS in safety-critical settings."

Continual segmentation (CS) is a potential technique to solve this issue, but a significant obstacle is the intractable balance between previous domains (stability) and new domains (plasticity) during CS. Furthermore, how to utilize two kinds of features of SAM, images and prompts, in an efficient and effective CS manner remains a significant hurdle. In this work, we propose a novel CS method, termed SAMCL, to address these challenges. It is the first study to empower SAM with the CS ability across dynamic domains. SAMCL decouples stability and plasticity during CS by two components: and . Specifically, SAMCL leverages individual to effectively and efficiently learn new relationships between images and prompts in each domain. selects the appropriate module during testing, based on the inherent ability of SAM to distinguish between different domains. These two components enable SAMCL to realize a task-agnostic method without any interference across different domains. Experimental results demonstrate that SAMCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an exceptionally low average forgetting of just %, along with at least a % improvement in transferring to unseen domains. Moreover, the tunable parameter consumption in AugModule is about MB, marking at least a % reduction compared to other fine-tuning methods."

In order to better understand computational science, this paper uses quantitative evidence (from 59 CS projects in Github) to check 13 published beliefs about CS. These beliefs reflect on (a) the nature of scientific challenges; (b) the implications of limitations of computer hardware; and (c) the cultural environment of scientific software development. What we found was, using this new data from Github, only a minority of those older beliefs can be endorsed. More than half of the pre-existing beliefs are dubious, which leads us to conclude that the nature of CS software development is changing.

This motivates research into slot-filling methods that operate with limited amounts of labelled data. Moreover, the majority of current work on ToD is based solely on text as the input modality, neglecting the additional challenges of imperfect automatic speech recognition (ASR) when working with spoken language. In this work, we propose a Knowledge-Aware Audio-Grounded generative slot-filling framework, termed KA2G, that focuses on few-shot and zero-shot slot filling for ToD with speech input. KA2G achieves robust and data-efficient slot filling for speech-based ToD by 1) framing it as a text generation task, 2) grounding text generation additionally in the audio modality, and 3) conditioning on available external knowledge (e.g. a predefined list of possible slot values). We show that combining both modalities within the KA2G framework improves the robustness against ASR errors. Further, the knowledge-aware slot-value generator in KA2G, implemented via a pointer generator mechanism, particularly benefits few-shot and zero-shot learning. Experiments, conducted on the standard speech-based single-turn SLURP dataset and a multi-turn dataset extracted from a commercial ToD system, display strong and consistent gains over prior work, especially in few-shot and zero-shot setups."

In this work, we present novel features, termed dense center-symmetric local binary patterns (CS-LBP) and pyramid center-symmetric local binary/ternary patterns (CS-LBP/LTP), for pedestrian detection. The standard LBP proposed by Ojala et al. c4 mainly captures the texture information. The proposed CS-LBP feature, in contrast, captures the gradient information and some texture information. Moreover, the proposed dense CS-LBP and the pyramid CS-LBP/LTP are easy to implement and computationally efficient, which is desirable for real-time applications. Experiments on the INRIA pedestrian dataset show that the dense CS-LBP feature with linear supporct vector machines (SVMs) is comparable with the histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) feature with linear SVMs, and the pyramid CS-LBP/LTP features outperform both HOG features with linear SVMs and the start-of-the-art pyramid HOG (PHOG) feature with the histogram intersection kernel SVMs. We also demonstrate that the combination of our pyramid CS-LBP feature and the PHOG feature could significantly improve the detection performance-producing state-of-the-art accuracy on the INRIA pedestrian dataset."

In this paper, we perform a generalization analysis of a state-of-the-art ADMM-based unfolding network, which jointly learns a decoder for CS and a sparsifying redundant analysis operator. To this end, we first impose a structural constraint on the learnable sparsifier, which parametrizes the network's hypothesis class. For the latter, we estimate its Rademacher complexity. With this estimate in hand, we deliver generalization error bounds -- which scale like the square root of the number of layers -- for the examined network. Finally, the validity of our theory is assessed and numerical comparisons to a state-of-the-art unfolding network are made, on synthetic and real-world datasets.

The BasP allows interpretation as a channel-coding problem, and it guarantees error-free reconstruction with a properly chosen measurement matrix and sufficiently sparse error vectors. In this manuscript, we examine how the BasP performs on a given measurement matrix and develop an algorithm to discover the sparsest vectors for which the BasP fails. The resulting algorithm is a generalization of our previous results on finding the most probable error-patterns degrading performance of a finite size Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) code in the error-floor regime. The BasP fails when its output is different from the actual error-pattern. We design a CS-Instanton Search Algorithm (ISA) generating a sparse vector, called a CS-instanton, such that the BasP fails on the CS-instanton, while the BasP recovery is successful for any modification of the CS-instanton replacing a nonzero element by zero. We also prove that, given a sufficiently dense random input for the error-vector, the CS-ISA converges to an instanton in a small finite number of steps. The performance of the CS-ISA is illustrated on a randomly generated matrix. For this example, the CS-ISA outputs the shortest instanton (error vector) pattern of length 11."

We consider a special case of unlabeled sensing referred to as Unlabeled Ordered Sampling (UOS) where the ordering of the measurements is preserved. We identify a natural duality between this problem and classical Compressed Sensing (CS), where we show that the unknown support (location of nonzero elements) of a sparse signal in CS corresponds to the unknown indices of the measurements in UOS. While in CS it is possible to recover a sparse signal from an under-determined set of linear equations (less equations than the signal dimension), successful recovery in UOS requires taking more samples than the dimension of the signal. Motivated by this duality, we develop a Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) similar to that in CS. We also design a low-complexity Alternating Minimization algorithm that achieves a stable signal recovery under the established RIP. We analyze our proposed algorithm for different signal dimensions and number of measurements theoretically and investigate its performance empirically via simulations. The results are reminiscent of phase-transition similar to that occurring in CS."

Even though OSS often provides ready-to-build packages, subtle differences in local environment setups can lead to build issues, costing students tremendous time and effort in debugging. Despite the prevalence of build issues faced by CS students, there is a lack of studies exploring this topic. To investigate the build issues frequently encountered by CS students and explore methods to help them resolve these issues, we conducted a novel dual-phase study involving 330 build tasks among 55 CS students. Phase I characterized the build issues students faced, their resolution attempts, and the effectiveness of those attempts. Based on these findings, Phase II introduced an intervention method that emphasized key information (e.g., recommended programming language versions) to students. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of our intervention in improving build success rates. Our research will shed light on future directions in related areas, such as CS education on best practices for software builds and enhanced tool support to simplify the build process."

    "summary": "Spam messes up users inbox, consumes resources and spread attacks like DDoS, MiM, Phishing etc., Phishing is a byproduct of email and causes financial loss to users and loss of reputation to financial institutions. In this paper we study the characteristics of phishing and technology used by phishers. In order to counter anti phishing technology, phishers change their mode of operation; therefore continuous evaluation of phishing helps us to combat phishers effectively. We have collected seven hundred thousand spam from a corporate server for a period of 13 months from February 2008 to February 2009. From the collected date, we identified different kinds of phishing scams and mode of their operation. Our observation shows that phishers are dynamic and depend more on social engineering techniques rather than software vulnerabilities. We believe that this study would be useful to develop more efficient anti phishing methodologies."

    "title": "Code-Switching and Syntax: A Large-Scale Experiment",
    "summary": "The theoretical code-switching (CS) literature provides numerous pointwise investigations that aim to explain patterns in CS, i.e. why bilinguals switch language in certain positions in a sentence more often than in others. A resulting consensus is that CS can be explained by the syntax of the contributing languages. There is however no large-scale, multi-language, cross-phenomena experiment that tests this claim. When designing such an experiment, we need to make sure that the system that is predicting where bilinguals tend to switch has access only to syntactic information. We provide such an experiment here. Results show that syntax alone is sufficient for an automatic system to distinguish between sentences in minimal pairs of CS, to the same degree as bilingual humans. Furthermore, the learnt syntactic patterns generalise well to unseen language pairs."

    "title": "Model-Based Compressive Sensing",
    "summary": "Compressive sensing (CS) is an alternative to Shannon/Nyquist sampling for the acquisition of sparse or compressible signals that can be well approximated by just K << N elements from an N-dimensional basis. Instead of taking periodic samples, CS measures inner products with M < N random vectors and then recovers the signal via a sparsity-seeking optimization or greedy algorithm. Standard CS dictates that robust signal recovery is possible from M = O(K log(N/K)) measurements. It is possible to substantially decrease M without sacrificing robustness by leveraging more realistic signal models that go beyond simple sparsity and compressibility by including structural dependencies between the values and locations of the signal coefficients. This paper introduces a model-based CS theory that parallels the conventional theory and provides concrete guidelines on how to create model-based recovery algorithms with provable performance guarantees. A highlight is the introduction of a new class of structured compressible signals along with a new sufficient condition for robust structured compressible signal recovery that we dub the restricted amplification property, which is the natural counterpart to the restricted isometry property of conventional CS. Two examples integrate two relevant signal models - wavelet trees and block sparsity - into two state-of-the-art CS recovery algorithms and prove that they offer robust recovery from just M=O(K) measurements. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the validity and applicability of our new theory and algorithms."

    "summary": "Language models (LMs) show state of the art performance for common sense (CS) question answering, but whether this ability implies a human-level mastery of CS remains an open question. Understanding the limitations and strengths of LMs can help researchers improve these models, potentially by developing novel ways of integrating external CS knowledge. We devise a series of tests and measurements to systematically quantify their performance on different aspects of CS. We propose the use of cloze testing combined with word embeddings to measure the LM's robustness and confidence. Our results show than although language models tend to achieve human-like accuracy, their confidence is subpar. Future work can leverage this information to build more complex systems, such as an ensemble of symbolic and distributed knowledge."

    "summary": "In frequency-division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, 1-bit compressed sensing (CS)-based superimposed channel state information (CSI) feedback has shown many advantages, while still faces many challenges, such as low accuracy of the downlink CSI recovery and large processing delays. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a deep learning (DL) scheme to improve the 1-bit compressed sensing-based superimposed CSI feedback. On the user side, the downlink CSI is compressed with the 1-bit CS technique, superimposed on the uplink user data sequences (UL-US), and then sent back to the base station (BS). At the BS, based on the model-driven approach and assisted by the superimposition-interference cancellation technology, a multi-task detection network is first constructed for detecting both the UL-US and downlink CSI. In particular, this detection network is jointly trained to detect the UL-US and downlink CSI simultaneously, capturing a globally optimized network parameter. Then, with the recovered bits for the downlink CSI, a lightweight reconstruction scheme, which consists of an initial feature extraction of the downlink CSI with the simplified traditional method and a single hidden layer network, is utilized to reconstruct the downlink CSI with low processing delay. Compared with the 1-bit CS-based superimposed CSI feedback scheme, the proposed scheme improves the recovery accuracy of the UL-US and downlink CSI with lower processing delay and possesses robustness against parameter variations."

Our goal is to present a definite figure about the characteristics of spam and spammers. Since spammers change their mode of operation to counter anti spam technology,continues evaluation of the characteristics of spam and spammers technology has become mandatory. These evaluations help us to enhance the existing technology to combat spam effectively. We collected 400 thousand spam mails from a spam trap set up in a corporate mail server for a period of 14 months form January 2006 to February 2007. Spammers use common techniques to spam end users regardless of corporate server and public mail server. So we believe that our spam collection is a sample of world wide spam traffic. Studying the characteristics of this sample helps us to better understand the features of spam and spammers technology. We believe that this analysis could be useful to develop more efficient anti spam techniques."

    "summary": "A new framework of compressive sensing (CS), namely statistical compressive sensing (SCS), that aims at efficiently sampling a collection of signals that follow a statistical distribution and achieving accurate reconstruction on average, is introduced. For signals following a Gaussian distribution, with Gaussian or Bernoulli sensing matrices of O(k) measurements, considerably smaller than the O(k log(N/k)) required by conventional CS, where N is the signal dimension, and with an optimal decoder implemented with linear filtering, significantly faster than the pursuit decoders applied in conventional CS, the error of SCS is shown tightly upper bounded by a constant times the k-best term approximation error, with overwhelming probability. The failure probability is also significantly smaller than that of conventional CS. Stronger yet simpler results further show that for any sensing matrix, the error of Gaussian SCS is upper bounded by a constant times the k-best term approximation with probability one, and the bound constant can be efficiently calculated. For signals following Gaussian mixture models, SCS with a piecewise linear decoder is introduced and shown to produce for real images better results than conventional CS based on sparse models."

Identifying risk markers early is crucial for understanding disease progression and enabling preventive measures. The Danish High Risk and Resilience Study (VIA) focuses on understanding early disease processes, particularly in children with familial high risk (FHR). Understanding structural brain changes associated with these diseases during early stages is essential for effective interventions. The central sulcus (CS) is a prominent brain landmark related to brain regions involved in motor and sensory processing. Analyzing CS morphology can provide valuable insights into neurodevelopmental abnormalities in the FHR group. However, segmenting the central sulcus (CS) presents challenges due to its variability, especially in adolescents. This study introduces two novel approaches to improve CS segmentation: synthetic data generation to model CS variability and self-supervised pre-training with multi-task learning to adapt models to new cohorts. These methods aim to enhance segmentation performance across diverse populations, eliminating the need for extensive preprocessing."

In Fall 2016 we collected Google Scholar citation data for 4,352 tenure-track CS faculty from 173 U.S. universities. The citations are measured by the t10 index, which represents the number of citations received by the 10th highest cited paper of a faculty. To measure the research strength of a CS doctoral program we use 2 groups of citation measures. The first group of measures averages t10 of faculty in a program. Pearson correlation of those measures with the peer assessment of U.S. CS doctoral programs published by the U.S. News in 2014 is as high as 0.890. The second group of measures counts the number of well cited faculty in a program. Pearson correlation of those measures with the peer assessment is as high as 0.909. By combining those two groups of measures using linear regression, we create the Scholar score whose Pearson correlation with the peer assessment is 0.933 and which explains 87.2% of the variance in the peer assessment. Our evaluation shows that the highest 62 ranked CS doctoral programs by the U.S. News peer assessment are much higher correlated with the Scholar score than the next 57 ranked programs, indicating the deficiencies of peer assessment of less-known CS programs. Our results also indicate that university reputation might have a sizeable impact on peer assessment of CS doctoral programs.

    "summary": "Recently, a switch-based hybrid massive MIMO structure that aims to reduce the hardware complexity and power consumption has been proposed as a potential candidate for millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. Exploiting the sparse nature of the mmWave channel, compressive sensing (CS)-based channel estimators have been proposed. When applied to real mmWave channels, the CS-based channel estimators may encounter heavy computational burden due to the high dimensionality of the basis. Meanwhile, knowledge about the response of the antenna array, which is needed for constructing the basis of the CS estimators, may not be perfect due to array uncertainties such as phase mismatch among array elements. This can result in the loss of sparse representation and hence the degraded performance of the CS estimator. In this paper, we propose a novel matrix completion (MC)-based low-complexity channel estimator. The proposed scheme is compatible with switch-based hybrid structures, does not need to specify a basis, and can avoid the basis mismatch issue. Compared with the existing CS-based estimator, the proposed basis-free scheme is immune to array response mismatch and exhibits a significantly lower complexity."

By using Katz' character sum estimation, we are able to design a deterministic procedure to select rows from a Fourier matrix to form a good compressed sensing matrix for sparse recovery. The sparsity bound in our construction is similar to that of binary CS matrices constructed by DeVore which greatly improves previous results for CS matrices from Fourier matrices. Our approach also provides more flexibilities in terms of the dimension of CS matrices. As a consequence, our construction yields an approximately mutually unbiased bases from Fourier matrices which is of particular interest to quantum information theory. This paper also contains a useful improvement to Katz' character sum estimation for quadratic extensions, with an elementary and transparent proof. Some numerical examples are included."

Perfect secrecy can also be achieved by normalizing the CS measurement vector. However, these findings are established on real measurements while digital devices can only store measurements at a finite precision. Based on the distribution of measurements of natural images sensed by structurally random ensemble, a joint quantization and diffusion approach is proposed for these real-valued measurements. In this way, a nonlinear cryptographic diffusion is intrinsically imposed on the CS process and the overall security level is thus enhanced. Security analyses show that the proposed scheme is able to resist known-plaintext attack while the original CS scheme without quantization cannot. Experimental results demonstrate that the reconstruction quality of our scheme is comparable to that of the original one."

This causes the smoothness of recovered images and lack of structure information, especially at a low measurement rate. To overcome this drawback, in this paper, we propose perceptual CS to obtain high-level structured recovery. Our task no longer focuses on pixel level. Instead, we work to make a better visual effect. In detail, we employ perceptual loss, defined on feature level, to enhance the structure information of the recovered images. Experiments show that our method achieves better visual results with stronger structure information than existing CS methods at the same measurement rate."

    "summary": "The multiple measurement vector (MMV) problem addresses the identification of unknown input vectors that share common sparse support. Even though MMV problems had been traditionally addressed within the context of sensor array signal processing, the recent trend is to apply compressive sensing (CS) due to its capability to estimate sparse support even with an insufficient number of snapshots, in which case classical array signal processing fails. However, CS guarantees the accurate recovery in a probabilistic manner, which often shows inferior performance in the regime where the traditional array signal processing approaches succeed. The apparent dichotomy between the probabilistic CS and deterministic sensor array signal processing have not been fully understood. The main contribution of the present article is a unified approach that unveils a missing link between CS and array signal processing. The new algorithm, which we call compressive MUSIC , identifies the parts of support using CS, after which the remaining supports are estimated using a novel generalized MUSIC criterion. Using a large system MMV model, we show that our compressive MUSIC requires a smaller number of sensor elements for accurate support recovery than the existing CS methods and can approach the optimal -bound with finite number of snapshots."

Third, generating novel reasons for explaining the against common sense statement. Out of the three subtasks, this paper reports the system description of subtask A and subtask B. This paper proposes a model based on transformer neural network architecture for addressing the subtasks. The novelty in work lies in the architecture design, which handles the logical implication of contradicting statements and simultaneous information extraction from both sentences. We use a parallel instance of transformers, which is responsible for a boost in the performance. We achieved an accuracy of 94.8% in subtask A and 89% in subtask B on the test set."

In this paper, we propose a Code-Switched Large Language Model (CS-LLM) to enhance the code-switched text-to-speech synthesis (CS TTS) capability in LLMs with only monolingual corpora. Specifically, we begin by enhancing the multilingual speech processing ability of LLMs through multilingual speech recognition and synthesis tasks. Then, we develop an effective code-switched (CS) data construction strategy that splits and concatenates words from different monolingual speech corpora to equip LLMs with improved CS TTS ability. Experiments show that our approach outperforms baselines in CS TTS in terms of naturalness, speaker consistency and similarity even with limited data. Additionally, the constructed CS data further improves multilingual speech synthesis and recognition."

As such, having a reliable measure for evaluating the discrepancy of both marginal and conditional distributions is crucial. We introduce Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence to the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). The CS divergence offers a theoretically tighter generalization error bound than the popular Kullback-Leibler divergence. This holds for the general case of supervised learning, including multi-class classification and regression. Furthermore, we illustrate that the CS divergence enables a simple estimator on the discrepancy of both marginal and conditional distributions between source and target domains in the representation space, without requiring any distributional assumptions. We provide multiple examples to illustrate how the CS divergence can be conveniently used in both distance metric- or adversarial training-based UDA frameworks, resulting in compelling performance."

Three different signaling techniques are proposed and analyzed based on the statistics of the noise added to CS after propagation along the nonlinear optical fiber. The proposed methods are compared in terms of error performance, distance reach, and complexity. Furthermore, the effect of chromatic dispersion on the data rate and noise in nonlinear spectral domain is investigated. It is demonstrated that, for a given sequence of CS symbols, an optimal bandwidth (or symbol rate) can be determined so that the temporal duration of the propagated signal at the end of the fiber is minimized. In effect, the required guard interval between the subsequently transmitted data packets in time is minimized and the effective data rate is significantly enhanced. Moreover, by selecting the proper signaling method and design criteria a reach distance of 7100 km is reported by only singling on the CS at a rate of 9.6 Gbps."

Automatic CS recognition can help communications between the deaf people and others. Due to the asynchronous nature of lips and hand movements, fusion of them in automatic CS recognition is a challenging problem. In this work, we propose a novel re-synchronization procedure for multi-modal fusion, which aligns the hand features with lips feature. It is realized by delaying hand position and hand shape with their optimal hand preceding time which is derived by investigating the temporal organizations of hand position and hand shape movements in CS. This re-synchronization procedure is incorporated into a practical continuous CS recognition system that combines convolutional neural network (CNN) with multi-stream hidden markov model (MSHMM). A significant improvement of about 4.6\\% has been achieved retaining 76.6\\% CS phoneme recognition correctness compared with the state-of-the-art architecture (72.04\\%), which did not take into account the asynchrony of multi-modal fusion in CS.

The proposed scheme is based on exploiting the benefits of CS and localization to reduce mmWave beamforming (BF) complexity and enhance its performance compared with conventional mmWave analog BF techniques. CS theory is used to exploit the sparse nature of the mmWave propagation channel to estimate both the angle of departures (AoDs) and the angle of arrivals (AoAs) of the mmWave channel, and knowing the node location effectively reduces the number of BF vectors required for constructing the sensing matrix. Hence, a high accurate mmWave BF with a low set-up time can be obtained. Simulation analysis confirms the high effectiveness of the proposed mmWave BF technique compared to the conventional exhaustive search BF and the CS based BF without localization using random measurements"

The signals are sparse in some transform domain referred to as the sparsity basis. For a single spatial signal, the solution is provided by Compressed Sensing (CS). The question that we address is, for a sequence of sparse signals, can we do better than CS, if (a) the sparsity pattern of the signal's transform coefficients' vector changes slowly over time, and (b) a simple prior model on the temporal dynamics of its current non-zero elements is available. The overall idea of our solution is to use CS to estimate the support set of the initial signal's transform vector. At future times, run a reduced order Kalman filter with the currently estimated support and estimate new additions to the support set by applying CS to the Kalman innovations or filtering error (whenever it is \"large\")."

Intrinsic sparsity of distribution of clutter and target energy on spatial-frequency plane was exploited from the viewpoint of compressed sensing. The original sample data and distribution of target and clutter energy was connected by a ill-posed linear algebraic equation and popular optimization method could be utilized to search for its solution with sparse characteristic. Several new filtering algorithm acting on this solution were designed to clean clutter component on spatial-frequency plane effectively for detecting invisible targets buried in clutter. The method above is called CS-STAP in general. CS-STAP showed their advantage compared with conventional STAP technique, such as SMI, in two ways: Firstly, the resolution of CS-STAP on estimation for distribution of clutter and target energy is ultra-high such that clutter energy might be annihilated almost completely by carefully tuned filter. Output SCR of CS-STAP algorithms is far superior to the requirement of detection; Secondly, a much smaller size of training sample support compared with SMI method is requested for CS-STAP method. Even with only one snapshot (from target range cell) could CS-STAP method be able to reveal the existence of target clearly. CS-STAP method display its great potential to be used in heterogeneous situation. Experimental result on dataset from mountaintop program has provided the evidence for our assertion on CS-STAP."

Some approaches based on SVD are most acceptable to detect copy-move forgery but some copy-move forgery detection approaches can not produce satisfactory detection results. Sometimes these approaches may even produce error results. According to our observation, detection result produced using SVD depend highly on those parameters whose values are often determined with experiences. These values are only applicable to a few images, which limit their application. To solve this problem, a novel approach named as copy-move forgery detection using Cuckoo search algorithm (CMFD-CS) is proposed in this paper. CMFD-CS integrates the CS algorithm into SVD.

The new approach consists of combining the CS with the Nelder-Mead method. More precisely, instead of using single solutions as nests for the CS, we use the concept of a simplex which is used in the Nelder-Mead algorithm. This makes it possible to use the flip operation introduces in the Nelder-Mead algorithm instead of the Levy flight which is a standard part of the CS. In this way, the hybridized algorithm becomes more robust and less sensitive to parameter tuning which exists in CS. The goal of our work was to optimize the performance of multi-cell solar systems. Although the underlying problem consists of the minimization of a function of a relatively small number of parameters, the difficulty comes from the fact that the evaluation of the function is complex and only a small number of evaluations is possible. In our test, we show that the new method has a better performance when compared to similar but more compex hybridizations of Nelder-Mead algorithm using genetic algorithms or particle swarm optimization on standard benchmark functions. Finally, we show that the new method outperforms some standard meta-heuristics for the problem of interest."

To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even 7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro.

We aim to investigate the exact nature of the eruptive phenomenon that the star has been experiencing since 2018. Methods. We use public-domain archival photometry to characterise the quiescent phase in order to establish major physical parameters of the progenitor. Then, we use our and public-domain optical and infrared photometry and spectroscopy to study the outburst. Results. Gaia20bdk is a member of the Sharpless 2-301 star-forming region, at a distance of 3.3 kpc. The progenitor is a rather massive 2.7 solar mass, G7-type Class I young star having an effective temperature of 5300 K and bolometric luminosity of 11 solar luminosities. The optical and infrared photometric and spectroscopic data obtained during the outburst show a variety of signatures commonly found in classical FUors. Our disc modelling results in a bolometric luminosity of 100-200 solar luminosities and mass accretion rate of 1-2e-5 solar masses per year, also confirming the object's FUor classification. Further monitoring is necessary to track the light changes, accretion rate and spectral variations, as well as to understood the mechanisms behind the disc flickering."

    "title": "Scan-based Compressed Terahertz Imaging and Real-Time Reconstruction via the Complex-valued Fast Block Sparse Bayesian Learning Algorithm",
    "summary": "Compressed Sensing based Terahertz imaging (CS-THz) is a computational imaging technique. It uses only one THz receiver to accumulate the random modulated image measurements where the original THz image is reconstruct from these measurements using compressed sensing solvers. The advantage of the CS-THz is its reduced acquisition time compared with the raster scan mode. However, when it applied to large-scale two-dimensional (2D) imaging, the increased dimension resulted in both high computational complexity and excessive memory usage. In this paper, we introduced a novel CS-based THz imaging system that progressively compressed the THz image column by column. Therefore, the CS-THz system could be simplified with a much smaller sized modulator and reduced dimension. In order to utilize the block structure and the correlation of adjacent columns of the THz image, a complex-valued block sparse Bayesian learning algorithm was proposed. We conducted systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art CS algorithms under the scan based CS-THz architecture. The compression ratios and the choices of the sensing matrices were analyzed in detail using both synthetic and real-life THz images. Simulation results showed that both the scan based architecture and the proposed recovery algorithm were superior and efficient for large scale CS-THz applications."

    "title": "Robust Compressed Sensing Under Matrix Uncertainties",
    "summary": "Compressed sensing (CS) shows that a signal having a sparse or compressible representation can be recovered from a small set of linear measurements. In classical CS theory, the sampling matrix and representation matrix are assumed to be known exactly in advance. However, uncertainties exist due to sampling distortion, finite grids of the parameter space of dictionary, etc. In this paper, we take a generalized sparse signal model, which simultaneously considers the sampling and representation matrix uncertainties. Based on the new signal model, a new optimization model for robust sparse signal reconstruction is proposed. This optimization model can be deduced with stochastic robust approximation analysis. Both convex relaxation and greedy algorithms are used to solve the optimization problem. For the convex relaxation method, a sufficient condition for recovery by convex relaxation is given; For the greedy algorithm, it is realized by the introduction of a pre-processing of the sensing matrix and the measurements. In numerical experiments, both simulated data and real-life ECG data based results show that the proposed method has a better performance than the current methods."

    "title": "Graded quantization for multiple description coding of compressive measurements",
    "summary": "Compressed sensing (CS) is an emerging paradigm for acquisition of compressed representations of a sparse signal. Its low complexity is appealing for resource-constrained scenarios like sensor networks. However, such scenarios are often coupled with unreliable communication channels and providing robust transmission of the acquired data to a receiver is an issue. Multiple description coding (MDC) effectively combats channel losses for systems without feedback, thus raising the interest in developing MDC methods explicitly designed for the CS framework, and exploiting its properties. We propose a method called Graded Quantization (CS-GQ) that leverages the democratic property of compressive measurements to effectively implement MDC, and we provide methods to optimize its performance. A novel decoding algorithm based on the alternating directions method of multipliers is derived to reconstruct signals from a limited number of received descriptions. Simulations are performed to assess the performance of CS-GQ against other methods in presence of packet losses. The proposed method is successful at providing robust coding of CS measurements and outperforms other schemes for the considered test metrics."

To answer this question, we evaluate an attention-based encoder-decoder with a subword-level encoder and a character-level decoder on four language pairs--En-Cs, En-De, En-Ru and En-Fi-- using the parallel corpora from WMT'15. Our experiments show that the models with a character-level decoder outperform the ones with a subword-level decoder on all of the four language pairs. Furthermore, the ensembles of neural models with a character-level decoder outperform the state-of-the-art non-neural machine translation systems on En-Cs, En-De and En-Fi and perform comparably on En-Ru."

    "title": "Certifiable Safe RLHF: Fixed-Penalty Constraint Optimization for Safer Language Models",
    "summary": "Ensuring safety is a foundational requirement for large language models (LLMs). Achieving an appropriate balance between enhancing the utility of model outputs and mitigating their potential for harm is a complex and persistent challenge. Contemporary approaches frequently formalize this problem within the framework of Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) and employ established CMDP optimization techniques. However, these methods exhibit two notable limitations. First, their reliance on reward and cost functions renders performance highly sensitive to the underlying scoring mechanism, which must capture semantic meaning rather than being triggered by superficial keywords. Second, CMDP-based training entails tuning dual-variable, a process that is both computationally expensive and does not provide any provable safety guarantee for a fixed dual variable that can be exploitable through adversarial jailbreaks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Certifiable Safe-RLHF (CS-RLHF) that introduces a cost model trained on a large-scale corpus to assign semantically grounded safety scores. In contrast to the lagrangian-based approach, CS-RLHF adopts a rectified penalty-based formulation. This design draws on the theory of exact penalty functions in constrained optimization, wherein constraint satisfaction is enforced directly through a suitably chosen penalty term. With an appropriately scaled penalty, feasibility of the safety constraints can be guaranteed at the optimizer, eliminating the need for dual-variable updates. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CS-RLHF outperforms state-of-the-art LLM model responses rendering at-least 5 times efficient against nominal and jail-breaking prompts"

Nevertheless, practical issues with the sampling and reconstruction algorithms prevent further proliferation of CS in real world domains, especially among heterogeneous ubiquitous devices. Deep learning (DL) naturally complements CS for adapting the sampling matrix, reconstructing the signal, and learning form the compressed samples. While the CS-DL integration has received substantial research interest recently, it has not yet been thoroughly surveyed, nor has the light been shed on practical issues towards bringing the CS-DL to real world implementations in the ubicomp domain. In this paper we identify main possible ways in which CS and DL can interplay, extract key ideas for making CS-DL efficient, identify major trends in CS-DL research space, and derive guidelines for future evolution of CS-DL within the ubicomp domain."

Yannakakis provides a quasi-polynomial CS-separator, i.e. of size , and addresses the problem of finding a polynomial CS-separator. This question is still open even for perfect graphs. We show that a polynomial CS-separator almost surely exists for random graphs. Besides, if H is a split graph (i.e. has a vertex-partition into a clique and a stable set) then there exists a constant for which we find a CS-separator on the class of H-free graphs. This generalizes a result of Yannakakis on comparability graphs. We also provide a CS-separator on the class of graphs without induced path of length k and its complement. Observe that on one side, is of order resulting from Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, and on the other side, is exponential. One of the main reason why Yannakakis' CL-IS problem is fascinating is that it admits equivalent formulations. Our main result in this respect is to show that a polynomial CS-separator is equivalent to the polynomial Alon-Saks-Seymour Conjecture, asserting that if a graph has an edge-partition into k complete bipartite graphs, then its chromatic number is polynomially bounded in terms of k. We also show that the classical approach to the stubborn problem (arising in CSP) which consists in covering the set of all solutions by instances of 2-SAT is again equivalent to the existence of a polynomial CS-separator."

In this work, we propose a DUN called low-rank CS network (LR-CSNet) for natural image CS. Real-world image patches are often well-represented by low-rank approximations. LR-CSNet exploits this property by adding a low-rank prior to the CS optimization task. We derive a corresponding iterative optimization procedure using variable splitting, which is then translated to a new DUN architecture. The architecture uses low-rank generation modules (LRGMs), which learn low-rank matrix factorizations, as well as gradient descent and proximal mappings (GDPMs), which are proposed to extract high-frequency features to refine image details. In addition, the deep features generated at each reconstruction stage in the DUN are transferred between stages to boost the performance. Our extensive experiments on three widely considered datasets demonstrate the promising performance of LR-CSNet compared to state-of-the-art methods in natural image CS."

Recent studies consistently highlight students' (mis)use of LLMs can hinder learning outcomes. This work aims to teach students how to effectively prompt LLMs to improve their learning. We first proposed pedagogical prompting, a theoretically-grounded new concept to elicit learning-oriented responses from LLMs. To move from concept design to a proof-of-concept learning intervention in real educational settings, we selected early undergraduate CS education (CS1/CS2) as the example context. We began with a formative survey study with instructors (N=36) teaching early-stage undergraduate-level CS courses to inform the instructional design based on classroom needs. Based on their insights, we designed and developed a learning intervention through an interactive system with scenario-based instruction to train pedagogical prompting skills. Finally, we evaluated its instructional effectiveness through a user study with CS novice students (N=22) using pre/post-tests. Through mixed methods analyses, our results indicate significant improvements in learners' LLM-based pedagogical help-seeking skills, along with positive attitudes toward the system and increased willingness to use pedagogical prompts in the future. Our contributions include (1) a theoretical framework of pedagogical prompting; (2) empirical insights into current instructor attitudes toward pedagogical prompting; and (3) a learning intervention design with an interactive learning tool and scenario-based instruction leading to promising results on teaching LLM-based help-seeking. Our approach is scalable for broader implementation in classrooms and has the potential to be integrated into tools like ChatGPT as an on-boarding experience to encourage learning-oriented use of generative AI."

It incorporates speech translation (ST) tasks into LAE and utilizes ST to learn the contextual information between different languages. It introduces a task-based mixture of expert modules, employing separate feed-forward networks for the ASR and ST tasks. Experimental results on the ASRU 2019 Mandarin-English CS challenge dataset demonstrate that, compared to the LAE-based CTC, the LAE-ST-MoE model achieves a 9.26% mix error reduction on the CS test with the same decoding parameter. Moreover, the well-trained LAE-ST-MoE model can perform ST tasks from CS speech to Mandarin or English text."

Yet, no existing work has studied the potential of Wikidata for commonsense reasoning. This paper investigates whether Wikidata con-tains commonsense knowledge which is complementary to existing commonsense sources. Starting from a definition of common sense, we devise three guiding principles, and apply them to generate a commonsense subgraph of Wikidata (Wikidata-CS). Within our approach, we map the relations of Wikidata to ConceptNet, which we also leverage to integrate Wikidata-CS into an existing consolidated commonsense graph. Our experiments reveal that: 1) albeit Wikidata-CS represents a small portion of Wikidata, it is an indicator that Wikidata contains relevant commonsense knowledge, which can be mapped to 15 ConceptNet relations; 2) the overlap between Wikidata-CS and other commonsense sources is low, motivating the value of knowledge integration; 3) Wikidata-CS has been evolving over time at a slightly slower rate compared to the overall Wikidata, indicating a possible lack of focus on commonsense knowledge. Based on these findings, we propose three recommended actions to improve the coverage and quality of Wikidata-CS further."

The number of dominant MPCs that any CS algorithm needs to estimate in order to accurately represent the channel is characterized. This number relates to a Compressibility Index (CI) of the channel that depends on the fourth moment of the MPC amplitude distribution. A connection between the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of any CS estimation algorithm and the MPC amplitude distribution fourth moment is revealed that shows a smaller number of MPCs is needed to well-estimate channels when these components have large fourth moment amplitude gains. The analytical results are validated via simulations for channels with lognormal MPCs such as the NYU mmWave channel model. These simulations show that when the MPC amplitude distribution has a high fourth moment, the well known CS algorithm of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit performs almost identically to the Basis Pursuit De-Noising algorithm with a much lower computational cost."

Block-based CS is a lightweight CS approach that is mostly suitable for processing very high-dimensional images and videos: it operates on local patches, employs a low-complexity reconstruction operator and requires significantly less memory to store the sensing matrix. In this paper we present a deep learning approach for block-based CS, in which a fully-connected network performs both the block-based linear sensing and non-linear reconstruction stages. During the training phase, the sensing matrix and the non-linear reconstruction operator are jointly optimized, and the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art both in terms of reconstruction quality and computation time. For example, at a 25% sensing rate the average PSNR advantage is 0.77dB and computation time is over 200-times faster."

Each pixel in the acquired frame is a noisy linear mapping of the corresponding pixels in the frames that are combined together. While the problem can be cast as a CS problem, due to the very special structure of the sensing matrix, standard CS theory cannot be employed to study such systems. In this paper, a compression-based framework is employed for theoretical analysis of snapshot CS systems. It is shown that this framework leads to two novel, computationally-efficient and theoretically-analyzable compression-based recovery algorithms. The proposed methods are iterative and employ compression codes to define and impose the structure of the desired signal. Theoretical convergence guarantees are derived for both algorithms. In the simulations, it is shown that, in the cases of both noise-free and noisy measurements, combining the proposed algorithms with a customized video compression code, designed to exploit nonlocal structures of video frames, significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance."

Generally, sampling algorithms do not exploit context-specific independence (CSI) properties of probability distributions. We introduce context-specific likelihood weighting (CS-LW), a new sampling methodology, which besides exploiting the classical conditional independence properties, also exploits CSI properties. Unlike the standard likelihood weighting, CS-LW is based on partial assignments of random variables and requires fewer samples for convergence due to the sampling variance reduction. Furthermore, the speed of generating samples increases. Our novel notion of contextual assignments theoretically justifies CS-LW. We empirically show that CS-LW is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms for approximate inference in the presence of a significant amount of CSIs."

Most of current CS recovery algorithms are originally designed for one-dimensional (1D) signal, while many practical signals are two-dimensional (2D). By utilizing 2D separable sampling, 2D signal recovery problem can be converted into 1D signal recovery problem so that ordinary 1D recovery algorithms, e.g. orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), can be applied directly. However, even with 2D separable sampling, the memory usage and complexity at the decoder is still high. This paper develops a novel recovery algorithm called 2D-OMP, which is an extension of 1D-OMP. In the 2D-OMP, each atom in the dictionary is a matrix. At each iteration, the decoder projects the sample matrix onto 2D atoms to select the best matched atom, and then renews the weights for all the already selected atoms via the least squares. We show that 2D-OMP is in fact equivalent to 1D-OMP, but it reduces recovery complexity and memory usage significantly. What's more important, by utilizing the same methodology used in this paper, one can even obtain higher dimensional OMP (say 3D-OMP, etc.) with ease."

We use a language model as PUCT's policy and a combination of the emotion classifier and the discriminator as its value function. To decode the next token in a piece of music, we sample from the distribution of node visits created during the search. We evaluate the quality of the generated samples with respect to human-composed pieces using a set of objective metrics computed directly from the generated samples. We also perform a user study to evaluate how human subjects perceive the generated samples' quality and emotion. We compare PUCT against Stochastic Bi-Objective Beam Search (SBBS) and Conditional Sampling (CS). Results suggest that PUCT outperforms SBBS and CS in almost all metrics of music quality and emotion."

In this work the MLF theory was used to develop systems for Matrix Language Identity (MLID) determination. The MLID of English/Mandarin and English/Spanish CS text and speech was compared to acoustic language identity (LID), which is a typical way to identify a language in monolingual utterances. MLID predictors from audio show higher correlation with the textual principles than LID in all cases while also outperforming LID in an MLID recognition task based on F1 macro (60%) and correlation score (0.38).

A larger target model then reviews this draft to align with its output, and any acceptance by the target model results in a reduction of the number of the target model runs, ultimately improving efficiency. However, the drafting process in speculative decoding includes slow autoregressive generation and allocates equal time to generating tokens, irrespective of their importance. These inefficiencies collectively contribute to the suboptimal performance of speculative decoding. To further improve LLM inference, we introduce Cascade Speculative Drafting (CS Drafting), a speculative execution algorithm that incorporates two types of cascades. The Vertical Cascade eliminates autoregressive generation from neural models, while the Horizontal Cascade optimizes time allocation in drafting for improved efficiency. Combining both cascades, CS Drafting achieves greater speedup compared to the baselines in our experiments, while preserving the same output distribution as the target model."

We further propose to change the Mandarin output target of the encoder to Pinyin for faster encoder training and introduce the Pinyin-to-Mandarin decoder to learn contextualized information. Moreover, we use word embedding label smoothing to regularize the decoder with contextualized information and projection matrix regularization to bridge that gap between the encoder and decoder.

Here, we clarify and explore the connection between CS techniques and least squares (LS) and regularized least squares (RLS) methods commonly used in machine learning and data analysis. By formal identification of LS and RLS \"shadows\" completely analogous to those in CS -- namely, point estimators calculated from the empirical frequencies of single measurements -- we show that both RLS and CS can be viewed as regularizers for the underdetermined regime, replacing the pseudoinverse with invertible alternatives. Through numerical simulations, we evaluate RLS and CS from three distinct angles: the tradeoff in bias and variance, mismatch between the expected and actual measurement distributions, and the interplay between the number of measurements and number of shots per measurement. Compared to CS, RLS attains lower variance at the expense of bias, is robust to distribution mismatch, and is more sensitive to the number of shots for a fixed number of state copies -- differences that can be understood from the distinct approaches taken to regularization. Conceptually, our integration of LS, RLS, and CS under a unifying \"shadow\" umbrella aids in advancing the overall picture of CS techniques, while practically our results highlight the tradeoffs intrinsic to these measurement approaches, illuminating the circumstances under which either RLS or CS would be preferred, such as unverified randomness for the former or unbiased estimation for the latter."

    "summary": "Women's health in Bangladesh faces risks due to an alarming rise in cesarean section (CS) rates, exceeding 72% in hospital-based deliveries, far surpassing the WHO's recommended limit of 15%. This study, guided by the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), explored socio-cultural factors influencing childbirth mode decisions. Among 503 survey participants, 91% of CS cases occurred against initial preferences, revealing a disconnect between health beliefs and behavior. Subjective norms, particularly family influence and social expectations, emerged as more critical in shaping CS decisions than physician recommendations."

    "summary": "The expansion of computer science (CS) education in K--12 and higher-education in the United States has prompted deeper engagement with equity that moves beyond inclusion toward a more critical CS education. Rather than frame computing as a value-neutral tool, a justice-centered approach to equitable CS education draws on critical pedagogy to ensure the rightful presence of political struggles by emphasizing the development of not only knowledge and skills but also CS disciplinary identities. While recent efforts have integrated ethics into several areas of the undergraduate CS curriculum, critical approaches for teaching data structures and algorithms in particular are undertheorized. Basic Data Structures remains focused on runtime-centered algorithm analysis. We argue for affordance analysis, a more critical algorithm analysis based on an affordance account of value embedding. Drawing on critical methods from science and technology studies, philosophy of technology, and human-computer interaction, affordance analysis examines how the design of computational abstractions such as data structures and algorithms embody affordances, which in turn embody values with political consequences. We illustrate 5 case studies of how affordance analysis refutes social determination of technology, foregrounds the limitations of data abstractions, and implicates the design of algorithms in disproportionately distributing benefits and harms to particular social identities within the matrix of domination."

    "summary": "We present MeerKAT Fornax Survey atomic hydrogen (HI) observations of the dwarf galaxies located in the central ~2.5 x 4 deg of the Fornax galaxy cluster. The HI images presented in this work have a column density sensitivity between 2.7 and 50 x 10 cm over 25 km s for spatial resolution between 4 and 1 kpc. We are able to detect an impressive MHI = 5 x 10 Msun 3 point source with a line width of 50 km s at a distance of 20 Mpc. We detect HI in 17 out of the 304 dwarfs in our field -- 14 out of the 36 late type dwarfs (LTDs), and 3 of the 268 early type dwarfs (ETDs). The HI-detected LTDs have likely just joined the cluster and are on their first infall as they are located at large clustocentric radii, with comparable MHI and mean stellar surface brightness at fixed luminosity as blue, star-forming LTDs in the field. The HI-detected ETDs have likely been in the cluster longer than the LTDs and acquired their HI through a recent merger or accretion from nearby HI. Eight of the HI-detected LTDs host irregular or asymmetric HI emission and disturbed or lopsided stellar emission. There are two clear cases of ram-pressure shaping the HI, with the LTDs displaying compressed HI on the side closest to the cluster centre and a one-sided, starless tail pointing away from the cluster centre. The HI-detected dwarfs avoid the most massive potentials, consistent with massive galaxies playing an active role in the removal of HI. We create a simple toy model to quantify the timescale of HI stripping in the cluster. We find that a MHI = 10 Msun dwarf will be stripped in ~ 240 Myr. The model is consistent with our observations, where low mass LTDs are directly stripped of their HI from a single encounter and more massive LTDs can harbour a disturbed HI morphology due to longer times or multiple encounters being required to fully strip their HI."

However, without accessing to the ground truth image, how to design the scene-dependent adaptive strategy is still an open-problem and the improvement in sampling efficiency is still quite limited. In this paper, a restricted isometry property (RIP) condition based error clamping is proposed, which could directly predict the reconstruction error, i.e. the difference between the currently-stage reconstructed image and the ground truth image, and adaptively allocate samples to different regions at the successive sampling stage. Furthermore, we propose a cascaded feature fusion reconstruction network that could efficiently utilize the information derived from different adaptive sampling stages. The effectiveness of the proposed adaptive and cascaded CS method is demonstrated with extensive quantitative and qualitative results, compared with the state-of-the-art CS algorithms."

    "title": "Hierarchical Sparse Channel Estimation for Massive MIMO",
    "summary": "The problem of wideband massive MIMO channel estimation is considered. Targeting for low complexity algorithms as well as small training overhead, a compressive sensing (CS) approach is pursued. Unfortunately, due to the Kronecker-type sensing (measurement) matrix corresponding to this setup, application of standard CS algorithms and analysis methodology does not apply. By recognizing that the channel possesses a special structure, termed hierarchical sparsity, we propose an efficient algorithm that explicitly takes into account this property. In addition, by extending the standard CS analysis methodology to hierarchical sparse vectors, we provide a rigorous analysis of the algorithm performance in terms of estimation error as well as number of pilot subcarriers required to achieve it. Small training overhead, in turn, means higher number of supported users in a cell and potentially improved pilot decontamination. We believe, that this is the first paper that draws a rigorous connection between the hierarchical framework and Kronecker measurements. Numerical results verify the advantage of employing the proposed approach in this setting instead of standard CS algorithms."

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise in complex reasoning, with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) being a key enhancement strategy. However, a prevalent issue is ``superficial self-reflection'', where models fail to robustly verify their own outputs. We introduce RISE (Reinforcing Reasoning with Self-Verification), a novel online RL framework designed to tackle this. RISE explicitly and simultaneously trains an LLM to improve both its problem-solving and self-verification abilities within a single, integrated RL process. The core mechanism involves leveraging verifiable rewards from an outcome verifier to provide on-the-fly feedback for both solution generation and self-verification tasks. In each iteration, the model generates solutions, then critiques its own on-policy generated solutions, with both trajectories contributing to the policy update. Extensive experiments on diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that RISE consistently improves model's problem-solving accuracy while concurrently fostering strong self-verification skills. Our analyses highlight the advantages of online verification and the benefits of increased verification compute. Additionally, RISE models exhibit more frequent and accurate self-verification behaviors during reasoning. These advantages reinforce RISE as a flexible and effective path towards developing more robust and self-aware reasoners."

The secondary network operates in three modes; Cooperative Sensing (CS), Full Duplex Transmit and Sensing (FDTS), and Full Duplex Transmit and Receive (FDTR). In the CS mode, the secondary nodes detect the activity of primary users (PUs) through a novel cooperative MAC protocol and will decide the systems mode of operation in the subsequent spectrum hole. In the FDTS mode one of the SUs senses the PUs activity continuously whilst transmitting to another node. In the FDTR mode, the SUs would communicate bidirectionally in an asynchronous full duplex (FD) manner, with decreased maximum and average collision durations. Analytical closed forms for probability of collision, average collision duration and cumulative collision duration, as well as throughput of the SU network are derived, and performance of the proposed protocol in terms of above-mentioned metrics, its effectiveness, and advantages over conventional methods of sensing and transmission are verified via simulations"

    "summary": "This work is a continuation of efforts to define and understand competitive analysis of algorithms in a distributed shared memory setting, which is surprisingly different from the classical online setting. In fact, in a distributed shared memory setting, we find a counter-example to the theorem concerning classical randomized online algorithms which shows that, if there is a -competitive randomized algorithm against an adaptive offline adversary, then there is a -competitive deterministic algorithm [Ben-David, Borodin, Karp, Tardos, Wigderson, 1994]. In a distributed setting, there is additional lack of knowledge concerning what the other processes have done. There is also additional power for the adversary, having control of the scheduler which decides when each process is allowed to take steps. We consider the list accessing problem, which is a benchmark problem for sequential online algorithms. In the distributed version of this problem, each process has its own finite sequence of requests to a shared list. The scheduler arises as a major issue in its competitive analysis. We introduce two different adversaries, which differ in how they are allowed to schedule processes, and use them to perform competitive analysis of distributed list accessing. We prove tight upper and lower bounds on combinatorial properties of merges of the request sequences, which we use in the analysis. Our analysis shows that the effects of the adversarial scheduler can be quite significant, dominating the usual quality loss due to lack of information about the future."

When the train and test data come from different domains, the model is likely to struggle, as it is not adapted to the test domain. We propose a new approach for domain adaptation (DA), using neuron-level interventions: We modify the representation of each test example in specific neurons, resulting in a counterfactual example from the source domain, which the model is more familiar with. The modified example is then fed back into the model. While most other DA methods are applied during training time, ours is applied during inference only, making it more efficient and applicable. Our experiments show that our method improves performance on unseen domains."

To account for occlusions in the CS features, we propose an Image Attention (IA) module to allow the network to focus on CS features from one frame over those of the other. TAIN outperforms existing methods that do not require flow estimation and performs comparably to flow-based methods while being computationally efficient in terms of inference time on Vimeo90k, UCF101, and SNU-FILM benchmarks."

Studying the characteristics of this sample helps us to better understand the features of spam and spam vulnerable e-mail accounts. We believe that this analysis is highly useful to develop more efficient anti spam techniques. In our analysis we classified spam based on attachment and contents. According to our study the four years old heavy users email accounts attract more spam than four years oldlight users mail accounts. The 14 months old relatively new email accounts don't receive spam. In some special cases like DDoS attacks, the new email accounts receive spam.

The survey covers the inner 1 Mpc around the cluster centre, extending out to 1.5 Mpc towards the south-western NGC 4839 group. The survey probes the atomic gas in the entire Coma volume down to a sensitivity of 10 cm and 10 M . Combining automated source finding with source extraction at optical redshifts and visual verification, we obtained 40 HI detections of which 24 are new. Over half of the sample displays perturbed HI morphologies indicative of an ongoing interaction with the cluster environment. With the use of ancillary UV and mid-IR, data we measured their stellar masses and star formation rates and compared the HI properties to a set of field galaxies spanning a similar stellar mass and star formation rate range. We find that 75 % of HI-selected Coma galaxies have simultaneously enhanced star formation rates (by 0.2 dex) and are HI deficient (by 0.5 dex) compared to field galaxies of the same stellar mass. According to our toy model, the simultaneous HI deficiency and enhanced star formation activity can be attributed to either HI stripping of already highly star forming galaxies on a very short timescale, while their H content remains largely unaffected, or to HI stripping coupled to a temporary boost of the HI-to-H conversion, causing a brief starburst phase triggered by ram pressure before eventually quenching the galaxy."

    "title": "Compressive Acquisition of Dynamic Scenes",
    "summary": "Compressive sensing (CS) is a new approach for the acquisition and recovery of sparse signals and images that enables sampling rates significantly below the classical Nyquist rate. Despite significant progress in the theory and methods of CS, little headway has been made in compressive video acquisition and recovery. Video CS is complicated by the ephemeral nature of dynamic events, which makes direct extensions of standard CS imaging architectures and signal models difficult. In this paper, we develop a new framework for video CS for dynamic textured scenes that models the evolution of the scene as a linear dynamical system (LDS). This reduces the video recovery problem to first estimating the model parameters of the LDS from compressive measurements, and then reconstructing the image frames. We exploit the low-dimensional dynamic parameters (the state sequence) and high-dimensional static parameters (the observation matrix) of the LDS to devise a novel compressive measurement strategy that measures only the dynamic part of the scene at each instant and accumulates measurements over time to estimate the static parameters. This enables us to lower the compressive measurement rate considerably. We validate our approach with a range of experiments involving both video recovery, sensing hyper-spectral data, and classification of dynamic scenes from compressive data. Together, these applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach."

    "title": "Mixed one-bit compressive sensing with applications to overexposure correction for CT reconstruction",
    "summary": "When a measurement falls outside the quantization or measurable range, it becomes saturated and cannot be used in classical reconstruction methods. For example, in C-arm angiography systems, which provide projection radiography, fluoroscopy, digital subtraction angiography, and are widely used for medical diagnoses and interventions, the limited dynamic range of C-arm flat detectors leads to overexposure in some projections during an acquisition, such as imaging relatively thin body parts (e.g., the knee). Aiming at overexposure correction for computed tomography (CT) reconstruction, we in this paper propose a mixed one-bit compressive sensing (M1bit-CS) to acquire information from both regular and saturated measurements. This method is inspired by the recent progress on one-bit compressive sensing, which deals with only sign observations. Its successful applications imply that information carried by saturated measurements is useful to improve recovery quality. For the proposed M1bit-CS model, alternating direction methods of multipliers is developed and an iterative saturation detection scheme is established. Then we evaluate M1bit-CS on one-dimensional signal recovery tasks. In some experiments, the performance of the proposed algorithms on mixed measurements is almost the same as recovery on unsaturated ones with the same amount of measurements. Finally, we apply the proposed method to overexposure correction for CT reconstruction on a phantom and a simulated clinical image. The results are promising, as the typical streaking artifacts and capping artifacts introduced by saturated projection data are effectively reduced, yielding significant error reduction compared with existing algorithms based on extrapolation."

    "title": "Practical Compact Deep Compressed Sensing",
    "summary": "Recent years have witnessed the success of deep networks in compressed sensing (CS), which allows for a significant reduction in sampling cost and has gained growing attention since its inception. In this paper, we propose a new practical and compact network dubbed PCNet for general image CS. Specifically, in PCNet, a novel collaborative sampling operator is designed, which consists of a deep conditional filtering step and a dual-branch fast sampling step. The former learns an implicit representation of a linear transformation matrix into a few convolutions and first performs adaptive local filtering on the input image, while the latter then uses a discrete cosine transform and a scrambled block-diagonal Gaussian matrix to generate under-sampled measurements. Our PCNet is equipped with an enhanced proximal gradient descent algorithm-unrolled network for reconstruction. It offers flexibility, interpretability, and strong recovery performance for arbitrary sampling rates once trained. Additionally, we provide a deployment-oriented extraction scheme for single-pixel CS imaging systems, which allows for the convenient conversion of any linear sampling operator to its matrix form to be loaded onto hardware like digital micro-mirror devices. Extensive experiments on natural image CS, quantized CS, and self-supervised CS demonstrate the superior reconstruction accuracy and generalization ability of PCNet compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly for high-resolution images.

This SN shows a possible shock-breakout signal \\,hr after the explosion in the unfiltered light curve, and prominent flash-ionisation spectral features within the first week. The unusual photospheric temperature rise (rapidly from \\,K to above 18,000\\,K) within the earliest few days suggests that the ejecta were continuously heated. Both the significant temperature rise and the flash spectral features can be explained with the interaction of the SN ejecta with the massive stellar wind ( ), which accounts for the luminous peak ( ) of SN 2018zd. The luminous peak and low expansion velocity ( km s ) make SN 2018zd to be like a member of the LLEV (luminous SNe II with low expansion velocities) events originated due to circumstellar interaction. The relatively fast post-peak decline allows a classification of SN 2018zd as a transition event morphologically linking SNe~IIP and SNe~IIL. In the radioactive-decay phase, SN 2018zd experienced a significant flux drop and behaved more like a low-luminosity SN~IIP both spectroscopically and photometrically. This contrast indicates that circumstellar interaction plays a vital role in modifying the observed light curves of SNe~II. Comparing nebular-phase spectra with model predictions suggests that SN 2018zd arose from a star of . Given the relatively small amount of Ni ( ), the massive stellar wind, and the faint X-ray radiation, the progenitor of SN 2018zd could be a massive asymptotic giant branch star which collapsed owing to electron capture."

Current MLC algorithms have not been designed to address these three issues simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, cost-sensitive dynamic principal projection (CS-DPP) that resolves all three issues. The foundation of CS-DPP is an online LSDR framework derived from a leading LSDR algorithm. In particular, CS-DPP is equipped with an efficient online dimension reducer motivated by matrix stochastic gradient, and establishes its theoretical backbone when coupled with a carefully-designed online regression learner. In addition, CS-DPP embeds the cost information into label weights to achieve cost-sensitivity along with theoretical guarantees. Experimental results verify that CS-DPP achieves better practical performance than current MLC algorithms across different evaluation criteria, and demonstrate the importance of resolving the three issues simultaneously."

    "summary": "Time-frequency distributions have been used to provide high resolution representation in a large number of signal processing applications. However, high resolution and accurate instantaneous frequency (IF) estimation usually depend on the employed distribution and complexity of signal phase function. To ensure an efficient IF tracking for various types of signals, the class of complex time distributions has been developed. These distributions facilitate analysis in the cases when standard distributions cannot provide satisfactory results (e.g., for highly nonstationary signal phase). In that sense, an ambiguity based form of the forth order complex-time distribution is considered, in a new compressive sensing (CS) context. CS is an intensively growing approach in signal processing that allows efficient analysis and reconstruction of randomly undersampled signals. In this paper, the randomly chosen ambiguity domain coefficients serve as CS measurements. By exploiting sparsity in the time-frequency plane, it is possible to obtain highly concentrated IF using just small number of random coefficients from ambiguity domain. Moreover, in noisy signal case, this CS approach can be efficiently combined with the L-statistics producing robust time-frequency representations. Noisy coefficients are firstly removed using the L-statistics and then reconstructed by using CS algorithm. The theoretical considerations are illustrated using experimental results."

However, the rather slow speed of MRI acquisitions limits the patient throughput and potential indi cations. Compressive Sensing (CS) has proven to be an efficient technique for accelerating MRI acquisition. The most widely used CS-MRI model, founded on the premise of reconstructing an image from an incompletely filled k-space, leads to an ill-posed inverse problem. In the past years, lots of efforts have been made to efficiently optimize the CS-MRI model. Inspired by deep learning techniques, some preliminary works have tried to incorporate deep architectures into CS-MRI process. Unfortunately, the convergence issues (due to the experience-based networks) and the robustness (i.e., lack real-world noise modeling) of these deeply trained optimization methods are still missing. In this work, we develop a new paradigm to integrate designed numerical solvers and the data-driven architectures for CS-MRI. By introducing an optimal condition checking mechanism, we can successfully prove the convergence of our established deep CS-MRI optimization scheme. Furthermore, we explicitly formulate the Rician noise distributions within our framework and obtain an extended CS-MRI network to handle the real-world nosies in the MRI process. Extensive experimental results verify that the proposed paradigm outperforms the existing state-of-the-art techniques both in reconstruction accuracy and efficiency as well as robustness to noises in real scene."

    "title": "Improving Imprecise Compressive Sensing Models",
    "summary": "Random sampling in compressive sensing (CS) enables the compression of large amounts of input signals in an efficient manner, which is useful for many applications. CS reconstructs the compressed signals exactly with overwhelming probability when incoming data can be sparsely represented with a few components. However, the theory of CS framework including random sampling has been focused on exact recovery of signal; impreciseness in signal recovery has been neglected. This can be problematic when there is uncertainty in the number of sparse components such as signal sparsity in dynamic systems that can change over time. We present a new theoretical framework that handles uncertainty in signal recovery from the perspective of recovery success and quality. We show that the signal recovery success in our model is more accurate than the success probability analysis in the CS framework. Our model is then extended to the case where the success or failure of signal recovery can be relaxed. We represent the number of components included in signal recovery with a right-tailed distribution and focus on recovery quality. Experimental results confirm the accuracy of our model in dynamic systems."

    "title": "Pairwise Elimination with Instance-Dependent Guarantees for Bandits with Cost Subsidy",
    "summary": "Multi-armed bandits (MAB) are commonly used in sequential online decision-making when the reward of each decision is an unknown random variable. In practice however, the typical goal of maximizing total reward may be less important than minimizing the total cost of the decisions taken, subject to a reward constraint. For example, we may seek to make decisions that have at least the reward of a reference ``default'' decision, with as low a cost as possible. This problem was recently introduced in the Multi-Armed Bandits with Cost Subsidy (MAB-CS) framework. MAB-CS is broadly applicable to problem domains where a primary metric (cost) is constrained by a secondary metric (reward), and the rewards are unknown. In our work, we address variants of MAB-CS including ones with reward constrained by the reward of a known reference arm or by the subsidized best reward. We introduce the Pairwise-Elimination (PE) algorithm for the known reference arm variant and generalize PE to PE-CS for the subsidized best reward variant. Our instance-dependent analysis of PE and PE-CS reveals that both algorithms have an order-wise logarithmic upper bound on Cost and Quality Regret, making our policies the first with such a guarantee. Moreover, by comparing our upper and lower bound results we establish that PE is order-optimal for all known reference arm problem instances. Finally, experiments are conducted using the MovieLens 25M and Goodreads datasets for both PE and PE-CS revealing the effectiveness of PE and the superior balance between performance and reliability offered by PE-CS compared to baselines from the literature."

    "title": "Evolving Prompts In-Context: An Open-ended, Self-replicating Perspective",
    "summary": "We propose a novel prompt design paradigm that challenges conventional wisdom in large language model (LLM) prompting. While conventional wisdom prioritizes well-crafted instructions and demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL), we show that pruning random demonstrations into seemingly incoherent \"gibberish\" can remarkably improve performance across diverse tasks. Notably, the \"gibberish\" always matches or surpasses state-of-the-art automatic prompt optimization techniques, achieving substantial gains regardless of LLM alignment. Nevertheless, discovering an effective pruning strategy is non-trivial, as existing attribution methods and prompt compression algorithms fail to deliver robust results, let alone human intuition. In terms of this, we propose a self-discover prompt optimization framework, PromptQuine, an evolutionary search framework that automatically searches for the pruning strategy by itself using only low-data regimes. Much like the emergent complexity in nature--such as symbiosis and self-organization--arising in response to resource constraints, our framework evolves and refines unconventional yet highly effective prompts by leveraging only the tokens present within the context. We demonstrate its effectiveness across classification, multi-choice question answering, generation and math reasoning tasks across LLMs, while achieving decent runtime efficiency. We hope our findings can guide mechanistic studies on in-context learning, and provide a call to action, to pave the way for more open-ended search algorithms for more effective LLM prompting."

    "title": "Invertible Diffusion Models for Compressed Sensing",
    "summary": "While deep neural networks (NN) significantly advance image compressed sensing (CS) by improving reconstruction quality, the necessity of training current CS NNs from scratch constrains their effectiveness and hampers rapid deployment. Although recent methods utilize pre-trained diffusion models for image reconstruction, they struggle with slow inference and restricted adaptability to CS. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes Invertible Diffusion Models (IDM), a novel efficient, end-to-end diffusion-based CS method. IDM repurposes a large-scale diffusion sampling process as a reconstruction model, and fine-tunes it end-to-end to recover original images directly from CS measurements, moving beyond the traditional paradigm of one-step noise estimation learning. To enable such memory-intensive end-to-end fine-tuning, we propose a novel two-level invertible design to transform both (1) multi-step sampling process and (2) noise estimation U-Net in each step into invertible networks. As a result, most intermediate features are cleared during training to reduce up to 93.8% GPU memory. In addition, we develop a set of lightweight modules to inject measurements into noise estimator to further facilitate reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that IDM outperforms existing state-of-the-art CS networks by up to 2.64dB in PSNR. Compared to the recent diffusion-based approach DDNM, our IDM achieves up to 10.09dB PSNR gain and 14.54 times faster inference. Code is available at https://github.com/Guaishou74851/IDM."

Communities are prevalent in social and biological networks, and can be used in product advertisement and social event recommendation. In this paper, we study profiled community search (PCS), where CS is performed on a profiled graph. This is a graph in which each vertex has labels arranged in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experiments show that PCS can identify communities with themes that are common to their vertices, and is more effective than existing CS approaches. As a naive solution for PCS is highly expensive, we have also developed a tree index, which facilitate efficient and online solutions for PCS."

    "summary": "Nonlocal self-similarity and group sparsity have been widely utilized in image compressive sensing (CS). However, when the sampling rate is low, the internal prior information of degraded images may be not enough for accurate restoration, resulting in loss of image edges and details. In this paper, we propose a joint group and residual sparse coding method for CS image recovery (JGRSC-CS). In the proposed JGRSC-CS, patch group is treated as the basic unit of sparse coding and two dictionaries (namely internal and external dictionaries) are applied to exploit the sparse representation of each group simultaneously. The internal self-adaptive dictionary is used to remove artifacts, and an external Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) dictionary, learned from clean training images, is used to enhance details and texture. To make the proposed method effective and robust, the split Bregman method is adopted to reconstruct the whole image. Experimental results manifest the proposed JGRSC-CS algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and visual quality."

    "summary": "Pre-trained large models attract widespread attention in recent years, but they face challenges in applications that require high interpretability or have limited resources, such as physical sensing, medical imaging, and bioinformatics. Compressed Sensing (CS) is a well-proved theory that drives many recent breakthroughs in these applications. However, as a typical under-determined linear system, CS suffers from excessively long sparse reconstruction times when using traditional iterative methods, particularly with large-scale data. Current AI methods like deep unfolding fail to substitute them because pre-trained models exhibit poor generality beyond their training conditions and dataset distributions, or lack interpretability. Instead of following the big model fervor, this paper proposes ultra-small artificial neural models called coefficients learning (CL), enabling training-free and rapid sparse reconstruction while perfectly inheriting the generality and interpretability of traditional iterative methods, bringing new feature of incorporating prior knowledges. In CL, a signal of length only needs a minimal of trainable parameters. A case study model called CLOMP is implemented for evaluation. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real one-dimensional and two-dimensional signals, demonstrating significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy. Compared to representative iterative methods, CLOMP improves efficiency by 100 to 1000 folds for large-scale data. Test results on eight diverse image datasets indicate that CLOMP improves structural similarity index by 292%, 98%, 45% for sampling rates of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, respectively. We believe this method can truly usher CS reconstruction into the AI era, benefiting countless under-determined linear systems that rely on sparse solution."

    "summary": "Hybrid beamforming (HB) architectures are attractive for wireless communication systems with large antenna arrays because the analog beamforming stage can significantly reduce the number of RF transceivers and hence power consumption. In HB systems, channel estimation (CE) becomes challenging due to indirect access by the baseband processing to the communication channels and due to low SNR before beam alignment. Compressed sensing (CS) based algorithms have been adopted to address these challenges by leveraging the sparse nature of millimeter wave multi-input multi-output (mmWave MIMO) channels. In many CS algorithms for narrowband CE, the hybrid beamformers are randomly configured which does not always yield the low-coherence sensing matrices desirable for those CS algorithms whose recovery guarantees rely on coherence. In this paper, we propose a versatile deterministic HB codebook design framework for CS algorithms with coherence-based recovery guarantees to enhance CE accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed design can obtain lower channel estimation error and higher spectral efficiency compared with random codebook for phase-shifter-, switch-, and lens-based HB architectures."

This adaptability makes human capital the most crucial factor in ensuring a sustainable growth of industry/sector. As new technologies are developed and adopted, the new generations are required to acquire skills in newer technologies in order to be employable. At the same time professionals are required to upskill and reskill themselves to remain relevant in the industry. There is however no straightforward method to identify the skill needs of the industry at a given point of time. Therefore, this paper proposes a data to decision framework that can successfully identify the desired skill set in a given area by analysing the advertorial data collected from popular online job portals and supplied as input to the framework. The proposed framework uses techniques of statistical analysis, data mining and natural language processing for the purpose. The applicability of the framework is demonstrated on CS&IT job advertisement data from India. The analytical results not only provide useful insights about current state of skill needs in CS&IT industry but also provide practical implications to prospective job applicants, training agencies, and institutions of higher education & professional training."

To increase efficiency, we have to select different TQ for processes. The main objective of RR is to reduce the CS, maximize the utilization of CPU and minimize the turn around and the waiting time. In this paper, we have considered different TQ for a group of processes. It reduces CS as well as enhancing the performance of RR algorithm. TQ can be calculated using min-max dispersion measure.

While advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world domains.

The survey has a resolution of 67''x95'' and 6.6 km with a 3 sensitivity of N(HI)~2x10 cm and MHI 2x10 M . We detect 16 galaxies out of 200 spectroscopically confirmed Fornax cluster members. The detections cover ~3 orders of magnitude in HI mass, from 8x10 to 1.5x10 M . They avoid the central, virialised region of the cluster both on the sky and in projected phase-space, showing that they are recent arrivals and that, in Fornax, HI is lost within a crossing time, ~2 Gyr. Half of these galaxies exhibit a disturbed HI morphology, including several cases of asymmetries, tails, offsets between HI and optical centres, and a case of a truncated HI disc suggesting that they have been interacting within or on their way to Fornax. Our HI detections are HI-poorer and form stars at a lower rate than non-cluster galaxies in the same range. Low mass galaxies are more strongly affected throughout their infall towards the cluster. The MHI/ ratio of Fornax galaxies is comparable to that in the Virgo cluster. At fixed , our HI detections follow the non-cluster relation between MHI and the star formation rate, and we argue that this implies that so far they have lost their HI on a timescale 1-2 Gyr. Deeper inside the cluster HI removal is likely to proceed faster, as confirmed by a population of HI-undetected but H -detected star-forming galaxies. Based on ALMA data, we find a large scatter in H -to-HI mass ratio, with several galaxies showing an unusually high ratio that is probably caused by faster HI removal. We identify an HI-rich subgroup of possible interacting galaxies dominated by NGC 1365, where pre-processing is likey to have taken place."

This motivates the development of channel scheduling (CS) methods that mitigate device collisions efficiently in such scenarios, which constitutes the scope of this work. Specifically, we present a quadratic program (QP) formulation for the CS problem considering the joint activation probabilities among devices. This formulation allows the devices to stochastically select the transmit channels, thus, leading to a soft-clustering approach. We prove that the optimal QP solution can only be attained when it is transformed into a hard-clustering problem, leading to a pure integer QP, which we transform into a pure integer linear program (PILP). We leverage the branch-and-cut (B&C) algorithm to solve PILP optimally. Due to the high computational cost of B&C, we resort to some sub-optimal clustering methods with low computational costs to tackle the clustering problem in CS. Our findings demonstrate that the CS strategy, sourced from B&C, significantly outperforms those derived from sub-optimal clustering methods, even amidst increased device correlation."

By contrast, lens-array using antenna switching network (ASN) simplifies the hardware, but the associated CE is a challenging task due to the constraint imposed by ASN. This paper proposes a compressive sensing (CS)-based CE solution for full-dimensional (FD) lens-array, where the mmWave channel sparsity is exploited. Specifically, we first propose an approach of pilot training under the more severe haraware constraint imposed by ASN, and formulate the associated CE of lens-array as a CS problem. Then, a redundant dictionary is tailored for FD lens-array to combat the power leakage caused by the continuous angles of multipath components. Further, we design the baseband pilot signals to minimize the total mutual coherence of the measurement matrix based on CS theory for more reliable CE performance. Our solution provides a framework for applying CS techniques to lens-array using simple and practical ASN. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."

    "summary": "Compressive Sensing (CS) theory shows that a signal can be decoded from many fewer measurements than suggested by the Nyquist sampling theory, when the signal is sparse in some domain. Most of conventional CS recovery approaches, however, exploited a set of fixed bases (e.g. DCT, wavelet, contourlet and gradient domain) for the entirety of a signal, which are irrespective of the nonstationarity of natural signals and cannot achieve high enough degree of sparsity, thus resulting in poor rate-distortion performance. In this paper, we propose a new framework for image compressive sensing recovery via structural group sparse representation (SGSR) modeling, which enforces image sparsity and self-similarity simultaneously under a unified framework in an adaptive group domain, thus greatly confining the CS solution space. In addition, an efficient iterative shrinkage/thresholding algorithm based technique is developed to solve the above optimization problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the novel CS recovery strategy achieves significant performance improvements over the current state-of-the-art schemes and exhibits nice convergence."

Several CS reconstruction models have been recently proposed and obtained superior performance. However, there still exist two important challenges within the CS theory. The first one is how to design a sampling mechanism to achieve an optimal sampling efficiency, and the second one is how to perform the reconstruction to get the highest quality to achieve an optimal signal recovery. In this paper, we try to deal with these two problems with a deep network. First of all, we train a sampling matrix via the network training instead of using a traditional manually designed one, which is much appropriate for our deep network based reconstruct process. Then, we propose a deep network to recover the image, which imitates traditional compressed sensing reconstruction processes. Experimental results demonstrate that our deep networks based CS reconstruction method offers a very significant quality improvement compared against state of the art ones."

Recovery guarantees for CS are generally derived based on the assumption that measurement projections are selected independently at random. However, for many practical signal acquisition applications, including medical imaging and remote sensing, this assumption is violated as the projections must be taken in groups. In this paper, we consider such applications and derive requirements on the number of measurements needed for successful recovery of signals when groups of dependent projections are taken at random. We find a penalty factor on the number of required measurements with respect to the standard CS scheme that employs conventional independent measurement selection and evaluate the accuracy of the predicted penalty through simulations."

To alleviate these issues, we unroll the iterative feature refinement procedures in IFR-CS to a supervised model-driven network, dubbed IFR-Net. Equipped with training data pairs, both regularization parameter and the utmost feature refinement operator in IFR-CS become trainable. Additionally, inspired by the powerful representation capability of convolutional neural network (CNN), CNN-based inversion blocks are explored in the sparsity-promoting denoising module to generalize the sparsity-enforcing operator. Extensive experiments on both simulated and in vivo MR datasets have shown that the proposed network possesses a strong capability to capture image details and preserve well the structural information with fast reconstruction speed."

The cascaded residual convolutional network then fully reconstructs the image from optimized latent representation. As the first deep CS framework efficiently bridging adaptive online optimization, the R CS-NET integrates the robustness of online optimization with the efficiency and nonlinear capacity of deep learning methods. Signal correlation has been addressed through the network architecture. The adaptive sensing nature further makes it an ideal candidate for color image CS via leveraging channel correlation. Numerical experiments verify the proposed recurrent latent optimization design not only fulfills the adaptation motivation, but also outperforms classic long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture in the same scenario.

Storage of such a 3D scene can be done in two ways; (1) storing 2D images taken from the 3D scene that can reconstruct the scene back through interpolations, or (2) storing a representation of the 3D scene itself that already encodes views from all directions. So far, traditional 3D compression methods have focused on the first type of storage and compressed the original 2D images with image compression techniques. With this approach, the user first decodes the stored 2D images and then renders the 3D scene. However, this separated procedure is inefficient since a large amount of 2D images have to be stored. In this work, we take a different approach and compress a functional representation of 3D scenes. In particular, we introduce a method to compress 3D scenes by compressing the neural networks that represent the scenes as neural radiance fields. Our method provides more efficient storage of 3D scenes since it does not store 2D images -- which are redundant when we render the scene from the neural functional representation."

Moreover, we show that, an interesting property of multi-way measurements allows us to build the reconstruction based on compressive linear measurements taken only in two selected modes, independently of the tensor order . In addition, it is proved that, in the matrix case and in a particular case with rd-order tensors where the same 2D sensor operator is applied to all mode-3 slices, the proposed reconstruction is stable in the sense that the approximation error is comparable to the one provided by the best low-multilinear-rank approximation, where is a threshold parameter that controls the approximation error. Through the analysis of the upper bound of the approximation error we show that, in the 2D case, an optimal value for the threshold parameter exists, which is confirmed by our simulation results. On the other hand, our experiments on 3D datasets show that very good reconstructions are obtained using , which means that this parameter does not need to be tuned. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate the stability and robustness of the method when it is applied to real-world 2D and 3D signals. A comparison with state-of-the-arts sparsity based CS methods specialized for multidimensional signals is also included. A very attractive characteristic of the proposed method is that it provides a direct computation, i.e. it is non-iterative in contrast to all existing sparsity based CS algorithms, thus providing super fast computations, even for large datasets."

Partitioning the reconstruction process into two complementary parts provides a natural trade-off between runtime and reconstruction quality. To exploit the advantages of the two-part framework, we propose a Noisy-Sudocodes algorithm that performs two-part reconstruction of sparse signals in the presence of measurement noise. Specifically, we design a fast algorithm for Part 1 of Noisy-Sudocodes that identifies the zero coefficients of the input signal from its noisy measurements. Many existing CS algorithms could be applied to Part 2, and we investigate approximate message passing (AMP) and binary iterative hard thresholding (BIHT). For Noisy-Sudocodes with AMP in Part 2, we provide a theoretical analysis that characterizes the trade-off between runtime and reconstruction quality. In a 1-bit CS setting where a new 1-bit quantizer is constructed for Part 1 and BIHT is applied to Part 2, numerical results show that the Noisy-Sudocodes algorithm improves over BIHT in both runtime and reconstruction quality."

    "title": "A Novel Compressive Sensing based Enhanced Multiplexing Scheme for MIMO System",
    "summary": "A novel compressive-sensing based signal multiplexing scheme is proposed in this paper to further improve the multiplexing gain for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system. At the transmitter side, a Gaussian random measurement matrix in compressive sensing is employed before the traditional spatial multiplexing in order to carry more data streams on the available spatial multiplexing streams of the underlying MIMO system. At the receiver side, it is proposed to reformulate the detection of the multiplexing signal into two steps. In the first step, the traditional MIMO equalization can be used to restore the transmitted spatial multiplexing signal of the MIMO system. While in the second step, the standard optimization based detection algorithm assumed in the compressive sensing framework is utilized to restore the CS multiplexing data streams, wherein the exhaustive over-complete dictionary is used to guarantee the sparse representation of the CS multiplexing signal. In order to avoid the excessive complexity, the sub-block based dictionary and the sub-block based CS restoration is proposed. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the feasibility of the proposed CS based enhanced MIMO multiplexing scheme. And our efforts in this paper shed some lights on the great potential in further improving the spatial multiplexing gain for the MIMO system."

    "title": "Multi-Channel Deep Networks for Block-Based Image Compressive Sensing",
    "summary": "Incorporating deep neural networks in image compressive sensing (CS) receives intensive attentions in multimedia technology and applications recently. As deep network approaches learn the inverse mapping directly from the CS measurements, the reconstruction speed is significantly faster than the conventional CS algorithms. However, for existing network based approaches, a CS sampling procedure has to map a separate network model. This may potentially degrade the performance of image CS with block-wise sampling because of blocking artifacts, especially when multiple sampling rates are assigned to different blocks within an image. In this paper, we develop a multichannel deep network for block-based image CS by exploiting inter-block correlation with performance significantly exceeding the current state-of-the-art methods. The significant performance improvement is attributed to block-wise approximation but full image removal of blocking artifacts. Specifically, with our multichannel structure, the image blocks with a variety of sampling rates can be reconstructed in a single model. The initially reconstructed blocks are then capable of being reassembled into a full image to improve the recovered images by unrolling a hand-designed block based CS recovery algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art CS methods by a large margin in terms of objective metrics and subjective visual image quality.

    "title": "Spatiotemporal Sparse Bayesian Learning with Applications to Compressed Sensing of Multichannel Physiological Signals",
    "summary": "Energy consumption is an important issue in continuous wireless telemonitoring of physiological signals. Compressed sensing (CS) is a promising framework to address it, due to its energy-efficient data compression procedure. However, most CS algorithms have difficulty in data recovery due to non-sparsity characteristic of many physiological signals. Block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) is an effective approach to recover such signals with satisfactory recovery quality. However, it is time-consuming in recovering multichannel signals, since its computational load almost linearly increases with the number of channels. This work proposes a spatiotemporal sparse Bayesian learning algorithm to recover multichannel signals simultaneously. It not only exploits temporal correlation within each channel signal, but also exploits inter-channel correlation among different channel signals. Furthermore, its computational load is not significantly affected by the number of channels. The proposed algorithm was applied to brain computer interface (BCI) and EEG-based driver's drowsiness estimation. Results showed that the algorithm had both better recovery performance and much higher speed than BSBL. Particularly, the proposed algorithm ensured that the BCI classification and the drowsiness estimation had little degradation even when data were compressed by 80%, making it very suitable for continuous wireless telemonitoring of multichannel signals."

    "title": "On Detection-Directed Estimation Approach for Noisy Compressive Sensing",

This algorithm is quite robust against measurement noise and achieves the performance of a minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator that has support knowledge beyond a certain SNR threshold. The key idea behind CS-BSD is that reconstruction takes a detection-directed estimation structure consisting of two parts: support detection and signal value estimation. Belief propagation (BP) and a Bayesian hypothesis test perform support detection, and an MMSE estimator finds the signal values belonging to the support set. CS-BSD converges faster than other BP-based algorithms, and it can be converted to a parallel architecture to become much faster. Numerical results are provided to verify the superiority of CS-BSD compared to recent algorithms."

We study the issue of mode collapse of Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Network (BEGAN), which is one of the state-of-the-art generative models. Despite its potential of generating high-quality images, we find that BEGAN tends to collapse at some modes after a period of training. We propose a new model, called BEGAN with a Constrained Space (BEGAN-CS), which includes a latent-space constraint in the loss function. We show that BEGAN-CS can significantly improve training stability and suppress mode collapse without either increasing the model complexity or degrading the image quality. Further, we visualize the distribution of latent vectors to elucidate the effect of latent-space constraint. The experimental results show that our method has additional advantages of being able to train on small datasets and to generate images similar to a given real image yet with variations of designated attributes on-the-fly."

At the encoder, for each block of compressive sensing (CS) measurements, the optimal pre-diction is selected from a set of prediction candidates that are generated by four designed directional predictive modes. Then, the resulting residual is processed by scalar quantiza-tion (SQ). At the decoder, the same prediction is added onto the de-quantized residuals to produce the quantized CS measurements, which is exploited for CS reconstruction. Experimental results substantiate significant improvements achieved by SDPC-plus-SQ in rate distortion performance as compared with SQ alone and DPCM-plus-SQ."

    "title": "1-Bit Compressive Sensing: Reformulation and RRSP-Based Sign Recovery Theory",
    "summary": "Recently, the 1-bit compressive sensing (1-bit CS) has been studied in the field of sparse signal recovery. Since the amplitude information of sparse signals in 1-bit CS is not available, it is often the support or the sign of a signal that can be exactly recovered with a decoding method. In this paper, we first show that a necessary assumption (that has been overlooked in the literature) should be made for some existing theories and discussions for 1-bit CS. Without such an assumption, the found solution by some existing decoding algorithms might be inconsistent with 1-bit measurements. This motivates us to pursue a new direction to develop uniform and nonuniform recovery theories for 1-bit CS with a new decoding method which always generates a solution consistent with 1-bit measurements. We focus on an extreme case of 1-bit CS, in which the measurements capture only the sign of the product of a sensing matrix and a signal. We show that the 1-bit CS model can be reformulated equivalently as an -minimization problem with linear constraints. This reformulation naturally leads to a new linear-program-based decoding method, referred to as the 1-bit basis pursuit, which is remarkably different from existing formulations. It turns out that the uniqueness condition for the solution of the 1-bit basis pursuit yields the so-called restricted range space property (RRSP) of the transposed sensing matrix. This concept provides a basis to develop sign recovery conditions for sparse signals through 1-bit measurements. We prove that if the sign of a sparse signal can be exactly recovered from 1-bit measurements with 1-bit basis pursuit, then the sensing matrix must admit a certain RRSP, and that if the sensing matrix admits a slightly enhanced RRSP, then the sign of a -sparse signal can be exactly recovered with 1-bit basis pursuit."

    "summary": "Compressed sensing (CS) is a signal acquisition paradigm to simultaneously acquire and reduce dimension of signals that admit sparse representations. When such a signal is acquired according to the principles of CS, the measurements still take on values in the continuum. In today's \"digital\" world, a subsequent quantization step, where these measurements are replaced with elements from a finite set is crucial. We focus on one of the approaches that yield efficient quantizers for CS: quantization, followed by a one-stage tractable reconstruction method, which was developed by Saab et al. with theoretical error guarantees in the case of sub-Gaussian matrices. We propose two alternative approaches that extend this result to a wider class of measurement matrices including (certain unitary transforms of) partial bounded orthonormal systems and deterministic constructions based on chirp sensing matrices."

    "summary": "The one-bit quantization is implemented by one single comparator that operates at low power and a high rate. Hence one-bit compressive sensing (1bit-CS) becomes attractive in signal processing. When measurements are corrupted by noise during signal acquisition and transmission, 1bit-CS is usually modeled as minimizing a loss function with a sparsity constraint. The one-sided loss and the linear loss are two popular loss functions for 1bit-CS. To improve the decoding performance on noisy data, we consider the pinball loss, which provides a bridge between the one-sided loss and the linear loss. Using the pinball loss, two convex models, an elastic-net pinball model and its modification with the -norm constraint, are proposed. To efficiently solve them, the corresponding dual coordinate ascent algorithms are designed and their convergence is proved. The numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and the performance of the pinball loss minimization for 1bit-CS."

The fact that the hidden periodicities, referred to as cyclic moments, are often compressible in the Fourier domain motivates the use of compressive sensing (CS) as an efficient acquisition protocol for capturing such signals. In this work, we consider the class of Temporal Higher Order Cyclostationary Statistics (THOCS) estimators when CS is used to acquire the cyclostationary signal assuming compressible cyclic moments in the Fourier domain. We develop a theoretical framework for estimating THOCS using the low-rate nonuniform sampling protocol from CS and illustrate the performance of this framework using simulated data."

    "summary": "This paper investigates a new class of carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) protocols that employ deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques for heterogeneous wireless networking, referred to as carrier-sense deep-reinforcement learning multiple access (CS-DLMA). Existing CSMA protocols, such as the medium access control (MAC) of WiFi, are designed for a homogeneous network environment in which all nodes adopt the same protocol. Such protocols suffer from severe performance degradation in a heterogeneous environment where there are nodes adopting other MAC protocols. This paper shows that DRL techniques can be used to design efficient MAC protocols for heterogeneous networking. In particular, in a heterogeneous environment with nodes adopting different MAC protocols (e.g., CS-DLMA, TDMA, and ALOHA), a CS-DLMA node can learn to maximize the sum throughput of all nodes. Furthermore, compared with WiFi's CSMA, CS-DLMA can achieve both higher sum throughput and individual throughputs when coexisting with other MAC protocols. Last but not least, a salient feature of CS-DLMA is that it does not need to know the operating mechanisms of the co-existing MACs. Neither does it need to know the number of nodes using these other MACs."

    "title": "Towards Efficient Compressive Data Collection in the Internet of Things",

Due to the inherent structural properties (e.g., sparsity) existing in many signals of interest, compressive sensing (CS) technology has been extensively used for data collection in IoT to improve both accuracy and energy efficiency. Apart from the existing works which leverage CS as a channel coding scheme to deal with data loss during transmission, some recent results have started to employ CS as a source coding strategy. The frequently used projection matrices in these CS-based source coding schemes include dense random matrices (e.g., Gaussian matrices or Bernoulli matrices) and structured matrices (e.g., Toeplitz matrices). However, these matrices are either difficult to be implemented on resource-constrained IoT sensor nodes or have limited applicability. To address these issues, in this paper, we design a novel simple and efficient projection matrix, named sparse Gaussian matrix, which is easy and resource-saving to be implemented in practical IoT applications. We conduct both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation of the designed sparse Gaussian matrix. The results demonstrate that employing the designed projection matrix to perform CS-based source coding could significantly save time and memory cost while ensuring satisfactory signal recovery performance."

In this work, we describe an E2E ASR pipeline for the recognition of CS speech in which a low-resourced language is mixed with a high resourced language. Low-resourcedness in acoustic data hinders the performance of E2E ASR systems more severely than the conventional ASR systems.~To mitigate this problem in the transcription of archives with code-switching Frisian-Dutch speech, we integrate a designated decoding scheme and perform rescoring with neural network-based language models to enable better utilization of the available textual resources. We first incorporate a multi-graph decoding approach which creates parallel search spaces for each monolingual and mixed recognition tasks to maximize the utilization of the textual resources from each language. Further, language model rescoring is performed using a recurrent neural network pre-trained with cross-lingual embedding and further adapted with the limited amount of in-domain CS text. The ASR experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the described techniques in improving the recognition performance of an E2E CS ASR system in a low-resourced scenario."

In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical InTeractive Video CS Reconstruction Network(HIT-VCSNet), which can cooperatively exploit the deep priors in both spatial and temporal domains to improve the reconstruction quality. Specifically, in the spatial domain, a novel hierarchical structure is designed, which can hierarchically extract deep features from keyframes and non-keyframes.

Extensive experiments manifest that the proposed HIT-VCSNet outperforms the existing state-of-the-art video and image CS methods in a large margin."

Across all papers in the ACM Digital Library prior to August 2023, we only find 94 such papers. We first classify these papers by topic, evaluation metric, evaluation methods, and intervention target. Through our classification, we find a broad sparsity of papers which indicates that many open questions remain about teaching algorithm design, with each algorithm topic only being discussed in between 0 and 10 papers. We also note the need for papers using rigorous research methods, as only 38 out of 88 papers presenting quantitative data use statistical tests, and only 15 out of 45 papers presenting qualitative data use a coding scheme. Only 17 papers report controlled trials. We then synthesize the results of the existing literature to give insights into what the corpus reveals about how we should teach algorithms. Much of the literature explores implementing well-established practices, such as active learning or automated assessment, in the algorithms classroom. However, there are algorithms-specific results as well: a number of papers find that students may under-utilize certain algorithmic design techniques, and studies describe a variety of ways to select algorithms problems that increase student engagement and learning. The results we present, along with the publicly available set of papers collected, provide a detailed representation of the current corpus of CS Education work related to algorithm design and can orient further research in the area."

We compare these approaches against dictionary-based replacements. We assess the quality of the generated sentences through human evaluation and evaluate the effectiveness of data augmentation on machine translation (MT), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and speech translation (ST) tasks. Results show that using a predictive model results in more natural CS sentences compared to the random approach, as reported in human judgements. In the downstream tasks, despite the random approach generating more data, both approaches perform equally (outperforming dictionary-based replacements). Overall, data augmentation achieves 34% improvement in perplexity, 5.2% relative improvement on WER for ASR task, +4.0-5.1 BLEU points on MT task, and +2.1-2.2 BLEU points on ST over a baseline trained on available data without augmentation."

While this setup usually assumes sparsity or compressibility in the input signal during recovery, the signal structure that can be leveraged is often not known a priori. In this paper, we consider universal CS recovery, where the statistics of a stationary ergodic signal source are estimated simultaneously with the signal itself. Inspired by Kolmogorov complexity and minimum description length, we focus on a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation framework that leverages universal priors to match the complexity of the source. Our framework can also be applied to general linear inverse problems where more measurements than in CS might be needed. We provide theoretical results that support the algorithmic feasibility of universal MAP estimation using a Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation, which is computationally challenging. We incorporate some techniques to accelerate the algorithm while providing comparable and in many cases better reconstruction quality than existing algorithms. Experimental results show the promise of universality in CS, particularly for low-complexity sources that do not exhibit standard sparsity or compressibility."

Specifically, our framework is based on the fundamental duality between the transform domain sparsity in the primary space and the low-rankness of weighted Hankel matrix in the reciprocal space, which converts pMRI and CS-MRI to a k-space interpolation problem using structured matrix completion. Using theoretical results from the latest compressed sensing literatures, we showed that the required sampling rates for ALOHA may achieve the optimal rate. Experimental results with in vivo data for single/multi-coil imaging as well as dynamic imaging confirmed that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art pMRI and CS-MRI."

These sources represent external latent variables acting on the causal graph constructed from the EHR data and approximate root causes of CS in our population. A random forest model trained on patient expressions of these sources demonstrated good accuracy (ROC 0.771) and identified the top 10 most predictive sources of CS in migraine patients. These sources revealed that pharmacologic interventions were the most important factor in minimizing CS risk in our population and identified a factor related to allergic rhinitis as a potential causative source of CS in migraine patients."

While there has been a handful of previously proposed Bayesian dynamic CS algorithms in the literature, the ability to perform inference on high-dimensional problems in a computationally efficient manner remains elusive. In response, we propose a probabilistic dynamic CS signal model that captures both amplitude and support correlation structure, and describe an approximate message passing algorithm that performs soft signal estimation and support detection with a computational complexity that is linear in all problem dimensions. The algorithm, DCS-AMP, can perform either causal filtering or non-causal smoothing, and is capable of learning model parameters adaptively from the data through an expectation-maximization learning procedure. We provide numerical evidence that DCS-AMP performs within 3 dB of oracle bounds on synthetic data under a variety of operating conditions. We further describe the result of applying DCS-AMP to two real dynamic CS datasets, as well as a frequency estimation task, to bolster our claim that DCS-AMP is capable of offering state-of-the-art performance and speed on real-world high-dimensional problems."

We summarize two aspects that need further enhancement to contribute to LTR boosting: (1) More diverse experts; (2) Lower model variance. However, the previous methods didn't handle them well. To this end, we propose More Diverse experts with Consistency Self-distillation (MDCS) to bridge the gap left by earlier methods. Our MDCS approach consists of two core components: Diversity Loss (DL) and Consistency Self-distillation (CS). In detail, DL promotes diversity among experts by controlling their focus on different categories. To reduce the model variance, we employ KL divergence to distill the richer knowledge of weakly augmented instances for the experts' self-distillation. In particular, we design Confident Instance Sampling (CIS) to select the correctly classified instances for CS to avoid biased/noisy knowledge. In the analysis and ablation study, we demonstrate that our method compared with previous work can effectively increase the diversity of experts, significantly reduce the variance of the model, and improve recognition accuracy. Moreover, the roles of our DL and CS are mutually reinforcing and coupled: the diversity of experts benefits from the CS, and the CS cannot achieve remarkable results without the DL. Experiments show our MDCS outperforms the state-of-the-art by 1% 2% on five popular long-tailed benchmarks, including CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, Places-LT, and iNaturalist 2018.

    "title": "Underrepresentation of women in computer systems research",
    "summary": "The gender gap in computer science (CS) research is a well-studied problem, with an estimated ratio of 15%--30% women researchers. However, far less is known about gender representation in specific fields within CS. Here, we investigate the gender gap in one large field, computer systems. To this end, we combined data from 53 leading systems conferences with external demographic and bibliometric data to evaluate the ratio of women authors and the factors that might affect this ratio. Our main findings are that women represent only about 10% of systems researchers, and that this ratio is not associated with various conference factors such as size, prestige, double-blind reviewing, and inclusivity policies. Author research experience also does not significantly affect this ratio, although author country and work sector do. The 10% ratio of women authors is significantly lower than that of CS as a whole. Our findings suggest that focusing on inclusivity policies alone cannot address this large gap. Increasing women's participation in systems research will require addressing the systemic causes of their exclusion, which are even more pronounced in systems than in the rest of CS."

The line segment clipping by the rectangular window in E2 is often restricted to the use of the Cohen-Sutherland (CS) algorithm or its modifications based on some presumptions like small clipping window or more sophisticated coding technique, etc. The line clipping problem solution is a bottleneck of many packages and applications and, therefore, it would be desirable to use the fastest algorithm even though it is more complex."

    "summary": "Cloud computing for storing data and running complex algorithms have been steadily increasing. As connected IoT devices such as wearable ECG recorders generally have less storage and computational capacity, acquired signals get sent to a remote center for storage and possible analysis on demand. Recently, compressive sensing (CS) has been used as secure, energy-efficient method of signal sampling in such recorders. In this paper, we propose a secure procedure to outsource the total recovery of CS measurement to the cloud and introduce a privacy-assured signal recovery technique in the cloud. We present a fast, and lightweight encryption for secure CS recovery outsourcing that can be used in wearable devices, such as ECG Holter monitors. In the proposed technique, instead of full recovery of CS-compressed ECG signal in the cloud, to preserve privacy, an encrypted version of ECG signal is recovered by using a randomly bipolar permuted measurement matrix. The user with a key, decrypts the encrypted ECG from the cloud to obtain the original ECG signal. We demonstrate our proposed method using the ECG signals available in the MITBIH Arrhythmia Database. We also demonstrate the strength of the proposed method against partial exposure of the key."

    "summary": "Differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) is recently coupled with uniform scalar quantization (SQ) to improve the rate-distortion (RD) performance for the block-based quantized compressive sensing (CS) of images. In this framework, for each block's CS measurements, a prediction is generated based on the reconstructed CS measurements of the previous blocks and subtracted from measurements of the current block in the measurement domain. The resulting residual is then quantized by uniform SQ to generate the quantization index. However, the entropy coding is still required to remove the statistical redundancies between the quantization indices and generate the bitstream. Thus, in this paper, we proposed an arithmetic coding scheme for the quantization index within DPCM-plus-SQ framework by analyzing their statistics. Experimental results demonstrate that further RD performance can be achieved compared to original DPCM-plus-SQ scheme and transform coefficient coding in CABAC."

SPICE circuit and MATLAB algorithm simulation results indicate that ACMCA reduces reconstruction Time-Averaged Normalized Mean Squared Error (TNMSE) by 5dB on average while providing up to 160 m area reduction compared to a similar previous design presented in the literature while incurring a negligible increase in the energy consumption of generating the CS measurement matrix."

However, the performance of current CS-based algorithms, in terms of compression rate and reconstruction quality of the ECG, still falls short of the performance attained by state-of-the-art wavelet based algorithms. In this paper, we propose to exploit the structure of the wavelet representation of the ECG signal to boost the performance of CS-based methods for compression and reconstruction of ECG signals. More precisely, we incorporate prior information about the wavelet dependencies across scales into the reconstruction algorithms and exploit the high fraction of common support of the wavelet coefficients of consecutive ECG segments. Experimental results utilizing the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database show that significant performance gains, in terms of compression rate and reconstruction quality, can be obtained by the proposed algorithms compared to current CS-based methods."

The thesis aims to extend PLP to support both discrete and continuous random variables, which is necessary for applications with numeric data. The first contribution is the introduction of context-specific likelihood weighting (CS-LW), a new sampling algorithm that exploits context-specific independencies for computational gains. Next, a new hybrid PLP, DC#, is introduced, which integrates the syntax of Distributional Clauses with Bayesian logic programs and represents three types of independencies: i) conditional independencies (CIs) modeled in Bayesian networks; ii) context-specific independencies (CSIs) represented by logical rules, and iii) independencies amongst attributes of related objects in relational models expressed by combining rules. The scalable inference algorithm FO-CS-LW is introduced for DC#. Finally, the thesis addresses the lack of approaches for learning hybrid PLP from relational data with missing values and (probabilistic) background knowledge with the introduction of DiceML, which learns the structure and parameters of hybrid PLP and tackles the relational autocompletion problem. The conclusion discusses future directions and open challenges for hybrid PLP."

    "title": "Transformer Compressed Sensing via Global Image Tokens",
    "summary": "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have demonstrated outstanding Compressed Sensing (CS) performance compared to traditional, hand-crafted methods. However, they are broadly limited in terms of generalisability, inductive bias and difficulty to model long distance relationships. Transformer neural networks (TNN) overcome such issues by implementing an attention mechanism designed to capture dependencies between inputs. However, high-resolution tasks typically require vision Transformers (ViT) to decompose an image into patch-based tokens, limiting inputs to inherently local contexts. We propose a novel image decomposition that naturally embeds images into low-resolution inputs. These Kaleidoscope tokens (KD) provide a mechanism for global attention, at the same computational cost as a patch-based approach. To showcase this development, we replace CNN components in a well-known CS-MRI neural network with TNN blocks and demonstrate the improvements afforded by KD. We also propose an ensemble of image tokens, which enhance overall image quality and reduces model size. Supplementary material is available: https://github.com/uqmarlonbran/TCS.git"

An analysis of the effects related to the measurements quantization with an arbitrary number of bits is the topic of this paper. A unified mathematical model for the analysis of the quantization noise and the signal nonsparsity on the CS reconstruction is presented. An exact formula for the expected energy of error in the CS-based reconstructed signal is derived. The theory is validated through various numerical examples with quantized measurements, including the cases of approximately sparse signals, noise folding, and floating-point arithmetics."

The compressive sensing matrices can be shown to offer asymptotically optimal performance when used in combination with Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) methods.

Fortunately, high-dimensional covariance matrices as observed in text, click-through, meta-genomics datasets, etc are often sparse. In this paper, we consider the problem of efficient sparse estimation of covariance matrices with possibly trillions of entries. The size of the datasets we target requires the algorithm to be online, as more than one pass over the data is prohibitive. In this paper, we propose Active Sampling Count Sketch (ASCS), an online and one-pass sketching algorithm, that recovers the large entries of the covariance matrix accurately. Count Sketch (CS), and other sub-linear compressed sensing algorithms, offer a natural solution to the problem in theory. However, vanilla CS does not work well in practice due to a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). At the heart of our approach is a novel active sampling strategy that increases the SNR of classical CS. We demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm with synthetic data and real-world high dimensional datasets. ASCS significantly improves over vanilla CS, demonstrating the merit of our active sampling strategy."

However, most existing DUNs solely rely on the image-domain unfolding, which restricts the information transmission capacity and reconstruction flexibility, leading to their loss of image details and unsatisfactory performance. To overcome these limitations, this paper develops a dual-domain optimization framework that combines the priors of (1) image- and (2) convolutional-coding-domains and offers generality to CS and other inverse imaging tasks. By converting this optimization framework into deep NN structures, we present a Dual-Domain Deep Convolutional Coding Network (D3C2-Net), which enjoys the ability to efficiently transmit high-capacity self-adaptive convolutional features across all its unfolded stages. Our theoretical analyses and experiments on simulated and real captured data, covering 2D and 3D natural, medical, and scientific signals, demonstrate the effectiveness, practicality, superior performance, and generalization ability of our method over other competing approaches and its significant potential in achieving a balance among accuracy, complexity, and interpretability.

On a discrete angular grid, the CS reconstruction degrades due to basis mismatch when the DOAs do not coincide with the angular directions on the grid. To overcome this limitation, a continuous formulation of the DOA problem is employed and an optimization procedure is introduced, which promotes sparsity on a continuous optimization variable. The DOA estimation problem with infinitely many unknowns, i.e., source locations and amplitudes, is solved over a few optimization variables with semidefinite programming. The grid-free CS reconstruction provides high-resolution imaging even with non-uniform arrays, single-snapshot data and under noisy conditions as demonstrated on experimental towed array data."

Compressive sensing (CS) has found wide-ranging applications in image acquisition and reconstruction. Recently, numerous deep-learning methods have been introduced for CS tasks. However, the accurate reconstruction of images from measurements remains a significant challenge, especially at low sampling rates. In this paper, we propose Uformer-ICS as a novel U-shaped transformer for image CS tasks by introducing inner characteristics of CS into transformer architecture. To utilize the uneven sparsity distribution of image blocks, we design an adaptive sampling architecture that allocates measurement resources based on the estimated block sparsity, allowing the compressed results to retain maximum information from the original image. Additionally, we introduce a multi-channel projection (MCP) module inspired by traditional CS optimization methods. By integrating the MCP module into the transformer blocks, we construct projection-based transformer blocks, and then form a symmetrical reconstruction model using these blocks and residual convolutional blocks. Therefore, our reconstruction model can simultaneously utilize the local features and long-range dependencies of image, and the prior projection knowledge of CS theory. Experimental results demonstrate its significantly better reconstruction performance than state-of-the-art deep learning-based CS methods."

Super-resolution techniques can obtain high-resolution MRI images. The traditional methods obtained the resolution enhancement of brain MRI by interpolations, affecting the accuracy of the following diagnose process. The requirement for brain image quality is fast increasing. In this paper, we propose an image super-resolution (SR) method based on overcomplete dictionaries and inherent similarity of an image to recover the high-resolution (HR) image from a single low-resolution (LR) image. We explore the nonlocal similarity of the image to tentatively search for similar blocks in the whole image and present a joint reconstruction method based on compressive sensing (CS) and similarity constraints. The sparsity and self-similarity of the image blocks are taken as the constraints. The proposed method is summarized in the following steps. First, a dictionary classification method based on the measurement domain is presented. The image blocks are classified into smooth, texture and edge parts by analyzing their features in the measurement domain. Then, the corresponding dictionaries are trained using the classified image blocks. Equally important, in the reconstruction part, we use the CS reconstruction method to recover the HR brain MRI image, considering both nonlocal similarity and the sparsity of an image as the constraints. This method performs better both visually and quantitatively than some existing methods."

Despite delivering remarkable rendering quality and speed, existing methods struggle with storage demands and representing complex real-world motions. To tackle these issues, we propose MoDecGS, a memory-efficient Gaussian splatting framework designed for reconstructing novel views in challenging scenarios with complex motions. We introduce GlobaltoLocal Motion Decomposition (GLMD) to effectively capture dynamic motions in a coarsetofine manner. This approach leverages Global Canonical Scaffolds (Global CS) and Local Canonical Scaffolds (Local CS), extending static Scaffold representation to dynamic video reconstruction. For Global CS, we propose Global Anchor Deformation (GAD) to efficiently represent global dynamics along complex motions, by directly deforming the implicit Scaffold attributes which are anchor position, offset, and local context features. Next, we finely adjust local motions via the Local Gaussian Deformation (LGD) of Local CS explicitly. Additionally, we introduce Temporal Interval Adjustment (TIA) to automatically control the temporal coverage of each Local CS during training, allowing MoDecGS to find optimal interval assignments based on the specified number of temporal segments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MoDecGS achieves an average 70% reduction in model size over stateoftheart methods for dynamic 3D Gaussians from realworld dynamic videos while maintaining or even improving rendering quality."

Automatically generating appealing titles and covers for short videos can help grab viewers' attention. Existing studies on video captioning mostly focus on generating factual descriptions of actions, which do not conform to video titles intended for catching viewer attention. Furthermore, research for cover selection based on multimodal information is sparse. These problems motivate the need for tailored methods to specifically support the joint task of short video title generation and cover selection (TG-CS) as well as the demand for creating corresponding datasets to support the studies. In this paper, we first collect and present a real-world dataset named Short Video Title Generation (SVTG) that contains videos with appealing titles and covers. We then propose a Title generation and Cover selection with attention Refinement (TCR) method for TG-CS. The refinement procedure progressively selects high-quality samples and highly relevant frames and text tokens within each sample to refine model training. Extensive experiments show that our TCR method is superior to various existing video captioning methods in generating titles and is able to select better covers for noisy real-world short videos."

Aiming to find the topics that will trend in CS area, we innovatively formalize a hot topic prediction problem where, with joint consideration of both inter- and intra-topical influence, 17 different scientific features are extracted for comprehensive description of topic status. By leveraging all those 17 features, we observe good accuracy of topic scale forecasting after 5 and 10 years with R2 values of 0.9893 and 0.9646, respectively. Interestingly, our prediction suggests that the maximum value matters in finding hot topics in scholarly fields, primarily from three aspects: (1) the maximum value of each factor, such as authors' maximum h-index and largest citation number, provides three times the amount of information than the average value in prediction; (2) the mutual influence between the most correlated topics serve as the most telling factor in long-term topic trend prediction, interpreting that those currently exhibiting the maximum growth rates will drive the correlated topics to be hot in the future; (3) we predict in the next 5 years the top 100 fastest growing (maximum growth rate) topics that will potentially get the major attention in CS area."

The resulting CS regularizers are simple, differentiable, and can be free of spurious stationary points, making them suitable for gradient-based solvers and large-scale optimization problems. In addition, CS regularizers automatically adapt to the appropriate scale, which is, for example, beneficial when discretizing the weights of neural networks. To demonstrate the efficacy of CS regularizers, we provide results for solving underdetermined systems of linear equations and weight quantization in neural networks. Furthermore, we discuss specializations, variations, and generalizations, which lead to an even broader class of new and possibly more powerful regularizers."

    "title": "A Deep Error Correction Network for Compressed Sensing MRI",
    "summary": "Compressed sensing for magnetic resonance imaging (CS-MRI) exploits image sparsity properties to reconstruct MRI from very few Fourier k-space measurements. The goal is to minimize any structural errors in the reconstruction that could have a negative impact on its diagnostic quality. To this end, we propose a deep error correction network (DECN) for CS-MRI. The DECN model consists of three parts, which we refer to as modules: a guide, or template, module, an error correction module, and a data fidelity module. Existing CS-MRI algorithms can serve as the template module for guiding the reconstruction. Using this template as a guide, the error correction module learns a convolutional neural network (CNN) to map the k-space data in a way that adjusts for the reconstruction error of the template image. Our experimental results show the proposed DECN CS-MRI reconstruction framework can considerably improve upon existing inversion algorithms by supplementing with an error-correcting CNN."

    "title": "Grant-Free Coexistence of Critical and Non-Critical IoT Services in Two-Hop Satellite and Terrestrial Networks",
    "summary": "Terrestrial and satellite communication networks often rely on two-hop wireless architectures with an access channel followed by backhaul links. Examples include Cloud-Radio Access Networks (C-RAN) and Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite systems. Furthermore, communication services characterized by the coexistence of heterogeneous requirements are emerging as key use cases. This paper studies the performance of critical service (CS) and non-critical service (NCS) for Internet of Things (IoT) systems sharing a grant-free channel consisting of radio access and backhaul segments. On the radio access segment, IoT devices send packets to a set of non-cooperative access points (APs) using slotted ALOHA (SA). The APs then forward correctly received messages to a base station over a shared wireless backhaul segment adopting SA. We study first a simplified erasure channel model, which is well suited for satellite applications. Then, in order to account for terrestrial scenarios, the impact of fading is considered. Among the main conclusions, we show that orthogonal inter-service resource allocation is generally preferred for NCS devices, while non-orthogonal protocols can improve the throughput and packet success rate of CS devices for both terrestrial and satellite scenarios."

    "summary": "Cloud-assisted image services are widely used for various applications. Due to the high computational complexity of existing image encryption technology, it is extremely challenging to provide privacy preserving image services for resource-constrained smart device. In this paper, we propose a novel encrypressive cloud-assisted image service scheme, called eCIS. The key idea of eCIS is to shift the high computational cost to the cloud allowing reduction in complexity of encoder and decoder on resource-constrained device. This is done via compressive sensing (CS) techniques, compared with existing approaches, we are able to achieve privacy protection at no additional transmission cost. In particular, we design an encryption matrix by taking care of image compression and encryption simultaneously. Such that, the goal of our design is to minimize the mutual information of original image and encrypted image. In addition to the theoretical analysis that demonstrates the security properties and complexity of our system, we also conduct extensive experiment to evaluate its performance. The experiment results show that eCIS can effectively protect image privacy and meet the user's adaptive secure demand. eCIS reduced the system overheads by up to compared with the existing CS based image processing approach."

    "title": "Compressed sensing with structured sparsity and structured acquisition",
    "summary": "Compressed Sensing (CS) is an appealing framework for applications such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, up-to-date, the sensing schemes suggested by CS theories are made of random isolated measurements, which are usually incompatible with the physics of acquisition. To reflect the physical constraints of the imaging device, we introduce the notion of blocks of measurements: the sensing scheme is not a set of isolated measurements anymore, but a set of groups of measurements which may represent any arbitrary shape (parallel or radial lines for instance). Structured acquisition with blocks of measurements are easy to implement, and provide good reconstruction results in practice. However, very few results exist on the theoretical guarantees of CS reconstructions in this setting. In this paper, we derive new CS results for structured acquisitions and signals satisfying a prior structured sparsity. The obtained results provide a recovery probability of sparse vectors that explicitly depends on their support. Our results are thus support-dependent and offer the possibility for flexible assumptions on the sparsity structure. Moreover, the results are drawing-dependent, since we highlight an explicit dependency between the probability of reconstructing a sparse vector and the way of choosing the blocks of measurements. Numerical simulations show that the proposed theory is faithful to experimental observations."

Integrating live polling activities has been shown to boost attention, participation, and understanding of course materials. However, recent changes in learning behaviours due to the pandemic necessitate a reevaluation of these active learning technologies. In this context, our study focuses on the Computer Science (CS) domain, investigating the impact of Live Polling Quizzes (LPQs) in undergraduate CS lectures. These quizzes comprise fact-based, formally defined questions with clear answers, aiming to enhance engagement, learning outcomes, and overall perceptions of the course module. A survey was conducted among 70 undergraduate CS students, attending CS modules with and without LPQs. The results revealed that while LPQs contributed to higher attendance, other factors likely influenced attendance rates more significantly. LPQs were generally viewed positively, aiding comprehension and maintaining student attention and motivation. However, careful management of LPQ frequency is crucial to prevent overuse for some students and potential reduced motivation. Clear instructions for using the polling software were also highlighted as essential."

    "title": "From Denoising to Compressed Sensing",
    "summary": "A denoising algorithm seeks to remove noise, errors, or perturbations from a signal. Extensive research has been devoted to this arena over the last several decades, and as a result, today's denoisers can effectively remove large amounts of additive white Gaussian noise. A compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction algorithm seeks to recover a structured signal acquired using a small number of randomized measurements. Typical CS reconstruction algorithms can be cast as iteratively estimating a signal from a perturbed observation. This paper answers a natural question: How can one effectively employ a generic denoiser in a CS reconstruction algorithm? In response, we develop an extension of the approximate message passing (AMP) framework, called Denoising-based AMP (D-AMP), that can integrate a wide class of denoisers within its iterations. We demonstrate that, when used with a high performance denoiser for natural images, D-AMP offers state-of-the-art CS recovery performance while operating tens of times faster than competing methods. We explain the exceptional performance of D-AMP by analyzing some of its theoretical features. A key element in D-AMP is the use of an appropriate Onsager correction term in its iterations, which coerces the signal perturbation at each iteration to be very close to the white Gaussian noise that denoisers are typically designed to remove."

Currently, it is estimated that CS has been adapted to over 60 languages; however, no official CS system is available for Mandarin Chinese. This article proposes a novel and efficient Mandarin Chinese CS system, satisfying the main criterion that the hand coding constitutes a complement to the lips movements. We propose to code vowels [i, u, y] as semiconsonants when they are followed by other Mandarin finals, which reduces the number of Mandarin finals to be coded from 36 to 16. We establish a coherent similarity between Mandarin Chinese and French vowels for the remaining 16 vowels, which allows us to take advantage of the French CS system. Furthermore, by investigating the lips viseme distribution based on a new corpus, an optimal allocation of the 16 Mandarin vowels to different hand positions is obtained. A Gaussian classifier was used to evaluate the average separability of different allocated vowel groups, which gives 92.08\\%, 92.33\\%, and 92.73\\% for the three speakers, respectively. The consonants are mainly designed according to their similarities with the French CS system, as well as some considerations on the special Mandarin consonants. In our system, the tones of Mandarin are coded with head movements."

Our first method utilizes extra cross-validation measurements, and the second one exploits extra low-resolution measurements. Unlike the majority of current CS techniques, we do not assume that we know an upper bound on the number of significant coefficients that comprise the images in the video sequence. Instead, we use the side information to predict the number of significant coefficients in the signal at the next time instant. For each image in the video sequence, our techniques specify a fixed number of spatially-multiplexed CS measurements to acquire, and adjust this quantity from image to image. Our strategies are developed in the specific context of background subtraction for surveillance video, and we experimentally validate the proposed methods on real video sequences."

    "summary": "Cued Speech (CS) is an innovative visual communication system that integrates lip-reading with hand coding, designed to enhance effective communication for individuals with hearing impairments. Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) refers to the AI-driven process of automatically recognizing hand gestures and lip movements in CS, converting them into text. However, previous work often relies on complex fusion modules and training techniques. Additionally, due to the limited amount of data in CS, the extraction of hand features, as well as recognition modeling, has consistently been subpar, significantly limiting the effectiveness of ACSR. To address this issue, we have innovatively explored the capabilities of Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in recognizing hand shapes and positions in CS. More precisely, we propose a new Semi Training-Free paradigm for ACSR, named STF-ACSR. This approach leverages zero-shot recognition of hand movements through the Chinese CS Prompt Module (CCSPM), which equipped a training-free keyframe filtering and customized prompt engineering based on MLLM. It then integrates the recognition results into the lip-reading model using a Minimalist Fusion Module (MFM), effectively achieving superior recognition results. Furthermore, specifically for this study, we have supplemented the existing dataset of 6 normal hearing CS cuers by recording additional data from 8 cuers with hearing impairments, resulting in a new mixed dataset. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that STF-ACSR significantly outperforms previous methods on both normal and hearing-impaired data. Implementation and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/DennisHgj/STF_ACSR."

The paper then presents an overview of the results and system performance in the three tracks. It turns out that traditional ASR system benefits from pronunciation lexicon, CS text generating and data augmentation.

    "summary": "Accurately assessing the risk of cesarean section (CS) delivery is critical, especially in settings with limited medical resources, where access to healthcare is often restricted. Early and reliable risk prediction allows better-informed prenatal care decisions and can improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, most existing predictive models are tailored for in-hospital use during labor and rely on parameters that are often unavailable in resource-limited or home-based settings. In this study, we conduct a pilot investigation to examine the feasibility of using 3D body shape for CS risk assessment for future applications with more affordable general devices. We propose a novel multi-view-based Transformer network, MvBody, which predicts CS risk using only self-reported medical data and 3D optical body scans obtained between the 31st and 38th weeks of gestation. To enhance training efficiency and model generalizability in data-scarce environments, we incorporate a metric learning loss into the network. Compared to widely used machine learning models and the latest advanced 3D analysis methods, our method demonstrates superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 84.62% and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.724 on the independent test set. To improve transparency and trust in the model's predictions, we apply the Integrated Gradients algorithm to provide theoretically grounded explanations of the model's decision-making process. Our results indicate that pre-pregnancy weight, maternal age, obstetric history, previous CS history, and body shape, particularly around the head and shoulders, are key contributors to CS risk prediction."

We introduce a neural machine translation (NMT) model that maps a source character sequence to a target character sequence without any segmentation. We employ a character-level convolutional network with max-pooling at the encoder to reduce the length of source representation, allowing the model to be trained at a speed comparable to subword-level models while capturing local regularities. Our character-to-character model outperforms a recently proposed baseline with a subword-level encoder on WMT'15 DE-EN and CS-EN, and gives comparable performance on FI-EN and RU-EN. We then demonstrate that it is possible to share a single character-level encoder across multiple languages by training a model on a many-to-one translation task. In this multilingual setting, the character-level encoder significantly outperforms the subword-level encoder on all the language pairs. We observe that on CS-EN, FI-EN and RU-EN, the quality of the multilingual character-level translation even surpasses the models specifically trained on that language pair alone, both in terms of BLEU score and human judgment."

The nature of this feedback varies significantly, contingent on the subject and the chosen evaluation method. However, tailoring current Automated Assessment Tools (AATs) to integrate other program analysis tools is not straightforward. Moreover, AATs usually support only specific programming languages, providing feedback exclusively through dedicated websites based on test suites. This paper introduces GitSEED, a language-agnostic automated assessment tool designed for Programming Education and Software Engineering (SE) and backed by GitLab. The students interact with GitSEED through GitLab. Using GitSEED, students in Computer Science (CS) and SE can master the fundamentals of git while receiving personalized feedback on their programming assignments and projects. Furthermore, faculty members can easily tailor GitSEED's pipeline by integrating various code evaluation tools (e.g., memory leak detection, fault localization, program repair, etc.) to offer personalized feedback that aligns with the needs of each CS/SE course. Our experiments assess GitSEED's efficacy via comprehensive user evaluation, examining the impact of feedback mechanisms and features on student learning outcomes. Findings reveal positive correlations between GitSEED usage and student engagement."

Channel feedback for massive MIMO is challenging due to the substantially increased dimension of MIMO channel matrix. In this letter, we propose a compressive sensing (CS) based differential channel feedback scheme to reduce the feedback overhead. Specifically, the temporal correlation of time-varying channels is exploited to generate the differential channel impulse response (CIR) between two CIRs in neighboring time slots, which enjoys a much stronger sparsity than the original sparse CIRs. Thus, the base station can recover the differential CIR from the highly compressed differential CIR under the framework of CS theory. Simulations show that the proposed scheme reduces the feedback overhead by about 20\\% compared with the direct CS-based scheme."

They have long been catalogued with corresponding mitigating solutions called refactoring operations. Objective: This SLR has a twofold goal: the first is to identify the main code smells detection techniques and tools discussed in the literature, and the second is to analyze to which extent visual techniques have been applied to support the former. Method: Over 83 primary studies indexed in major scientific repositories were identified by our search string in this SLR. Then, following existing best practices for secondary studies, we applied inclusion/exclusion criteria to select the most relevant works, extract their features and classify them. Results: We found that the most commonly used approaches to code smells detection are search-based (30.1%), and metric-based (24.1%). Most of the studies (83.1%) use open-source software, with the Java language occupying the first position (77.1%). In terms of code smells, God Class (51.8%), Feature Envy (33.7%), and Long Method (26.5%) are the most covered ones. Machine learning techniques are used in 35% of the studies. Around 80% of the studies only detect code smells, without providing visualization techniques. In visualization-based approaches several methods are used, such as: city metaphors, 3D visualization techniques. Conclusions: We confirm that the detection of CS is a non trivial task, and there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of: reducing the subjectivity associated with the definition and detection of CS; increasing the diversity of detected CS and of supported programming languages; constructing and sharing oracles and datasets to facilitate the replication of CS detection and visualization techniques validation experiments."

This task combines two conventional few-shot learning problems, few-shot classification and segmentation. FS-CS generalizes them to more realistic episodes with arbitrary image pairs, where each target class may or may not be present in the query. To address the task, we propose the integrative few-shot learning (iFSL) framework for FS-CS, which trains a learner to construct class-wise foreground maps for multi-label classification and pixel-wise segmentation. We also develop an effective iFSL model, attentive squeeze network (ASNet), that leverages deep semantic correlation and global self-attention to produce reliable foreground maps. In experiments, the proposed method shows promising performance on the FS-CS task and also achieves the state of the art on standard few-shot segmentation benchmarks."

To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end flexible ISTA-unfolding deep network, dubbed ISTA-Net++, with superior performance and strong flexibility. Specifically, by developing a dynamic unfolding strategy, our model enjoys the adaptability of handling CS problems with different ratios, i.e., multi-ratio tasks, through a single model. A cross-block strategy is further utilized to reduce blocking artifacts and enhance the CS recovery quality. Furthermore, we adopt a balanced dataset for training, which brings more robustness when reconstructing images of multiple scenes. Extensive experiments on four datasets show that ISTA-Net++ achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality. Considering its flexibility, effectiveness and practicability, our model is expected to serve as a suitable baseline in future CS research.

However, in many cases of interest the memory of the channel prohibits application of the VA. A popular and conceptually simple method in this case, studied since the early 70s, is to first filter the received signal in order to shorten the memory of the channel, and then to apply a VA that operates with the shorter memory. We shall refer to this as a channel shortening (CS) receiver. Although studied for almost four decades, an information theoretic understanding of what such a simple receiver solution is actually doing is not available. In this paper we will show that an optimized CS receiver is implementing the chain rule of mutual information, but only up to the shortened memory that the receiver is operating with. Further, we will show that the tools for analyzing the ensuing achievable rates from an optimized CS receiver are precisely the same as those used for analyzing the achievable rates of a minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver."

However, many reconstruction algorithms have high computational costs. To address this, we investigate deep residual learning networks to remove aliasing artifacts from artifact corrupted images. The proposed deep residual learning networks are composed of magnitude and phase networks that are separately trained. If both phase and magnitude information are available, the proposed algorithm can work as an iterative k-space interpolation algorithm using framelet representation. When only magnitude data is available, the proposed approach works as an image domain post-processing algorithm. Even with strong coherent aliasing artifacts, the proposed network successfully learned and removed the aliasing artifacts, whereas current parallel and CS reconstruction methods were unable to remove these artifacts. Comparisons using single and multiple coil show that the proposed residual network provides good reconstruction results with orders of magnitude faster computational time than existing compressed sensing methods. The proposed deep learning framework may have a great potential for accelerated MR reconstruction by generating accurate results immediately."

Contextual Sparsity (CS) is appealing for its training-free nature and its ability to reach a higher compression ratio seemingly without quality degradation. However, after a comprehensive evaluation of contextual sparsity methods on various complex generation tasks, we find that although CS succeeds in prompt-understanding tasks, CS significantly degrades the model performance for reasoning, deduction, and knowledge-based tasks. Despite the gap in end-to-end accuracy, we observed that sparse models often share general problem-solving logic and require only a few token corrections to recover the original model performance. This paper introduces Sirius, an efficient correction mechanism, which significantly recovers CS models quality on reasoning tasks while maintaining its efficiency gain. Sirius is evaluated on 6 models with 8 difficult generation tasks in reasoning, math, and coding and shows consistent effectiveness and efficiency. Also, we carefully develop a system implementation for Sirius and show that Sirius achieves roughly 20% reduction in latency for 8B model on-chip and 35% reduction for 70B model offloading.

The secret key is generated via a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) and XORed with the measurements to be inserted. For insertion, we use a reversible data hiding (RDH) scheme, which is a prediction error expansion algorithm, modified to match the statistics of CS measurements. The reconstruction from the embedded stream conducts to visibly distorted images. The image distortion is controlled by the number of embedded levels. In our tests, the embedding on 10 levels results in distortion for images of 256x256 pixels reconstructed with the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA). A particularity of the presented method is on-the-fly insertion that makes it appropriate for the sequential acquisition of measurements by a Single Pixel Camera. On-the-fly insertion avoids the buffering of CS measurements for a subsequent standard encryption and generation of a thumbnail image."

With in-depth analysis, we first show that naively trained dense retrievers heavily exploit the shortcut and hence perform poorly when asked to answer history-independent questions. To build more robust models against shortcut dependency, we explore various hard negative mining strategies. Experimental results show that training with the model-based hard negatives effectively mitigates the dependency on the shortcut, significantly improving dense retrievers on recent CS benchmarks. In particular, our retriever outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 11.0 in Recall@10 on QReCC."

Except for providing text-based answers, the VQLA system can highlight the interested region for better surgical scene understanding. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning new knowledge. Specifically, when DNNs learn on incremental classes or tasks, their performance on old tasks drops dramatically. Furthermore, due to medical data privacy and licensing issues, it is often difficult to access old data when updating continual learning (CL) models. Therefore, we develop a non-exemplar continual surgical VQLA framework, to explore and balance the rigidity-plasticity trade-off of DNNs in a sequential learning paradigm. We revisit the distillation loss in CL tasks, and propose rigidity-plasticity-aware distillation (RP-Dist) and self-calibrated heterogeneous distillation (SH-Dist) to preserve the old knowledge. The weight aligning (WA) technique is also integrated to adjust the weight bias between old and new tasks. We further establish a CL framework on three public surgical datasets in the context of surgical settings that consist of overlapping classes between old and new surgical VQLA tasks. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method excellently reconciles learning and forgetting on the continual surgical VQLA over conventional CL methods.

    "title": "Compressed sensing performance bounds under Poisson noise",
    "summary": "This paper describes performance bounds for compressed sensing (CS) where the underlying sparse or compressible (sparsely approximable) signal is a vector of nonnegative intensities whose measurements are corrupted by Poisson noise. In this setting, standard CS techniques cannot be applied directly for several reasons. First, the usual signal-independent and/or bounded noise models do not apply to Poisson noise, which is non-additive and signal-dependent. Second, the CS matrices typically considered are not feasible in real optical systems because they do not adhere to important constraints, such as nonnegativity and photon flux preservation. Third, the typical -- minimization leads to overfitting in the high-intensity regions and oversmoothing in the low-intensity areas. In this paper, we describe how a feasible positivity- and flux-preserving sensing matrix can be constructed, and then analyze the performance of a CS reconstruction approach for Poisson data that minimizes an objective function consisting of a negative Poisson log likelihood term and a penalty term which measures signal sparsity. We show that, as the overall intensity of the underlying signal increases, an upper bound on the reconstruction error decays at an appropriate rate (depending on the compressibility of the signal), but that for a fixed signal intensity, the signal-dependent part of the error bound actually grows with the number of measurements or sensors. This surprising fact is both proved theoretically and justified based on physical intuition."

    "title": "Structure-Constrained Basis Pursuit for Compressed Sensing",
    "summary": "In compressive sensing (CS) theory, as the number of samples is decreased below a minimum threshold, the average error of the recovery increases. Sufficient sampling is either required for quality reconstruction or the error is resignedly accepted. However, most CS work has not taken advantage of the inherent structure in a variety of signals relevant to engineering applications. Hence, this paper proposes a new method of recovery built on basis pursuit (BP), called Structure-Constrained Basis Pursuit (SCBP), that constrains signals based on known structure rather than through extra sampling. Preliminary assessments of this method on TIMIT recordings of the speech phoneme /aa/ show a substantial decrease in error: with a fixed 5:1 compression ratio the average recovery error is 23.8% lower versus vanilla BP. More significantly, this method can be applied to any CS application that samples structured data, such as FSK waveforms, speech, and tones. In these cases, higher compression ratios can be reached with comparable error."

    "summary": "Code-switching (CS), i.e. mixing different languages in a single sentence, is a common phenomenon in communication and can be challenging in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) settings. Previous studies on CS speech have shown promising results for end-to-end speech translation (ST), but have been limited to offline scenarios and to translation to one of the languages present in the source ( monolingual transcription ). In this paper, we focus on two essential yet unexplored areas for real-world CS speech translation: streaming settings, and translation to a third language (i.e., a language not included in the source). To this end, we extend the Fisher and Miami test and validation datasets to include new targets in Spanish and German. Using this data, we train a model for both offline and streaming ST and we establish baseline results for the two settings mentioned earlier."

We first formulate this joint detection problem as a maximum likelihood estimation problem, which depends on the received signal only through its sample covariance, and then propose efficient coordinate descent type of algorithms to solve the formulated problem. Our proposed covariance-based approach is sharply different from the existing compressed sensing (CS) approach for the same problem. Numerical results show that our proposed covariance-based approach significantly outperforms the CS approach in terms of the detection performance since our proposed approach can make better use of the BS antennas than the CS approach."

    "title": "Analyzing Cross Validation In Compressed Sensing With Mixed Gaussian And Impulse Measurement Noise With L1 Errors",
    "summary": "Compressed sensing (CS) involves sampling signals at rates less than their Nyquist rates and attempting to reconstruct them after sample acquisition. Most such algorithms have parameters, for example the regularization parameter in LASSO, which need to be chosen carefully for optimal performance. These parameters can be chosen based on assumptions on the noise level or signal sparsity, but this knowledge may often be unavailable. In such cases, cross validation (CV) can be used to choose these parameters in a purely data-driven fashion. Previous work analysing the use of CV in CS has been based on the cross-validation error with Gaussian measurement noise. But it is well known that the error is not robust to impulse noise and provides a poor estimate of the recovery error, failing to choose the best parameter. Here we propose using the CV error which provides substantial performance benefits given impulse measurement noise. Most importantly, we provide a detailed theoretical analysis and error bounds for the use of CV error in CS reconstruction. We show that with high probability, choosing the parameter that yields the minimum CV error is equivalent to choosing the minimum recovery error (which is not observable in practice). To our best knowledge, this is the first paper which theoretically analyzes -based CV in CS."

    "summary": "In recent years, compressed sensing (CS) has been applied in the field of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging and shows great potential. The existing models are, however, based on application of the sensing matrix acquired by the exact observation functions. As a result, the corresponding reconstruction algorithms are much more time consuming than traditional matched filter (MF) based focusing methods, especially in high resolution and wide swath systems. In this paper, we formulate a new CS-SAR imaging model based on the use of the approximated SAR observation deducted from the inverse of focusing procedures. We incorporate CS and MF within an sparse regularization framework that is then solved by a fast iterative thresholding algorithm. The proposed model forms a new CS-SAR imaging method that can be applied to high-quality and high-resolution imaging under sub-Nyquist rate sampling, while saving the computational cost substantially both in time and memory. Simulations and real SAR data applications support that the proposed method can perform SAR imaging effectively and efficiently under Nyquist rate, especially for large scale applications."

    "summary": "Millimeter wave (mmWave) full-duplex (FD) is a promising technique for improving capacity by maximizing the utilization of both time and the rich mmWave frequency resources. Still, it has restrictions due to FD self-interference (SI) and mmWave's limited coverage. Therefore, this study dives into FD mmWave MIMO with the assistance of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for capacity improvement. First, we demonstrate the angular-domain reciprocity of FD antenna arrays under the far-field planar wavefront assumption. Accordingly, a strategy for joint downlink-uplink (DL-UL) channel estimation is presented. For estimating the SI channel, the direct channel, and the cascaded channel, the Khatri-Rao product-based compressive sensing (KR-CS), distributed CS (D-CS), and two-stage multiple measurement vector-based D-CS (M-D-CS) frameworks are proposed, respectively. Additionally, we propose a passive beamforming optimization solution based on the angular-domain cascaded channel. With hybrid beamforming architectures, a novel hybrid weighted minimum mean squared error method for SI cancellation (H-WMMSE-SIC) is proposed. Simulations have revealed that joint DL-UL processing significantly improves estimation performance in comparison to separate DL/UL channel estimation. Particularly, when the interference-to-noise ratio is less than 35 dB, our proposed H-WMMSE-SIC offers spectral efficiency performance comparable to fully-digital WMMSE-SIC. Finally, the computational complexity is analyzed for our proposed methods."

The existing sketching methods, such as count sketch (CS), tensor sketch (TS), and higher-order count sketch (HCS), either suffer from low accuracy or slow speed in some tensor based applications. In this paper, the proposed fast count sketch (FCS) applies multiple shorter Hash functions based CS to the vector form of the input tensor, which is more accurate than TS since the spatial information of the input tensor can be preserved more sufficiently. When the input tensor admits CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD), FCS can accelerate CS and HCS by using fast Fourier transform, which exhibits a computational complexity asymptotically identical to TS for low-order tensors. The effectiveness of FCS is validated by CPD, tensor regression network compression, and Kronecker product compression. Experimental results show its superior performance in terms of approximation accuracy and computational efficiency."

Our HI image is sensitive to 1.4 x 10 cm over 44.1 km s , where we detect HI in 10 galaxies and a total of 1.12 x 10 Msol of HI in the intra-group medium (IGM). We search for signs of pre-processing in the 12 group galaxies with confirmed optical redshifts that reside within our HI image. There are 9 galaxies that show evidence of pre-processing and we classify the pre-processing status of each galaxy, according to their HI morphology and gas (atomic and molecular) scaling relations. Galaxies yet to experience pre-processing have extended HI disks, a high HI content with a H -to-HI ratio an order of magnitude lower than the median for their stellar mass. Galaxies currently being pre-processed display HI tails, truncated HI disks with typical gas ratios. Galaxies in the advanced stages of pre-processing are HI deficient. If there is any HI, they have lost their outer HI disk and efficiently converted their HI to H , resulting in H -to-HI ratios an order of magnitude higher than the median for their stellar mass. The central, massive galaxy in our group underwent a 10:1 merger 2 Gyr ago, and ejected 6.6 - 11.2 x 10 Msol of HI that we detect as clouds and streams in the IGM, some forming coherent structures up to 220 kpc in length. We also detect giant (100 kpc) ionised hydrogen (H ) filaments in the IGM, likely from cool gas being removed (and ionised) from an infalling satellite. The H filaments are situated within the hot halo of NGC 1316 and some regions contain HI. We speculate that the H and multiphase gas is supported by magnetic pressure (possibly assisted by the AGN), such that the hot gas can condense and form HI that survives in the hot halo for cosmological timescales."

    "summary": "The surging demand for fresh information from various Internet of Things (IoT) applications requires oceans of data sampled from the physical environment to be transmitted and processed timely, which would lead to huge energy consumption. We investigate the sleep-wake strategies of servers in communication systems to reduce energy consumption while guaranteeing timely delivery of fresh information to users. Specifically, we investigate a multi-source single-server queueing system and propose a novel sleep-wake strategy called the Conditional Sleep (CS) scheme. Our analysis reveals that the CS scheme outperforms the widely-used Hysteresis Time (HT) and Bernoulli Sleep (BS) schemes in terms of Age of Information (AoI), while retaining the same energy consumption rate and Peak Age of Information (PAoI). We find that increasing the sleep period length leads to a reduction in energy consumption and an increase in PAoI, but it does not always increase AoI. Moreover, we show that using PAoI as the information freshness metric in designing sleep-wake strategies would make the server sleep infinitely long due to the PAoI being determined by first-order statistics. We further numerically show that having the bufferless system can achieve a better PAoI-energy tradeoff than the infinite buffer system when having a large sampling rate."

This impedes both academic research and practical deployment, since researchers and stakeholders require deeper insights into NCO models. In this paper, we take the first critical step towards interpreting NCO models by investigating their representations through various probing tasks. Moreover, we introduce a novel probing tool named Coefficient Significance Probing (CS-Probing) to enable deeper analysis of NCO representations by examining the coefficients and statistical significance during probing. Extensive experiments and analysis reveal that NCO models encode low-level information essential for solution construction, while capturing high-level knowledge to facilitate better decisions. Using CS-Probing, we find that prevalent NCO models impose varying inductive biases on their learned representations, uncover direct evidence related to model generalization, and identify key embedding dimensions associated with specific knowledge. These insights can be potentially translated into practice, for example, with minor code modifications, we improve the generalization of the analyzed model. Our work represents a first systematic attempt to interpret black-box NCO models, showcasing probing as a promising tool for analyzing their internal mechanisms and revealing insights for the NCO community.

In particular, knowing what type of scene one is looking at generates expectations about which objects will occur, and what their spatial configuration should be. Do Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn to rely on scene contexts in a similar way, when generating references to objects? To address this question, we introduce the Common Objects Out-of-Context (COOCO) dataset and test to what extent VLMs rely on scene context to refer to objects under different degrees of scene-object congruency, and different perturbations. Our findings show that models leverage scene context adaptively, depending on both the semantic relatedness between object and scene and the level of noise. In particular, models rely more on context under high target-scene congruence or when objects are degraded. Attention analysis reveals that successful object categorisation involves increased focus on the target in mid-level layers, especially under moderate noise, suggesting that VLMs dynamically balance local and contextual information for reference generation.

Existing community search approaches fall into two categories: algorithm-based models and Machine Learning-based (ML) models. Despite the long-standing focus on this topic within the database domain, current solutions face two major limitations: 1) Both approaches fail to address personalized user requirements in OCS, consistently returning the same set of nodes for a given query regardless of user differences. 2) Existing ML-based CS models suffer from severe training efficiency issues. In this paper, we formally redefine the problem of OCS. By analyzing the gaps in both types of approaches, we then propose a general solution for OCS named Sparse Subspace Filter (SSF), which can extend any ML-based CS model to enable personalized search in overlapping structures. To overcome the efficiency issue in the current models, we introduce Simplified Multi-hop Attention Networks (SMN), a lightweight yet effective community search model with larger receptive fields. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ML-based study of overlapping community search. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of SMN within the SSF pipeline, achieving a 13.73% improvement in F1-Score and up to 3 orders of magnitude acceleration in model efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches."

    "summary": "Group sparse representation (GSR) based method has led to great successes in various image recovery tasks, which can be converted into a low-rank matrix minimization problem. As a widely used surrogate function of low-rank, the nuclear norm based convex surrogate usually leads to over-shrinking problem, since the standard soft-thresholding operator shrinks all singular values equally. To improve traditional sparse representation based image compressive sensing (CS) performance, we propose a generalized CS framework based on GSR model, which leads to a nonconvex nonsmooth low-rank minimization problem. The popular L_2-norm and M-estimator are employed for standard image CS and robust CS problem to fit the data respectively. For the better approximation of the rank of group-matrix, a family of nuclear norms are employed to address the over-shrinking problem. Moreover, we also propose a flexible and effective iteratively-weighting strategy to control the weighting and contribution of each singular value. Then we develop an iteratively reweighted nuclear norm algorithm for our generalized framework via an alternating direction method of multipliers framework, namely, GSR-AIR. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed CS framework can achieve favorable reconstruction performance compared with current state-of-the-art methods and the robust CS framework can suppress the outliers effectively."

These LIS operate as per the companys business rules that are formally specified in Calculation Specification (CS) sheets. To meet ever-changing business demands, insurance companies are increasingly transforming their outdated LIS to modern Policy Administration Systems (PAS). Quality Assurance (QA) of such PAS involves manual validation of calculations implementation against the corresponding CS sheets from the LIS. This manual QA approach is effort-intensive and error-prone, which may fail to detect inconsistencies in PAS implementations and ultimately result in monetary loss. To address this challenge, we propose a novel low-code no-code technique to automatically validate PAS implementation against CS sheets. Our technique has been evaluated on a digital transformation project of a large insurance company on 12 real-world calculations through 254 policies. The evaluation resulted in effort savings of approximately 92 percent against the conventional manual validation approach."

Over the past few years, researchers have investigated ways to harness the power of GenAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence) to improve teaching. In CS, much of the research has focused on introductory computing. A recent study evaluating the performance of an LLM (Large Language Model), GPT-4 (text-only), on CG questions, indicated poor performance and reliance on detailed descriptions of image content, which often required considerable insight from the user to return reasonable results. So far, no studies have investigated the abilities of LMMs (Large Multimodal Models), or multimodal LLMs, to solve CG questions and how these abilities can be used to improve teaching. In this study, we construct two datasets of CG questions requiring varying degrees of visual perception skills and geometric reasoning skills, and evaluate the current state-of-the-art LMM, GPT-4o, on the two datasets. We find that although GPT-4o exhibits great potential in solving questions with visual information independently, major limitations still exist to the accuracy and quality of the generated results. We propose several novel approaches for CG educators to incorporate GenAI into CG teaching despite these limitations. We hope that our guidelines further encourage learning and engagement in CG classrooms."

To mitigate the issue, we propose a new regularization method that penalizes the predictive distribution between similar samples. In particular, we distill the predictive distribution between different samples of the same label during training. This results in regularizing the dark knowledge (i.e., the knowledge on wrong predictions) of a single network (i.e., a self-knowledge distillation) by forcing it to produce more meaningful and consistent predictions in a class-wise manner. Consequently, it mitigates overconfident predictions and reduces intra-class variations. Our experimental results on various image classification tasks demonstrate that the simple yet powerful method can significantly improve not only the generalization ability but also the calibration performance of modern convolutional neural networks."

At the same time, autonomous robotic platforms such as drones and rovers have become increasingly popular tools for remote sensing and environmental monitoring tasks, including measurements of temperature, humidity, and air quality. Within this context, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first investigation into how the structure of CS measurement matrices can be exploited to design optimized sampling trajectories for robotic environmental data collection. We propose a novel Monte Carlo optimization framework that generates measurement matrices designed to minimize both the robot's traversal path length and the signal reconstruction error within the CS framework. Central to our approach is the application of Dictionary Learning (DL) to obtain a data-driven sparsifying transform, which enhances reconstruction accuracy while further reducing the number of samples that the robot needs to collect. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments reconstructing pollution maps over the Gulf region. The results indicate that our approach can reduce robot travel distance to less than of a full-coverage path, while improving reconstruction accuracy by over a factor of five compared to traditional CS methods based on DCT and polynomial dictionaries, as well as by a factor of two compared to previously-proposed Informative Path Planning (IPP) methods."

The BSs, assumed to be oblivious of the applied codebooks, forward compressed versions of their observations to a central station (CS) via capacity limited backhaul links. The CS jointly decodes the messages from all UTs. Since the BSs and the CS are assumed to have no prior channel state information (CSI), the channel needs to be estimated during its coherence time. Based on a lower bound of the ergodic mutual information, we determine the optimal fraction of the coherence time used for channel training, taking different path losses between the UTs and the BSs into account. We then study how the optimal training length is impacted by the backhaul capacity. Although our analytical results are based on a large system limit, we show by simulations that they provide very accurate approximations for even small system dimensions."

Covariance steering (CS) is an emerging methodology in stochastic optimal control that poses constraints on the first two moments of the state distribution -- thereby being more tractable than full distributional control. Nevertheless, a significant limitation of current approaches for solving nonlinear CS problems, such as sequential convex programming (SCP), is that they often generate infeasible or poor results due to the large number of constraints. In this paper, we address these challenges, by proposing an operator splitting CS approach that temporarily decouples the full problem into subproblems that can be solved in parallel. This relaxation does not require intermediate iterates to satisfy all constraints simultaneously prior to convergence, which enhances exploration and improves feasibility in such non-convex settings. Simulation results across a variety of robotics applications verify the ability of the proposed method to find better solutions even under stricter safety constraints than standard SCP. Finally, the applicability of our framework on real systems is also confirmed through hardware demonstrations"

While often motivated as an alternative to Nyquist-rate sampling, there remains a gap between the discrete, finite-dimensional CS framework and the problem of acquiring a continuous-time signal. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by exploiting the Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences (DPSS's), a collection of functions that trace back to the seminal work by Slepian, Landau, and Pollack on the effects of time-limiting and bandlimiting operations. DPSS's form a highly efficient basis for sampled bandlimited functions; by modulating and merging DPSS bases, we obtain a dictionary that offers high-quality sparse approximations for most sampled multiband signals. This multiband modulated DPSS dictionary can be readily incorporated into the CS framework. We provide theoretical guarantees and practical insight into the use of this dictionary for recovery of sampled multiband signals from compressive measurements."

The resulting (multi-echo) images are usually used for quantitative MR imaging. Acquiring MR images is a slow process and acquiring multi scans of the same cross section for multi-echo imaging is even slower. In order to accelerate the scan, compressed sensing (CS) based techniques have been advocating partial K-space (Fourier domain) scans; the resulting images are reconstructed via structured CS algorithms. In recent times, it has been shown that instead of using off-the-shelf CS, better results can be obtained by adaptive reconstruction algorithms based on structured dictionary learning. In this work, we show that the reconstruction results can be further improved by using structured deep dictionaries. Experimental results on real datasets show that by using our proposed technique the scan-time can be cut by half compared to the state-of-the-art."

However, despite their underpinning role for practical applications, existing uniqueness relations are either computationally prohibitive to implement (Restricted Isometry Property), or involve mathematical tools that are beyond the standard background of engineering graduates (Coherence Index). This can introduce conceptual and computational obstacles in the development of engineering intuition, the design of suboptimal practical solutions, or understanding of limitations. To this end, we introduce a simple but rigorous derivation of the coherence index condition, based on standard linear algebra, with the aim to empower signal processing practitioners with intuition in the design and ease in implementation of CS systems. Given that the coherence index is one of very few CS metrics that admits mathematically tractable and computationally feasible calculation, it is our hope that this work will help bridge the gap between the theory and applications of compressive sensing."

    "summary": "A universal 1-bit compressive sensing (CS) scheme consists of a measurement matrix such that all signals belonging to a particular class can be approximately recovered from . 1-bit CS models extreme quantization effects where only one bit of information is revealed per measurement. We focus on universal support recovery for 1-bit CS in the case of sparse signals with bounded dynamic range . Specifically, a vector is said to have sparsity if it has at most nonzero entries, and dynamic range if the ratio between its largest and smallest nonzero entries is at most in magnitude. Our main result shows that if the entries of the measurement matrix are i.i.d.~Gaussians, then under mild assumptions on the scaling of and , the number of measurements needs to be to recover the support of -sparse signals with dynamic range using -bit CS. In addition, we show that a near-matching upper bound follows as a simple corollary of known results. The scaling contrasts with the known lower bound of for the number of measurements to recover the support of arbitrary -sparse signals."

    "title": "Cued-Agent: A Collaborative Multi-Agent System for Automatic Cued Speech Recognition",
    "summary": "Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system that combines lip-reading with hand coding to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing impairments. Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures and lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal asynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex modules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by limited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity for adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal performance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in handling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose the first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It integrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based Hand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt strategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip Recognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand Prompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip features during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction Phoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from phoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through semantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS dataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a mixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Cued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is available at https://github.com/DennisHgj/Cued-Agent."

    "title": "EntityCS: Improving Zero-Shot Cross-lingual Transfer with Entity-Centric Code Switching",
    "summary": "Accurate alignment between languages is fundamental for improving cross-lingual pre-trained language models (XLMs). Motivated by the natural phenomenon of code-switching (CS) in multilingual speakers, CS has been used as an effective data augmentation method that offers language alignment at the word- or phrase-level, in contrast to sentence-level via parallel instances. Existing approaches either use dictionaries or parallel sentences with word alignment to generate CS data by randomly switching words in a sentence. However, such methods can be suboptimal as dictionaries disregard semantics, and syntax might become invalid after random word switching. In this work, we propose EntityCS, a method that focuses on Entity-level Code-Switching to capture fine-grained cross-lingual semantics without corrupting syntax. We use Wikidata and English Wikipedia to construct an entity-centric CS corpus by switching entities to their counterparts in other languages. We further propose entity-oriented masking strategies during intermediate model training on the EntityCS corpus for improving entity prediction. Evaluation of the trained models on four entity-centric downstream tasks shows consistent improvements over the baseline with a notable increase of 10% in Fact Retrieval. We release the corpus and models to assist research on code-switching and enriching XLMs with external knowledge."

However, when the signal is corrupted by Cauchy or Cubic Gaussian noise, these norms fail to provide accurate reconstruction. Therefore, in order to achieve accurate reconstruction, the application of l3 minimization norm is analyzed. The efficiency of algorithm will be demonstrated on examples."

    "title": "Sampling and Recovery of Pulse Streams",
    "summary": "Compressive Sensing (CS) is a new technique for the efficient acquisition of signals, images, and other data that have a sparse representation in some basis, frame, or dictionary. By sparse we mean that the N-dimensional basis representation has just K<<N significant coefficients; in this case, the CS theory maintains that just M = K log N random linear signal measurements will both preserve all of the signal information and enable robust signal reconstruction in polynomial time. In this paper, we extend the CS theory to pulse stream data, which correspond to S-sparse signals/images that are convolved with an unknown F-sparse pulse shape. Ignoring their convolutional structure, a pulse stream signal is K=SF sparse. Such signals figure prominently in a number of applications, from neuroscience to astronomy. Our specific contributions are threefold. First, we propose a pulse stream signal model and show that it is equivalent to an infinite union of subspaces. Second, we derive a lower bound on the number of measurements M required to preserve the essential information present in pulse streams. The bound is linear in the total number of degrees of freedom S + F, which is significantly smaller than the naive bound based on the total signal sparsity K=SF. Third, we develop an efficient signal recovery algorithm that infers both the shape of the impulse response as well as the locations and amplitudes of the pulses. The algorithm alternatively estimates the pulse locations and the pulse shape in a manner reminiscent of classical deconvolution algorithms. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the advantages of our approach over standard CS."

    "summary": "Reliable and energy-efficient wireless data transmission remains a major challenge in resource-constrained wireless neural recording tasks, where data compression is generally adopted to relax the burdens on the wireless data link. Recently, Compressed Sensing (CS) theory has successfully demonstrated its potential in neural recording application. The main limitation of CS, however, is that the neural signals have no good sparse representation with commonly used dictionaries and learning a reliable dictionary is often data dependent and computationally demanding. In this paper, a novel CS approach for implantable neural recording is proposed. The main contributions are: 1) The co-sparse analysis model is adopted to enforce co-sparsity of the neural signals, therefore overcoming the drawbacks of conventional synthesis model and enhancing the reconstruction performance. 2) A multi-fractional-order difference matrix is constructed as the analysis dictionary, thus avoiding the dictionary learning procedure and reducing the need for previously acquired data and computational resources. 3) By exploiting the statistical priors of the analysis coefficients, a weighted analysis -minimization (WALM) algorithm is proposed to reconstruct the neural signals. Experimental results on Leicester neural signal database reveal that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art CS-based methods. On the challenging high compression ratio task, the proposed approach still achieves high reconstruction performance and spike classification accuracy."

Despite its importance, opportunities for structured practice remain limited. Conversational AI offers potential assistance, but limited research explores user perceptions of its role in think-aloud practice. To address this gap, we conducted a study with 17 participants using an LLM-based technical interview practice tool. Participants valued AI's role in simulation, feedback, and learning from generated examples. Key design recommendations include promoting social presence in conversational AI for technical interview simulation, providing feedback beyond verbal content analysis, and enabling crowdsourced think-aloud examples through human-AI collaboration. Beyond feature design, we examined broader considerations, including intersectional challenges and potential strategies to address them, how AI-driven interview preparation could promote equitable learning in computing careers, and the need to rethink AI's role in interview practice by suggesting a research direction that integrates human-AI collaboration."

    "title": "ReProCS: A Missing Link between Recursive Robust PCA and Recursive Sparse Recovery in Large but Correlated Noise",
    "summary": "This work studies the recursive robust principal components' analysis (PCA) problem. Here, \"robust\" refers to robustness to both independent and correlated sparse outliers, although we focus on the latter. A key application where this problem occurs is in video surveillance where the goal is to separate a slowly changing background from moving foreground objects on-the-fly. The background sequence is well modeled as lying in a low dimensional subspace, that can gradually change over time, while the moving foreground objects constitute the correlated sparse outliers. In this and many other applications, the foreground is an outlier for PCA but is actually the \"signal of interest\" for the application; where as the background is the corruption or noise. Thus our problem can also be interpreted as one of recursively recovering a time sequence of sparse signals in the presence of large but spatially correlated noise. This work has two key contributions. First, we provide a new way of looking at this problem and show how a key part of our solution strategy involves solving a noisy compressive sensing (CS) problem. Second, we show how we can utilize the correlation of the outliers to our advantage in order to even deal with very large support sized outliers. The main idea is as follows. The correlation model applied to the previous support estimate helps predict the current support. This prediction serves as \"partial support knowledge\" for solving the modified-CS problem instead of CS. The support estimate of the modified-CS reconstruction is, in turn, used to update the correlation model parameters using a Kalman filter (or any adaptive filter). We call the resulting approach \"support-predicted modified-CS\"."

    "summary": "This paper proposes a joint framework wherein lifting-based, separable, image-matched wavelets are estimated from compressively sensed (CS) images and used for the reconstruction of the same. Matched wavelet can be easily designed if full image is available. Also matched wavelet may provide better reconstruction results in CS application compared to standard wavelet sparsifying basis. Since in CS application, we have compressively sensed image instead of full image, existing methods of designing matched wavelet cannot be used. Thus, we propose a joint framework that estimates matched wavelet from the compressively sensed images and also reconstructs full images. This paper has three significant contributions. First, lifting-based, image-matched separable wavelet is designed from compressively sensed images and is also used to reconstruct the same. Second, a simple sensing matrix is employed to sample data at sub-Nyquist rate such that sensing and reconstruction time is reduced considerably without any noticeable degradation in the reconstruction performance. Third, a new multi-level L-Pyramid wavelet decomposition strategy is provided for separable wavelet implementation on images that leads to improved reconstruction performance. Compared to CS-based reconstruction using standard wavelets with Gaussian sensing matrix and with existing wavelet decomposition strategy, the proposed methodology provides faster and better image reconstruction in compressive sensing application."

    "title": "IVAC-P2L: Leveraging Irregular Repetition Priors for Improving Video Action Counting",
    "summary": "Video Action Counting (VAC) is crucial in analyzing sports, fitness, and everyday activities by quantifying repetitive actions in videos. However, traditional VAC methods have overlooked the complexity of action repetitions, such as interruptions and the variability in cycle duration. Our research addresses the shortfall by introducing a novel approach to VAC, called Irregular Video Action Counting (IVAC). IVAC prioritizes modeling irregular repetition patterns in videos, which we define through two primary aspects: Inter-cycle Consistency and Cycle-interval Inconsistency. Inter-cycle Consistency ensures homogeneity in the spatial-temporal representations of cycle segments, signifying action uniformity within cycles. Cycle-interval inconsistency highlights the importance of distinguishing between cycle segments and intervals based on their inherent content differences. To encapsulate these principles, we propose a new methodology that includes consistency and inconsistency modules, supported by a unique pull-push loss (P2L) mechanism. The IVAC-P2L model applies a pull loss to promote coherence among cycle segment features and a push loss to clearly distinguish features of cycle segments from interval segments. Empirical evaluations conducted on the RepCount dataset demonstrate that the IVAC-P2L model sets a new benchmark in VAC task performance. Furthermore, the model demonstrates exceptional adaptability and generalization across various video contents, outperforming existing models on two additional datasets, UCFRep and Countix, without the need for dataset-specific optimization. These results confirm the efficacy of our approach in addressing irregular repetitions in videos and pave the way for further advancements in video analysis and understanding."

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) of CS speech has to deal with two or more languages at the same time. In this study, we propose a Transformer-based architecture with two symmetric language-specific encoders to capture the individual language attributes, that improve the acoustic representation of each language. These representations are combined using a language-specific multi-head attention mechanism in the decoder module. Each encoder and its corresponding attention module in the decoder are pre-trained using a large monolingual corpus aiming to alleviate the impact of limited CS training data. We call such a network a multi-encoder-decoder (MED) architecture. Experiments on the SEAME corpus show that the proposed MED architecture achieves 10.2% and 10.8% relative error rate reduction on the CS evaluation sets with Mandarin and English as the matrix language respectively."

We argue that, the condition is likely to hold in a dense deployment of Access Points (APs) where, for every client or station (STA), there is an AP very close to the STA such that the STA can associate with the AP at a high physical rate. We develop a scalable cell level model for such WLANs with saturated AP and STA queues as well as for TCP-controlled long file downloads. The accuracy of our model is demonstrated by comparison with ns-2 simulations. We also demonstrate how our analytical model could be applied in conjunction with a Learning Automata (LA) algorithm for optimal channel assignment. Based on the insights provided by our analytical model, we propose a simple decentralized algorithm which provides static channel assignments that are Nash equilibria in pure strategies for the objective of maximizing normalized network throughput. Our channel assignment algorithm requires neither any explicit knowledge of the topology nor any message passing, and provides assignments in only as many steps as there are channels. In contrast to prior work, our approach to channel assignment is based on the throughput metric."

In this experience report, we present a case study describing our process of designing an ethics-based assignment and proposing the assignment to students for feedback. Participants in our focus groups not only shared feedback on the assignment, but also on the integration of ethics into coding assignments in general, revealing the benefits and challenges of this work from a student perspective.

Similar to the ZC case, we propose a system of simultaneously constrained signed-CS problems to reconstruct a sparse signal from its Level Crossings (LC)s and modify both the Binary Iterative Hard Thresholding (BIHT) and BSL0 algorithms to solve this problem. Simulation results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed LC reconstruction techniques in comparison with the literature."

To arrive at the results, we employ a duality between noiseless CS and analog coding across sparse additive noisy channel (SANC). Extending Renyi Information Dimension to Mutual Information Dimension (MID), we show the operational meaning of MID to be the fundamental limit of asymptotically error-free analog transmission across SANC under linear analog encoding constraint. We prove that MID polarizes after analog polar transformation and obeys the same recursive relationship as BEC. We further prove that analog polar encoding can achieve the fundamental limit of achievable dimension rate with vanishing Pe across SANC. From the duality, a structured construction scheme is proposed for the linear measurement matrix which achieves the minimum measurement requirement for noiseless CS."

    "title": "Real-time FPGA Design for OMP Targeting 8K Image Reconstruction",
    "summary": "During the past decade, implementing reconstruction algorithms on hardware has been at the center of much attention in the field of real-time reconstruction in Compressed Sensing (CS). Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) is the most widely used reconstruction algorithm on hardware implementation because OMP obtains good quality reconstruction results under a proper time cost. OMP includes Dot Product (DP) and Least Square Problem (LSP). These two parts have numerous division calculations and considerable vector-based multiplications, which limit the implementation of real-time reconstruction on hardware. In the theory of CS, besides the reconstruction algorithm, the choice of sensing matrix affects the quality of reconstruction. It also influences the reconstruction efficiency by affecting the hardware architecture. Thus, designing a real-time hardware architecture of OMP needs to take three factors into consideration. The choice of sensing matrix, the implementation of DP and LSP. In this paper, a sensing matrix, which is sparsity and contains zero vectors mainly, is adopted to optimize the OMP reconstruction to break the bottleneck of reconstruction efficiency. Based on the features of the chosen matrix, the DP and LSP are implemented by simple shift, add and comparing procedures. This work is implemented on the Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ FPGA device. To reconstruct a digital signal with 1024 length under 0.25 sampling rate, the proposal method costs 0.818us while the state-of-the-art costs 238$us. Thus, this work speedups the state-of-the-art method 290 times. This work costs 0.026s to reconstruct an 8K gray image, which achieves 30FPS real-time reconstruction."

    "title": "Uncertainty-Aware Testing-Time Optimization for 3D Human Pose Estimation",
    "summary": "Although data-driven methods have achieved success in 3D human pose estimation, they often suffer from domain gaps and exhibit limited generalization. In contrast, optimization-based methods excel in fine-tuning for specific cases but are generally inferior to data-driven methods in overall performance. We observe that previous optimization-based methods commonly rely on a projection constraint, which only ensures alignment in 2D space, potentially leading to the overfitting problem. To address this, we propose an Uncertainty-Aware testing-time Optimization (UAO) framework, which keeps the prior information of the pre-trained model and alleviates the overfitting problem using the uncertainty of joints. Specifically, during the training phase, we design an effective 2D-to-3D network for estimating the corresponding 3D pose while quantifying the uncertainty of each 3D joint. For optimization during testing, the proposed optimization framework freezes the pre-trained model and optimizes only a latent state. Projection loss is then employed to ensure the generated poses are well aligned in 2D space for high-quality optimization. Furthermore, we utilize the uncertainty of each joint to determine how much each joint is allowed for optimization. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework are validated through extensive experiments on challenging datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. Notably, our approach outperforms the previous best result by a large margin of 5.5\\% on Human3.6M. Code is available at https://github.com/xiu-cs/UAO-Pose3D https://github.com/xiu-cs/UAO-Pose3D ."

The approach effectively dampens structured CS artefacts, which can be difficult to remove assuming sparse reconstruction, or relying solely on the inductive biases of CNN to produce noise-free images.

The system integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ANU Scholarly Knowledge Graph (ASKG), a structured repository of all research-related artifacts produced at ANU in the CS field. Each artifact and its parts are represented as textual nodes stored in a Knowledge Graph (KG). To address the limitations of traditional scholarly KG construction and utilization methods, which often fail to capture fine-grained details, we propose a novel framework that integrates the Deep Document Model (DDM) for comprehensive document representation and the KG-enhanced Query Processing (KGQP) for optimized complex query handling. DDM enables a fine-grained representation of the hierarchical structure and semantic relationships within academic papers, while KGQP leverages the KG structure to improve query accuracy and efficiency with LLMs. By combining the ASKG with LLMs, our approach enhances knowledge utilization and natural language understanding capabilities. The proposed system employs an automatic LLM-SPARQL fusion to retrieve relevant facts and textual nodes from the ASKG. Initial experiments demonstrate that our framework is superior to baseline methods in terms of accuracy retrieval and query efficiency. We showcase the practical application of our framework in academic research scenarios, highlighting its potential to revolutionize scholarly knowledge management and discovery.

Based on a typical signal sensing application, we illustrate and evaluate the performance of two of our algorithms, Individual Chasing and Centroid Chasing, for signals of different distribution features. Our proposed learning-based adaptive sampling schemes complement existing efforts in CS fields and do not depend on any specific signal reconstruction technique.

    "summary": "Safety-aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) still show two dominant failure modes: they are easily jailbroken, or they over-refuse harmless inputs that contain sensitive surface signals. We trace both to a common cause: current models reason weakly about links between actions and outcomes and over-rely on surface-form signals, lexical or stylistic cues that do not encode consequences. We define this failure mode as Consequence-blindness. To study consequence-blindness, we build a benchmark named CB-Bench covering four risk scenarios that vary whether semantic risk aligns with outcome risk, enabling evaluation under both matched and mismatched conditions which are often ignored by existing safety benchmarks. Mainstream models consistently fail to separate these risks and exhibit consequence-blindness, indicating that consequence-blindness is widespread and systematic. To mitigate consequence-blindness, we introduce CS-Chain-4k, a consequence-reasoning dataset for safety alignment. Models fine-tuned on CS-Chain-4k show clear gains against semantic-camouflage jailbreaks and reduce over-refusal on harmless inputs, while maintaining utility and generalization on other benchmarks. These results clarify the limits of current alignment, establish consequence-aware reasoning as a core alignment goal and provide a more practical and reproducible evaluation path."

We propose a novel data structure, called Influence Dispersion Tree (IDT) to model the organization of follow-up papers and their dependencies through citations. We also propose the notion of an ideal IDT for every paper and show that an ideal (highly influential) paper should increase the knowledge of a field vertically and horizontally. Upon suitably exploring the structural properties of IDT, we derive a suite of metrics, namely Influence Dispersion Index (IDI), Normalized Influence Divergence (NID) to quantify the influence of a paper. Our theoretical analysis shows that an ideal IDT configuration should have equal depth and breadth (and thus minimize the NID value). We establish the superiority of NID as a better influence measure in two experimental settings. First, on a large real-world bibliographic dataset, we show that NID outperforms raw citation count as an early predictor of the number of new citations a paper will receive within a certain period after publication. Second, we show that NID is superior to the raw citation count at identifying the papers recognized as highly influential through Test of Time Award among all their contemporary papers (published in the same venue). We conclude that in order to quantify the influence of a paper, along with the total citation count, one should also consider how the citing papers are organized among themselves to better understand the influence of a paper on the research field.

Measuring and eliminating gerrymandering has enormous implications to sustain the backbone of democratic principles of a society. Although there is no dearth of legal briefs involving gerrymandering over many years, it is only more recently that mathematicians and applied computational researchers have started to investigate this topic. However, it has received relatively little attention so far from the computational complexity researchers dealing with theoretical analysis of computational complexity issues, such as computational hardness, approximability issues, etc. There could be many reasons for this, such as descriptions of these problem non-CS non-math (often legal or political) journals that theoretical CS (TCS) people usually do not follow, or the lack of coverage of these topics in TCS publication venues. One of our modest goals in writing this article is to improve upon this situation by stimulating further interactions between the gerrymandering and TCS researchers. To this effect, our main contributions are twofold: (1) we provide formalization of several models, related concepts, and corresponding problem statements using TCS frameworks from the descriptions of these problems as available in existing non-TCS (perhaps legal) venues, and (2) we also provide computational complexity analysis of some versions of these problems, leaving other versions for future research. The goal of writing this article is not to have the final word on gerrymandering, but to introduce a series of concepts, models and problems to the TCS community and to show that science of gerrymandering involves an intriguing set of partitioning problems involving geometric and combinatorial optimization."

    "summary": "In the School of Computing at the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT), Ireland, we undertook our Computer Science for All (CS4All) initiative, a five year strategy to implement structural reforms at Faculty level, to address recruitment and retention issues of female undergraduate computer science (CS) students. Since 2012, under CS4All we implemented a variety of reforms to improve student retention, set up a new CS program to attract more female students, and delivered changes to promote a sense of community amongst our female students. We have made significant improvements. For example, we have achieved a dramatic improvement in retention rising from 45% to 89% in first year progression rates. Our new hybrid CS International program has more than double the percentage of females first year enrolments in comparison to our other undergraduate programs. As at 2018, we continue to roll out the remaining parts of CS4All within our School."

    "title": "Cyclic Shift Code for SAC-OCDMA Using Fiber Bragg-Grating",
    "summary": "We proposed a novel code called cyclic shift (CS) code to overcome the drawbacks exists in traditional Spectral Amplitude Coding- Optical Code Division Multiple Access (SAC-OCDMA) codes that have been presented in the past few years. The proposed cyclic shift code has simple construction and large cardinality in selecting the code weight and the number of users. It also has zero cross correlation which allows it to suppress both Multiple Access Interference (MAI) and Phase Induced Intensity Noise (PIIN). Moreover, the frequency bins of the proposed code exist beside each other which reduce the number of filters needed to encode and decode the data. Therefore, the receiver design becomes simple and cost efficient. We compared the performance of our proposed code to the traditional codes and show that our proposed code gives better performance than the traditional SAC-OCDMA codes. A mathematical analysis of CS code has been derived. Simulation analysis for CS code has been carried out using optisystem ver.13."

    "title": "Performance Limits of Compressive Sensing Channel Estimation in Dense Cloud RAN",
    "summary": "Towards reducing the training signaling overhead in large scale and dense cloud radio access networks (CRAN), various approaches have been proposed based on the channel sparsification assumption, namely, only a small subset of the deployed remote radio heads (RRHs) are of significance to any user in the system. Motivated by the potential of compressive sensing (CS) techniques in this setting, this paper provides a rigorous description of the performance limits of many practical CS algorithms by considering the performance of the, so called, oracle estimator, which knows a priori which RRHs are of significance but not their corresponding channel values. By using tools from stochastic geometry, a closed form analytical expression of the oracle estimator performance is obtained, averaged over distribution of RRH positions and channel statistics. Apart from a bound on practical CS algorithms, the analysis provides important design insights, e.g., on how the training sequence length affects performance, and identifies the operational conditions where the channel sparsification assumption is valid. It is shown that the latter is true only in operational conditions with sufficiently large path loss exponents."

    "summary": "We propose an original concept of compressive sensing (CS) polarimetric imaging based on a digital micro-mirror (DMD) array and two single-pixel detectors. The polarimetric sensitivity of the proposed setup is due to an experimental imperfection of reflecting mirrors which is exploited here to form an original reconstruction problem, including a CS problem and a source separation task. We show that a two-step approach tackling each problem successively is outperformed by a dedicated combined reconstruction method, which is explicited in this article and preferably implemented through a reweighted FISTA algorithm. The combined reconstruction approach is then further improved by including physical constraints specific to the polarimetric imaging context considered, which are implemented in an original constrained GFB algorithm. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the 2-pixel CS polarimetric imaging setup to retrieve polarimetric contrast data with significant compression rate and good reconstruction quality. The influence of experimental imperfections of the DMD are also analyzed through numerical simulations, and 2D polarimetric imaging reconstruction results are finally presented."

    "title": "$α$-Flow: A Unified Framework for Continuous-State Discrete Flow Matching Models",
    "summary": "Recent efforts have extended the flow-matching framework to discrete generative modeling. One strand of models directly works with the continuous probabilities instead of discrete tokens, which we colloquially refer to as Continuous-State Discrete Flow Matching (CS-DFM). Existing CS-DFM models differ significantly in their representations and geometric assumptions. This work presents a unified framework for CS-DFM models, under which the existing variants can be understood as operating on different -representations of probabilities. Building upon the theory of information geometry, we introduce -Flow, a family of CS-DFM models that adheres to the canonical -geometry of the statistical manifold, and demonstrate its optimality in minimizing the generalized kinetic energy. Theoretically, we show that the flow matching loss for -flow establishes a unified variational bound for the discrete negative log-likelihood. We comprehensively evaluate different instantiations of -flow on various discrete generation domains to demonstrate their effectiveness in discrete generative modeling, including intermediate values whose geometries have never been explored before. -flow significantly outperforms its discrete-state counterpart in image and protein sequence generation and better captures the entropy in language modeling."

    "summary": "The celebrated FedAvg algorithm of McMahan et al. (2017) is based on three components: client sampling (CS), data sampling (DS) and local training (LT). While the first two are reasonably well understood, the third component, whose role is to reduce the number of communication rounds needed to train the model, resisted all attempts at a satisfactory theoretical explanation. Malinovsky et al. (2022) identified four distinct generations of LT methods based on the quality of the provided theoretical communication complexity guarantees. Despite a lot of progress in this area, none of the existing works were able to show that it is theoretically better to employ multiple local gradient-type steps (i.e., to engage in LT) than to rely on a single local gradient-type step only in the important heterogeneous data regime. In a recent breakthrough embodied in their ProxSkip method and its theoretical analysis, Mishchenko et al. (2022) showed that LT indeed leads to provable communication acceleration for arbitrarily heterogeneous data, thus jump-starting the generation of LT methods. However, while these latest generation LT methods are compatible with DS, none of them support CS. We resolve this open problem in the affirmative. In order to do so, we had to base our algorithmic development on new algorithmic and theoretical foundations."

    "title": "Hierarchical Characteristic Set Merging for Optimizing SPARQL Queries in Heterogeneous RDF",
    "summary": "Characteristic sets (CS) organize RDF triples based on the set of properties characterizing their subject nodes. This concept is recently used in indexing techniques, as it can capture the implicit schema of RDF data. While most CS-based approaches yield significant improvements in space and query performance, they fail to perform well in the presence of schema heterogeneity, i.e., when the number of CSs becomes very large, resulting in a highly partitioned data organization. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing a novel technique, for merging CSs based on their hierarchical structure. Our technique employs a lattice to capture the hierarchical relationships between CSs, identifies dense CSs and merges dense CSs with their ancestors, thus reducing the size of the CSs as well as the links between them. We implemented our algorithm on top of a relational backbone, where each merged CS is stored in a relational table, and we performed an extensive experimental study to evaluate the performance and impact of merging to the storage and querying of RDF datasets, indicating significant improvements."

    "summary": "Given a graph , a query node , and an integer , community search (CS) seeks a cohesive subgraph (measured by community models such as -core or -truss) from that contains . It is difficult for ordinary users with less knowledge of graphs' complexity to set an appropriate . Even if we define quite a large , the community size returned by CS is often too large for users to gain much insight about it. Compared against the entire community, key-members in the community appear more valuable than others. To contend with this, we focus on Community Key-members Search problem (CKS). We turn our perspective to the key-members in the community containing instead of the entire community. To solve CKS problem, we first propose an exact algorithm based on truss decomposition as a baseline. Then, we present four random walk-based optimized algorithms to achieve a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency, by carefully considering three important cohesiveness features in the design of transition matrix. As a result, we return key-members according to the stationary distribution when random walk converges. We theoretically analyze the rationality of designing the cohesiveness-aware transition matrix for random walk, through Bayesian theory based on Gaussian Mixture Model with Box-Cox Transformation and Copula Function Fitting. Moreover, we propose a lightweight refinement method following an ``expand-replace\" manner to further optimize the result with little overhead, and we extend our method for CKS with multiple query nodes. Comprehensive experimental studies on various real-world datasets demonstrate our method's superiority."

    "title": "Cost-Sensitive Support Vector Machines",
    "summary": "A new procedure for learning cost-sensitive SVM(CS-SVM) classifiers is proposed. The SVM hinge loss is extended to the cost sensitive setting, and the CS-SVM is derived as the minimizer of the associated risk. The extension of the hinge loss draws on recent connections between risk minimization and probability elicitation. These connections are generalized to cost-sensitive classification, in a manner that guarantees consistency with the cost-sensitive Bayes risk, and associated Bayes decision rule. This ensures that optimal decision rules, under the new hinge loss, implement the Bayes-optimal cost-sensitive classification boundary. Minimization of the new hinge loss is shown to be a generalization of the classic SVM optimization problem, and can be solved by identical procedures. The dual problem of CS-SVM is carefully scrutinized by means of regularization theory and sensitivity analysis and the CS-SVM algorithm is substantiated. The proposed algorithm is also extended to cost-sensitive learning with example dependent costs. The minimum cost sensitive risk is proposed as the performance measure and is connected to ROC analysis through vector optimization. The resulting algorithm avoids the shortcomings of previous approaches to cost-sensitive SVM design, and is shown to have superior experimental performance on a large number of cost sensitive and imbalanced datasets."

Recently, compressed sensing (CS) approaches have been extensively investigated as a new tool for this problem using partial support information obtained by exploiting temporal redundancy. However, most of these approaches are formulated under single measurement vector compressed sensing (SMV-CS) framework, where the performance guarantees are only in a probabilistic manner. The main contribution of this paper is to allow deterministic tracking of time varying supports with multiple measurement vectors (MMV) by exploiting multi-sensor diversity. In particular, we show that a novel compressive MUSIC (CS-MUSIC) algorithm with optimized partial support selection not only allows removal of inaccurate portion of previous support estimation but also enables addition of newly emerged part of unknown support. Numerical results confirm the theory."

    "summary": "Transformer architectures have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI) through their attention mechanisms, yet the computational principles underlying their success remain opaque. We present a novel theoretical framework that reinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our model finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which simplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate that attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements of classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional stimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that contain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention operation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where CS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our framework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized model: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store O( ) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an error propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of balancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and (3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance transformer architectures. By establishing this deep connection, we suggest that the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone, but from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over millions of years of evolution."

    "title": "Improved Total Variation based Image Compressive Sensing Recovery by Nonlocal Regularization",
    "summary": "Recently, total variation (TV) based minimization algorithms have achieved great success in compressive sensing (CS) recovery for natural images due to its virtue of preserving edges. However, the use of TV is not able to recover the fine details and textures, and often suffers from undesirable staircase artifact. To reduce these effects, this letter presents an improved TV based image CS recovery algorithm by introducing a new nonlocal regularization constraint into CS optimization problem. The nonlocal regularization is built on the well known nonlocal means (NLM) filtering and takes advantage of self-similarity in images, which helps to suppress the staircase effect and restore the fine details. Furthermore, an efficient augmented Lagrangian based algorithm is developed to solve the above combined TV and nonlocal regularization constrained problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art TV based algorithm in both PSNR and visual perception."

    "summary": "A confidence sequence (CS) is an anytime-valid sequential inference primitive which produces an adapted sequence of sets for a predictable parameter sequence with a time-uniform coverage guarantee. This work constructs a non-parametric non-asymptotic lower CS for the running average conditional expectation whose slack converges to zero given non-negative right heavy-tailed observations with bounded mean. Specifically, when the variance is finite the approach dominates the empirical Bernstein supermartingale of Howard et. al.; with infinite variance, can adapt to a known or unknown -th moment bound; and can be efficiently approximated using a sublinear number of sufficient statistics. In certain cases this lower CS can be converted into a closed-interval CS whose width converges to zero, e.g., any bounded realization, or post contextual-bandit inference with bounded rewards and unbounded importance weights. A reference implementation and example simulations demonstrate the technique."

    "summary": "Compressive sensing (CS) has been studied and applied in structural health monitoring for wireless data acquisition and transmission, structural modal identification, and spare damage identification. The key issue in CS is finding the optimal solution for sparse optimization. In the past years, many algorithms have been proposed in the field of applied mathematics. In this paper, we propose a machine-learning-based approach to solve the CS data-reconstruction problem. By treating a computation process as a data flow, the process of CS-based data reconstruction is formalized into a standard supervised-learning task. The prior knowledge, i.e., the basis matrix and the CS-sampled signals, are used as the input and the target of the network; the basis coefficient matrix is embedded as the parameters of a certain layer; the objective function of conventional compressive sensing is set as the loss function of the network. Regularized by l1-norm, these basis coefficients are optimized to reduce the error between the original CS-sampled signals and the masked reconstructed signals with a common optimization algorithm. Also, the proposed network can handle complex bases, such as a Fourier basis. Benefiting from the nature of a multi-neuron layer, multiple signal channels can be reconstructed simultaneously. Meanwhile, the disassembled use of a large-scale basis makes the method memory-efficient. A numerical example of multiple sinusoidal waves and an example of field-test wireless data from a suspension bridge are carried out to illustrate the data-reconstruction ability of the proposed approach. The results show that high reconstruction accuracy can be obtained by the machine learning-based approach. Also, the parameters of the network have clear meanings; the inference of the mapping between input and output is fully transparent, making the CS data reconstruction neural network interpretable."

    "summary": "Observations of the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) in the nuclear starburst galaxy NGC 4945 with MeerKAT are presented. We find a large amount of halo gas, previously missed by HI observations, accounting for 6.8% of the total HI mass. This is most likely gas blown into the halo by star formation. Our maps go down to a column density level of . We model the HI distribution using tilted-ring fitting techniques and find a warp on the galaxy's approaching and receding sides. The HI in the northern side of the galaxy appears to be suppressed. This may be the result of ionisation by the starburst activity in the galaxy, as suggested by a previous study. The origin of the warp is unclear but could be due to past interactions or ram pressure stripping. Broad, asymmetric HI absorption lines extending beyond the HI emission velocity channels are present towards the nuclear region of NGC 4945. Such broad lines suggest the existence of a nuclear ring moving at a high circular velocity. This is supported by the clear rotation patterns in the HI absorption velocity field. The asymmetry of the absorption spectra can be caused by outflows or inflows of gas in the nuclear region of NGC 4945. The continuum map shows small extensions on both sides of the galaxy's major axis that might be signs of outflows resulting from the starburst activity."

In this paper, we consider the cell-free (CF) massive MIMO framework with implementing MEC functionalities. We consider multiple types of users with different average time requirements for computing/processing the tasks, and consider access points (APs) with MEC servers and a central server (CS) with the cloud computing capability. After deriving successful communication and computing probabilities using stochastic geometry and queueing theory, we present the successful edge computing probability (SECP) for a target computation latency. Through numerical results, we also analyze the impact of the AP coverage and the offloading probability to the CS on the SECP. It is observed that the optimal probability of offloading to the CS in terms of the SECP decreases with the AP coverage. Finally, we numerically characterize the minimum required energy consumption for guaranteeing a desired level of SECP. It is observed that for any desired level of SECP, it is more energy efficient to have larger number of APs as compared to having more number of antennas at each AP with smaller AP density."

    "title": "The Sample Allocation Problem and Non-Uniform Compressive Sampling",
    "summary": "This paper discusses sample allocation problem (SAP) in frequency-domain Compressive Sampling (CS) of time-domain signals. An analysis that is relied on two fundamental CS principles; the Uniform Random Sampling (URS) and the Uncertainty Principle (UP), is presented. We show that CS on a single- and multi-band signals performs better if the URS is done only within the band and suppress the out-band parts, compared to ordinary URS that ignore the band limits. It means that sampling should only be done at the signal support, while the non-support should be masked and suppressed in the reconstruction process. We also show that for an N-length discrete time signal with K-number of frequency components (Fourier coefficients), given the knowledge of the spectrum, URS leads to exact sampling on the location of the K-spectral peaks. These results are used to formulate a sampling scheme when the boundaries of the bands are not sharply distinguishable, such as in a triangular- or a stacked-band- spectral signals. When analyzing these cases, CS will face a paradox; in which narrowing the band leads to a more number of required samples, whereas widening it leads to lessen the number. Accordingly; instead of signal analysis by dividing the signal's spectrum vertically into bands of frequencies, slicing horizontally magnitude-wise yields less number of required sample and better reconstruction results. Moreover, it enables sample reuse that reduces the sample number even further. The horizontal slicing and sample reuse methods imply non-uniform random sampling, where larger-magnitude part of the spectrum should be allocated more sample than the lower ones."

In a CPE-CS instance, we are given several stochastic arms with unknown distributions, as well as a collection of possible decisions. Each decision has a reward according to the distributions of arms. The goal is to identify the decision with the maximum reward, using as few arm samples as possible. The problem generalizes the combinatorial pure exploration problem with linear rewards, which has attracted significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose an adaptive learning algorithm for the CPE-CS problem, and analyze its sample complexity. In particular, we introduce a new hardness measure called the consistent optimality hardness, and give both the upper and lower bounds of sample complexity. Moreover, we give examples to demonstrate that our solution has the capacity to deal with non-linear reward functions."

    "title": "Improving Robustness of Deep-Learning-Based Image Reconstruction",
    "summary": "Deep-learning-based methods for different applications have been shown vulnerable to adversarial examples. These examples make deployment of such models in safety-critical tasks questionable. Use of deep neural networks as inverse problem solvers has generated much excitement for medical imaging including CT and MRI, but recently a similar vulnerability has also been demonstrated for these tasks. We show that for such inverse problem solvers, one should analyze and study the effect of adversaries in the measurement-space, instead of the signal-space as in previous work. In this paper, we propose to modify the training strategy of end-to-end deep-learning-based inverse problem solvers to improve robustness. We introduce an auxiliary network to generate adversarial examples, which is used in a min-max formulation to build robust image reconstruction networks. Theoretically, we show for a linear reconstruction scheme the min-max formulation results in a singular-value(s) filter regularized solution, which suppresses the effect of adversarial examples occurring because of ill-conditioning in the measurement matrix. We find that a linear network using the proposed min-max learning scheme indeed converges to the same solution. In addition, for non-linear Compressed Sensing (CS) reconstruction using deep networks, we show significant improvement in robustness using the proposed approach over other methods. We complement the theory by experiments for CS on two different datasets and evaluate the effect of increasing perturbations on trained networks. We find the behavior for ill-conditioned and well-conditioned measurement matrices to be qualitatively different."

We demonstrate that the Arens extension defines an extension functor in this setting and that it forms an adjunction with the suitably defined forgetful functor. As a by-product of this categorical framework, we also revisit the work on Banach direct sums by Lachowicz and Moszyński (Semigroup Forum 93(1):34-70, 2016). This paper can be considered as a brief exploration of the triple interface between operator semigroups, Banach algebras, and category theory."

    "title": "Generalized Compressed Sensing for Image Reconstruction with Diffusion Probabilistic Models",

Well-established methods for optimizing such measurements include principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA) and compressed sensing (CS) based on random projections, all of which rely on axis- or subspace-aligned statistical characterization of the signal source. However, many naturally occurring signals, including photographic images, contain richer statistical structure. To exploit such structure, we introduce a general method for obtaining an optimized set of linear measurements for efficient image reconstruction, where the signal statistics are expressed by the prior implicit in a neural network trained to perform denoising (known as a \"diffusion model\"). We demonstrate that the optimal measurements derived for two natural image datasets differ from those of PCA, ICA, or CS, and result in substantially lower mean squared reconstruction error. Interestingly, the marginal distributions of the measurement values are asymmetrical (skewed), substantially more so than those of previous methods. We also find that optimizing with respect to perceptual loss, as quantified by structural similarity (SSIM), leads to measurements different from those obtained when optimizing for MSE. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating the specific statistical regularities of natural signals when designing effective linear measurements."

Additionally, serious games applications and broader categories of games can also adopt it. Additionally, we categorized the imminent challenges for CS minimization into four different items.

This approach finds use in imaging applications where full-frame sensors are either too expensive (e.g., for short-wave infrared wavelengths) or unavailable. Existing SMC systems reconstruct static scenes using techniques from compressive sensing (CS). For videos, however, existing acquisition and recovery methods deliver poor quality. In this paper, we propose the CS multi-scale video (CS-MUVI) sensing and recovery framework for high-quality video acquisition and recovery using SMCs. Our framework features novel sensing matrices that enable the efficient computation of a low-resolution video preview, while enabling high-resolution video recovery using convex optimization. To further improve the quality of the reconstructed videos, we extract optical-flow estimates from the low-resolution previews and impose them as constraints in the recovery procedure. We demonstrate the efficacy of our CS-MUVI framework for a host of synthetic and real measured SMC video data, and we show that high-quality videos can be recovered at roughly compression."

U.S.-based computer security research is no stranger to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in a relationship that is still evolving through case law, research practices, changing policies, and legislation. Amid the landscape computer scientists, lawyers, and policymakers have learned to navigate, anti-fraud laws are a surprisingly under-examined challenge for computer science research. Fraud brings separate issues that are not addressed by the methods for navigating CFAA, DMCA, and Terms of Service that are more familiar in the computer security literature. Although anti-fraud laws have been discussed to a limited extent in older research on phishing attacks, modern computer science researchers are left with little guidance when it comes to navigating issues of deception outside the context of pure laboratory research. In this paper, we analyze and taxonomize the anti-fraud and deception issues that arise in several areas of computer science research. We find that, despite the lack of attention to these issues in the legal and computer science literature, issues of misrepresented identity or false information that could implicate anti-fraud laws are actually relevant to many methodologies used in computer science research, including penetration testing, web scraping, user studies, sock puppets, social engineering, auditing AI or socio-technical systems, and attacks on artificial intelligence. We especially highlight the importance of anti-fraud laws in two research fields of great policy importance: attacking or auditing AI systems, and research involving legal identification."

The operation of folding is generalized in a way that the sequence can be folded into various shapes and not just a box. The new definition of folding is based on a lattice tiling for the given shape and a direction in the -dimensional integer grid. Necessary and sufficient conditions that a lattice tiling for combined with a direction define a folding of a sequence into are derived. The immediate and most impressive application is some new lower bounds on the number of dots in two-dimensional synchronization patterns. This can be also generalized for multidimensional synchronization patterns. The technique and its application for two-dimensional synchronization patterns, raise some interesting problems in discrete geometry. We will also discuss these problems.

In this work, we present word-embeddings trained on code-switched tweets, specifically those that make use of Spanish and English, known as Spanglish. We explore the embedding space to discover how they capture the meanings of words in both languages. We test the effectiveness of these embeddings by participating in SemEval 2020 Task 9: ~ Sentiment Analysis on Code-Mixed Social Media Text . We utilised them to train a sentiment classifier that achieves an F-1 score of 0.722. This is higher than the baseline for the competition of 0.656, with our team (codalab username francesita ) ranking 14 out of 29 participating teams, beating the baseline."

    "title": "A note on practical approximate projection schemes in signal space methods",
    "summary": "Compressive sensing (CS) is a new technology which allows the acquisition of signals directly in compressed form, using far fewer measurements than traditional theory dictates. Recently, many so-called signal space methods have been developed to extend this body of work to signals sparse in arbitrary dictionaries rather than orthonormal bases. In doing so, CS can be utilized in a much broader array of practical settings. Often, such approaches often rely on the ability to optimally project a signal onto a small number of dictionary atoms. Such optimal, or even approximate, projections have been difficult to derive theoretically. Nonetheless, it has been observed experimentally that conventional CS approaches can be used for such projections, and still provide accurate signal recovery. In this letter, we summarize the empirical evidence and clearly demonstrate for what signal types certain CS methods may be used as approximate projections. In addition, we provide theoretical guarantees for such methods for certain sparse signal structures. Our theoretical results match those observed in experimental studies, and we thus establish both experimentally and theoretically that these CS methods can be used in this context. abstract"

    "summary": "In this paper, we propose the cross splitting based information geometry approach (CS-IGA), a novel and low complexity iterative detector for uplink signal recovery in extralarge-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems. Conventional iterative detectors, such as the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm and the traditional information geometry algorithm (IGA), suffer from a per iteration complexity that scales with the number of base station (BS) antennas, creating a computational bottleneck. To overcome this, CS-IGA introduces a novel cross matrix splitting of the natural parameter in the a posteriori distribution. This factorization allows the iterative detection based on the matched filter, which reduces per iteration computational complexity. Furthermore, we extend this framework to nonlinear detection and propose nonlinear CSIGA (NCS-IGA) by seamlessly embedding discrete constellation constraints, enabling symbol-wise processing without external interference cancellation loops. Comprehensive simulations under realistic channel conditions demonstrate that CS-IGA matches or surpasses the bit error rate (BER) performance of Bayes optimal AMP and IGA for both linear and nonlinear detection, while achieving this with fewer iterations and a substantially lower computational cost. These results establish CS-IGA as a practical and powerful solution for high-throughput signal detection in next generation XL-MIMO systems."

The obtained resolution directly depends on the total bandwidth used, or equivalently, the number of transmitted pulses. This paper proposes a novel SFR system, namely SFR with compressive sampling (SFRCS), that achieves the same resolution as a conventional SFR, while using significantly reduced bandwidth, or equivalently, transmitting significantly fewer pulses. This bandwidth reduction is accomplished by employing compressive sampling ideas and exploiting the sparseness of targets in the range velocity space."

    "summary": "Electric Vehicles (EVs) are becoming more and more popular in our daily life, which replaces traditional fuel vehicles to reduce carbon emissions and protect the environment. EVs need to be charged, but the number of charging piles in a Charging Station (CS) is limited and charging is usually more time-consuming than fueling. According to this scenario, we propose a secure and efficient charging scheduling system based on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-blockchain and double auction mechanism. In a smart area, it attempts to assign EVs to the available CSs in the light of their submitted charging requests and status information. First, we design a lightweight charging scheduling framework that integrates DAG-blockchain and modern cryptography technology to ensure security and scalability during performing scheduling and completing tradings. In this process, a constrained multi-item double auction problem is formulated because of the limited charging resources in a CS, which motivates EVs and CSs in this area to participate in the market based on their preferences and statuses. Due to this constraint, our problem is more complicated and harder to achieve truthfulness as well as system efficiency compared to the existing double auction model. To adapt to it, we propose two algorithms, namely Truthful Mechanism for Charging (TMC) and Efficient Mechanism for Charging (EMC), to determine an assignment between EVs and CSs and pricing strategies. Then, both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show the correctness and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms."

SDA enables us to capture statistical dependencies between the different elements of certain signals and improve signal recovery performance as compared to the CS approach."

By contrast, our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach is trained to calculate video-to-video similarity from refined frame-to-frame similarity matrices, so as to consider both intra- and inter-frame relations. In the proposed method, pairwise frame similarity is estimated by applying Tensor Dot (TD) followed by Chamfer Similarity (CS) on regional CNN frame features - this avoids feature aggregation before the similarity calculation between frames. Subsequently, the similarity matrix between all video frames is fed to a four-layer CNN, and then summarized using Chamfer Similarity (CS) into a video-to-video similarity score -- this avoids feature aggregation before the similarity calculation between videos and captures the temporal similarity patterns between matching frame sequences. We train the proposed network using a triplet loss scheme and evaluate it on five public benchmark datasets on four different video retrieval problems where we demonstrate large improvements in comparison to the state of the art. The implementation of ViSiL is publicly available."

    "title": "GStex: Per-Primitive Texturing of 2D Gaussian Splatting for Decoupled Appearance and Geometry Modeling",
    "summary": "Gaussian splatting has demonstrated excellent performance for view synthesis and scene reconstruction. The representation achieves photorealistic quality by optimizing the position, scale, color, and opacity of thousands to millions of 2D or 3D Gaussian primitives within a scene. However, since each Gaussian primitive encodes both appearance and geometry, these attributes are strongly coupled--thus, high-fidelity appearance modeling requires a large number of Gaussian primitives, even when the scene geometry is simple (e.g., for a textured planar surface). We propose to texture each 2D Gaussian primitive so that even a single Gaussian can be used to capture appearance details. By employing per-primitive texturing, our appearance representation is agnostic to the topology and complexity of the scene's geometry. We show that our approach, GStex, yields improved visual quality over prior work in texturing Gaussian splats. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our decoupling enables improved novel view synthesis performance compared to 2D Gaussian splatting when reducing the number of Gaussian primitives, and that GStex can be used for scene appearance editing and re-texturing."

    "title": "Two algorithms for compressed sensing of sparse tensors",
    "summary": "Compressed sensing (CS) exploits the sparsity of a signal in order to integrate acquisition and compression. CS theory enables exact reconstruction of a sparse signal from relatively few linear measurements via a suitable nonlinear minimization process. Conventional CS theory relies on vectorial data representation, which results in good compression ratios at the expense of increased computational complexity. In applications involving color images, video sequences, and multi-sensor networks, the data is intrinsically of high-order, and thus more suitably represented in tensorial form. Standard applications of CS to higher-order data typically involve representation of the data as long vectors that are in turn measured using large sampling matrices, thus imposing a huge computational and memory burden. In this chapter, we introduce Generalized Tensor Compressed Sensing (GTCS)--a unified framework for compressed sensing of higher-order tensors which preserves the intrinsic structure of tensorial data with reduced computational complexity at reconstruction. We demonstrate that GTCS offers an efficient means for representation of multidimensional data by providing simultaneous acquisition and compression from all tensor modes. In addition, we propound two reconstruction procedures, a serial method (GTCS-S) and a parallelizable method (GTCS-P), both capable of recovering a tensor based on noiseless and noisy observations. We then compare the performance of the proposed methods with Kronecker compressed sensing (KCS) and multi-way compressed sensing (MWCS). We demonstrate experimentally that GTCS outperforms KCS and MWCS in terms of both reconstruction accuracy (within a range of compression ratios) and processing speed. The major disadvantage of our methods (and of MWCS as well), is that the achieved compression ratios may be worse than those offered by KCS."

Exploiting the inherent nature of sporadic transmissions in the grant-free NOMA systems, compressed sensing based multiuser detection (CS-MUD) has been deemed as a powerful solution to user activity detection (UAD) and data detection (DD). In this paper, block coordinate descend (BCD) method is employed in CS-MUD to reduce the computational complexity. We propose two modified BCD based algorithms, called enhanced BCD (EBCD) and complexity reduction enhanced BCD (CR-EBCD), respectively. To be specific, by incorporating a novel candidate set pruning mechanism into the original BCD framework, our proposed EBCD algorithm achieves remarkable CS-MUD performance improvement. In addition, the proposed CR-EBCD algorithm further ameliorates the proposed EBCD by eliminating the redundant matrix multiplications during the iteration process. As a consequence, compared with the proposed EBCD algorithm, our proposed CR-EBCD algorithm enjoys two orders of magnitude complexity saving without any CS-MUD performance degradation, rendering it a viable solution for future mMTC scenarios. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the bound-approaching performance as well as ultra-low computational complexity."

Results: Open interviews showed that the CS was preferred over the HMD for older normal-hearing participants and that video recordings were the preferred visual condition. Young and older hearing-impaired participants did not show a preference between the CS and the HMD.

Electroencephalograph (EEG), which can monitor the electrical activity of the brain, has been widely used in measuring the level of WM. However, one of the critical challenges is that individual differences may cause ineffective results, especially when the established model meets an unfamiliar subject. In this work, we propose a cross-subject deep adaptation model with spatial attention (CS-DASA) to generalize the workload classifications across subjects. First, we transform EEG time series into multi-frame EEG images incorporating spatial, spectral, and temporal information. First, the Subject-Shared module in CS-DASA receives multi-frame EEG image data from both source and target subjects and learns the common feature representations. Then, in the subject-specific module, the maximum mean discrepancy is implemented to measure the domain distribution divergence in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which can add an effective penalty loss for domain adaptation. Additionally, the subject-to-subject spatial attention mechanism is employed to focus on the discriminative spatial features from the target image data. Experiments conducted on a public WM EEG dataset containing 13 subjects show that the proposed model is capable of achieving better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods."

For the task of machine translation (MT), morphological segmentation has proven successful in alleviating data sparsity in monolingual contexts; however, it has not been investigated for CS settings. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of different segmentation approaches on MT performance, covering morphology-based and frequency-based segmentation techniques. We experiment on MT from code-switched Arabic-English to English. We provide detailed analysis, examining a variety of conditions, such as data size and sentences with different degrees of CS. Empirical results show that morphology-aware segmenters perform the best in segmentation tasks but under-perform in MT. Nevertheless, we find that the choice of the segmentation setup to use for MT is highly dependent on the data size. For extreme low-resource scenarios, a combination of frequency and morphology-based segmentations is shown to perform the best. For more resourced settings, such a combination does not bring significant improvements over the use of frequency-based segmentation."

Designers often utilize this dichotomy technique to communicate the nature of their aesthetic and semantic design concepts with stakeholders, especially in an early design development phase. The CSC assists this designers' cognitive activity by constructing a \"Character Space\" (\"CS\"), which is a semantic quadrant system, in a structured manner. A CS created by designers with the assistance of the CSC enables them to discern and explain their design concepts in contrast with opposing terms. These terms in a CS are retrieved and combined in the CSC by using a knowledge graph. The CSC presents terms and phrases as lists of candidates to users from which users will choose in order to define the target design concept, which is then visualized in a CS. The participants in our experiment, who were in the \"arts and design\" profession, were given two conditions under which to create DCPs and explain them. One group created and explained the DCPs with the assistance of the proposed CSC, and the other did the same task without this assistance, given the freedom to use any publicly available web search tools instead. The result showed that the group assisted by the CSC indicated their tasks were supported significantly better, especially in exploration, as measured by the Creativity Support Index (CSI)."

This massive galaxy (M M ) is falling along the line-of-sight towards the centre of a rich cluster (M M , km/s) at a high velocity 3363 km/s. Its H emission shows a 40 kpc tail confined closely to its stellar disc and a 100 kpc tail extending further out. We find HI emission coinciding only with the shorter clumpy H tail. In total, we measure an HI mass of M M , which is about 60% lower than expected based on its stellar mass and stellar surface density. We compared JO201 to another jellyfish in the GASP sample, JO206 (of similar mass but residing in a 10 less massive cluster), and find that they are similarly HI-deficient. Of the total HI mass in JO201, about 30% lies outside the galaxy disc in projection. This HI fraction is probably a lower limit since most of the HI is redshifted relative to the stellar disc and could be outside the disc. The global star formation rate (SFR) analysis of JO201 suggests that its observed SFR would be expected if it had 10 its current HI mass. The disc is the main contributor of the high star formation efficiency at a given HI gas density for both galaxies, but their tails also show higher star formation efficiencies compared to the outer regions of field galaxies. Generally, we find that JO201 and JO206 are similar based on their HI content, stellar mass and star formation rate. This finding is unexpected considering their different environments. A toy model comparing the ram pressure of the ICM versus the restoring forces of these galaxies suggests that the ram pressure strength exerted on them could be comparable if we consider their 3D orbital velocities and radial distances relative to the clusters."

The limited resource for low-resource languages remains a crucial challenge. Code-switching (CS), a phenomenon where multilingual speakers alternate between languages in a discourse, can convey subtle cultural and linguistic nuances that can be otherwise lost in translation and elicits language-specific knowledge in human communications. In light of this, we investigate whether code-switching can activate, or identify and leverage knowledge for reasoning when LLMs solve low-resource language tasks. To facilitate the research, we first present EnKoQA, a synthetic English-Korean CS question-answering dataset. We provide comprehensive analysis on a variety of multilingual LLMs by subdividing activation process into knowledge identification and knowledge leveraging. Our results demonstrate that compared to English text, CS can faithfully activate knowledge inside LLMs especially on language-specific domains, suggesting the potential of code-switching on low-resource language tasks."

It is essential to report the changes of each replication to understand the evolution of the experimental validity across a family of studies. Unfortunately, the lack of proposals undermines these objectives. Objective. The main goal of our work is to provide researchers in CS, and in other areas of research, with a systematic, tool-supported approach for the reporting of changes in the replications of their empirical studies. Method: Applying DSR, we have developed and validated a composite artifact consisting of (i) a metamodel of the relevant concepts of replications and their changes; (ii) templates and linguistic patterns for reporting those concepts; and (iii) a proof-of-concept model-based software tool that supports the proposed approach. For its validation, we have carried out a multiple case study including 9 families of empirical studies from CS and Agrobiology. The 9 families encompass 23 replication studies and 92 replication changes, for which we have analyzed the suitability of our proposal. Results: The multiple case study revealed some initial limitations of our approach related to threats to experimental validity or context variables. After several improvement iterations, all the 92 replication changes could be properly specified, including also their qualitatively estimated effects on experimental validity across the family of experiments and its corresponding visualization. Conclusions: Our proposal for the specification of replication changes seems to fit the needs not only of replications in CS, but also in other research areas. Nevertheless, further research is needed to improve it and to disseminate its use among the research community."

    "title": "A Divide-and-Conquer Approach to Compressed Sensing MRI",
    "summary": "Compressed sensing (CS) theory assures us that we can accurately reconstruct magnetic resonance images using fewer k-space measurements than the Nyquist sampling rate requires. In traditional CS-MRI inversion methods, the fact that the energy within the Fourier measurement domain is distributed non-uniformly is often neglected during reconstruction. As a result, more densely sampled low-frequency information tends to dominate penalization schemes for reconstructing MRI at the expense of high-frequency details. In this paper, we propose a new framework for CS-MRI inversion in which we decompose the observed k-space data into \"subspaces\" via sets of filters in a lossless way, and reconstruct the images in these various spaces individually using off-the-shelf algorithms. We then fuse the results to obtain the final reconstruction. In this way we are able to focus reconstruction on frequency information within the entire k-space more equally, preserving both high and low frequency details. We demonstrate that the proposed framework is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in CS-MRI in terms of quantitative performance, and often improves an algorithm's results qualitatively compared with it's direct application to k-space."

We propose an efficient reconstruction algorithm with the aid of other given sources as multiple side information (SI). The proposed algorithm takes advantage of compressive sensing (CS) with SI and adaptive weights by solving a proposed weighted - minimization. The proposed algorithm computes the adaptive weights in two levels, first each individual intra-SI and then inter-SI weights are iteratively updated at every reconstructed iteration. This two-level optimization leads the proposed reconstruction algorithm with multiple SI using adaptive weights (RAMSIA) to robustly exploit the multiple SIs with different qualities. We experimentally perform our algorithm on generated sparse signals and also correlated feature histograms as multiview sparse sources from a multiview image database. The results show that RAMSIA significantly outperforms both classical CS and CS with single SI, and RAMSIA with higher number of SIs gained more than the one with smaller number of SIs."

This paper aims to address language confusion for improving CS-ASR from two perspectives: incorporating and disentangling language information. We incorporate language information in the CS-ASR model by dynamically biasing the model with token-level language posteriors which are outputs of a sequence-to-sequence auxiliary language diarization module. In contrast, the disentangling process reduces the difference between languages via adversarial training so as to normalize two languages. We conduct the experiments on the SEAME dataset. Compared to the baseline model, both the joint optimization with LD and the language posterior bias achieve performance improvement. The comparison of the proposed methods indicates that incorporating language information is more effective than disentangling for reducing language confusion in CS speech."

The growing global demand for multilingual applications, including Code-Switching ASR (CSASR), Text-to-Speech (CSTTS), and Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR), highlights the inadequacy of existing monolingual datasets. Although some code-switching datasets exist, most are limited to bilingual mixing within homogeneous ethnic groups, leaving a critical need for a large-scale, diverse benchmark akin to ImageNet in computer vision. To bridge this gap, we introduce LinguaMaster , a multi-agent collaboration framework specifically designed for efficient and scalable multilingual data synthesis. Leveraging this framework, we curate SwitchLingua , the first large-scale multilingual and multi-ethnic code-switching dataset, including: (1) 420K CS textual samples across 12 languages, and (2) over 80 hours of audio recordings from 174 speakers representing 18 countries/regions and 63 racial/ethnic backgrounds, based on the textual data.

Our detailed overview of NAS&E from the viewpoints of rationale, foundations, and organization is preceded by a recounting of the role played by numerical analysts in the evolution of academic departments of computer science, in order to provide background for NAS&E and place the newly-emerging discipline within its larger historical context."

Traditional teaching methods and hands-on learning dominate this field, with limited use of playful and interactive learning methods such as educational games. This gap is particularly evident in game development as a subfield of CS. To address this problem, we present a game-based learning approach to teach foundational concepts for game development. The paper aims to expand the educational landscape within CSE, offering a unique and engaging platform for learners to explore the intricacies of game creation by integrating gamified learning strategies. In this paper, we investigate the user's learning experience and motivation, and the differences between traditional learning and game-based learning methods for teaching game development concepts. The study involves 57 participants in an AB test to assess learners' motivation, user experience, and learning outcomes. The results indicate a significantly increased learning outcome for the game-based learning approach, as well as higher motivation in learning game development concepts."

    "summary": "Camouflaged object detection (COD) remains a challenging task in computer vision. Existing methods often resort to additional branches for edge supervision, incurring substantial computational costs. To address this, we propose the Co-Supervised Spotlight Shifting Network (CS Net), a compact single-branch framework inspired by how shifting light source exposes camouflage. Our spotlight shifting strategy replaces multi-branch designs by generating supervisory signals that highlight boundary cues. Within CS Net, a Projection Aware Attention (PAA) module is devised to strengthen feature extraction, while the Extended Neighbor Connection Decoder (ENCD) enhances final predictions. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that CS Net not only achieves superior performance, but also reduces Multiply-Accumulate operations (MACs) by 32.13% compared to state-of-the-art COD methods, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and effectiveness."

    "summary": "In this paper, we propose clipping noise cancellation scheme using compressed sensing (CS) for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. In the proposed scheme, only the data tones with high reliability are exploited in reconstructing the clipping noise instead of the whole data tones. For reconstructing the clipping noise using a fraction of the data tones at the receiver, the CS technique is applied. The proposed scheme is also applicable to interleaved orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems due to the decomposition of fast Fourier transform (FFT) structure. Numerical analysis shows that the proposed scheme performs well for clipping noise cancellation of both OFDM and OFDMA systems."

    "title": "Measurement Matrix Design for Compressive Sensing Based MIMO Radar",
    "summary": "In colocated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar using compressive sensing (CS), a receive node compresses its received signal via a linear transformation, referred to as measurement matrix. The samples are subsequently forwarded to a fusion center, where an L1-optimization problem is formulated and solved for target information. CS-based MIMO radar exploits the target sparsity in the angle-Doppler-range space and thus achieves the high localization performance of traditional MIMO radar but with many fewer measurements. The measurement matrix is vital for CS recovery performance. This paper considers the design of measurement matrices that achieve an optimality criterion that depends on the coherence of the sensing matrix (CSM) and/or signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). The first approach minimizes a performance penalty that is a linear combination of CSM and the inverse SIR. The second one imposes a structure on the measurement matrix and determines the parameters involved so that the SIR is enhanced. Depending on the transmit waveforms, the second approach can significantly improve SIR, while maintaining CSM comparable to that of the Gaussian random measurement matrix (GRMM). Simulations indicate that the proposed measurement matrices can improve detection accuracy as compared to a GRMM."

    "title": "Deep Unfolding Network for Image Compressed Sensing by Content-adaptive Gradient Updating and Deformation-invariant Non-local Modeling",
    "summary": "Inspired by certain optimization solvers, the deep unfolding network (DUN) has attracted much attention in recent years for image compressed sensing (CS). However, there still exist the following two issues: 1) In existing DUNs, most hyperparameters are usually content independent, which greatly limits their adaptability for different input contents. 2) In each iteration, a plain convolutional neural network is usually adopted, which weakens the perception of wider context prior and therefore depresses the expressive ability. In this paper, inspired by the traditional Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm, a novel DUN for image compressed sensing (dubbed DUN-CSNet) is proposed to solve the above two issues. Specifically, for the first issue, a novel content adaptive gradient descent network is proposed, in which a well-designed step size generation sub-network is developed to dynamically allocate the corresponding step sizes for different textures of input image by generating a content-aware step size map, realizing a content-adaptive gradient updating. For the second issue, considering the fact that many similar patches exist in an image but have undergone a deformation, a novel deformation-invariant non-local proximal mapping network is developed, which can adaptively build the long-range dependencies between the nonlocal patches by deformation-invariant non-local modeling, leading to a wider perception on context priors. Extensive experiments manifest that the proposed DUN-CSNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art CS methods by large margins."

    "summary": "In this paper, an improved ALOHA-based unsourced random access (URA) scheme is proposed in MIMO channels. The channel coherent interval is divided into multiple sub-slots and each active user selects several sub-slots to send its codeword, namely, the channel access pattern. To be more specific, the data stream of each active user is divided into three parts. The first part is mapped as the compressed sensing (CS) pilot, which also serves for the consequent channel estimation. The second part is modulated by binary phase shift keying (BPSK). The obtained CS pilot and the antipodal BPSK signal are concatenated as its codeword. After that, the codeword of each active user is sent repeatedly based on its channel access pattern, which is determined by the third part of the information bits, namely, index modulation (IM). On the receiver side, a hard decision-based decoder is proposed which includes the CS decoder, maximal likelihood (ML)-based superposed codeword decomposer (SCD), and IM demodulator. To further reduce the complexity of the proposed decoder, a simplified SCD based on convex approximation is considered. The performance analysis is also provided. The exhaustive computer simulations confirm the superiority of our proposal."

    "title": "CSQF-based Time-Sensitive Flow Scheduling in Long-distance Industrial IoT Networks",
    "summary": "Booming time-critical services, such as automated manufacturing and remote operations, stipulate increasing demands for facilitating large-scale Industrial Internet of Things (IoT). Recently, a cycle specified queuing and forwarding (CSQF) scheme has been advocated to enhance the Ethernet. However, CSQF only outlines a foundational equipment-level primitive, while how to attain network-wide flow scheduling is not yet determined. Prior endeavors primarily focus on the range of a local area, rendering them unsuitable for long-distance factory interconnection. This paper devises the cycle tags planning (CTP) mechanism, the first integer programming model for the CSQF, which makes the CSQF practical for efficient global flow scheduling. In the CTP model, the per-hop cycle alignment problem is solved by decoupling the long-distance link delay from cyclic queuing time. To avoid queue overflows, we discretize the underlying network resources into cycle-related queue resource blocks and detail the core constraints within multiple periods. Then, two heuristic algorithms named flow offset and cycle shift (FO-CS) and Tabu FO-CS are designed to calculate the flows' cycle tags and maximize the number of schedulable flows, respectively. Evaluation results show that FO-CS increases the number of scheduled flows by 31.2%. The Tabu FO-CS algorithm can schedule 94.45% of flows at the level of 2000 flows."

In this paper we study the problem of simultaneously recovering multiple spectrally-sparse signals that are supported on the same frequencies lying arbitrarily on the unit circle. We propose an atomic norm minimization problem, which can be regarded as a continuous counterpart of the discrete CS formulation and be solved efficiently via semidefinite programming. Through numerical experiments, we show that the number of samples per signal may be further reduced by harnessing the joint sparsity pattern of multiple signals."

    "title": "Regime Change: Bit-Depth versus Measurement-Rate in Compressive Sensing",
    "summary": "The recently introduced compressive sensing (CS) framework enables digital signal acquisition systems to take advantage of signal structures beyond bandlimitedness. Indeed, the number of CS measurements required for stable reconstruction is closer to the order of the signal complexity than the Nyquist rate. To date, the CS theory has focused on real-valued measurements, but in practice, measurements are mapped to bits from a finite alphabet. Moreover, in many potential applications the total number of measurement bits is constrained, which suggests a tradeoff between the number of measurements and the number of bits per measurement. We study this situation in this paper and show that there exist two distinct regimes of operation that correspond to high/low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In the measurement compression (MC) regime, a high SNR favors acquiring fewer measurements with more bits per measurement; in the quantization compression (QC) regime, a low SNR favors acquiring more measurements with fewer bits per measurement. A surprise from our analysis and experiments is that in many practical applications it is better to operate in the QC regime, even acquiring as few as 1 bit per measurement."

    "title": "CSSF MIMO RADAR: Low-Complexity Compressive Sensing Based MIMO Radar That Uses Step Frequency",
    "summary": "A new approach is proposed, namely CSSF MIMO radar, which applies the technique of step frequency (SF) to compressive sensing (CS) based multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar. The proposed approach enables high resolution range, angle and Doppler estimation, while transmitting narrowband pulses. The problem of joint angle-Doppler-range estimation is first formulated to fit the CS framework, i.e., as an L1 optimization problem. Direct solution of this problem entails high complexity as it employs a basis matrix whose construction requires discretization of the angle-Doppler-range space. Since high resolution requires fine space discretization, the complexity of joint range, angle and Doppler estimation can be prohibitively high. For the case of slowly moving targets, a technique is proposed that achieves significant complexity reduction by successively estimating angle-range and Doppler in a decoupled fashion and by employing initial estimates obtained via matched filtering to further reduce the space that needs to be digitized. Numerical results show that the combination of CS and SF results in a MIMO radar system that has superior resolution and requires far less data as compared to a system that uses a matched filter with SF."

    "summary": "Due to their ability to create favorable line-of-sight (LoS) propagation environments, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are regarded as promising enablers for future millimeter-wave (mm-wave) wireless communication. In this paper, we investigate channel estimation for IRS-assisted mm-wave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) black wireles s systems. By leveraging the sparsity of mm-wave channels in the angular domain, we formulate the channel estimation problem as an -norm regularized optimization problem with fixed-rank constraints. To tackle the non-convexity of the formulated problem, an efficient algorithm is proposed by capitalizing on alternating minimization and manifold optimization (MO), which yields a locally optimal solution. To further reduce the computational complexity of the estimation algorithm, we propose a compressive sensing- (CS-) based channel estimation approach. In particular, a three-stage estimation protocol is put forward where the subproblem in each stage can be solved via low-complexity CS methods. Furthermore, based on the acquired channel state information (CSI) of the cascaded channel, we design a passive beamforming algorithm for maximization of the spectral efficiency. Simulation results reveal that the proposed MO-based estimation (MO-EST) and beamforming algorithms significantly outperform two benchmark schemes while the CS-based estimation (CS-EST) algorithm strikes a balance between performance and complexity. In addition, we demonstrate the robustness of the MO-EST algorithm with respect to imperfect knowledge of the sparsity level of the channels, which is crucial for practical implementations."

Their representative and generative abilities learnt from vast amounts of data can be easily adapted and transferred to a wide range of downstream tasks without extra training from scratch. However, leveraging FMs in cross-modal generation remains under-researched when audio modality is involved. On the other hand, automatically generating semantically-relevant sound from visual input is an important problem in cross-modal generation studies. To solve this vision-to-audio (V2A) generation problem, existing methods tend to design and build complex systems from scratch using modestly sized datasets. In this paper, we propose a lightweight solution to this problem by leveraging foundation models, specifically CLIP, CLAP, and AudioLDM. We first investigate the domain gap between the latent space of the visual CLIP and the auditory CLAP models. Then we propose a simple yet effective mapper mechanism (V2A-Mapper) to bridge the domain gap by translating the visual input between CLIP and CLAP spaces. Conditioned on the translated CLAP embedding, pretrained audio generative FM AudioLDM is adopted to produce high-fidelity and visually-aligned sound. Compared to previous approaches, our method only requires a quick training of the V2A-Mapper. We further analyze and conduct extensive experiments on the choice of the V2A-Mapper and show that a generative mapper is better at fidelity and variability (FD) while a regression mapper is slightly better at relevance (CS). Both objective and subjective evaluation on two V2A datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared to current state-of-the-art approaches - trained with 86% fewer parameters but achieving 53% and 19% improvement in FD and CS, respectively."

On the positive side, we give an efficient algorithm to compute the cosecure domination number of chain graphs, which is an important subclass of bipartite graphs. In addition, we show that the problem is linear-time solvable for bounded tree-width graphs. Further, we prove that the computational complexity of this problem varies from the domination problem."

In this paper, we consider 1-bit CS over noisy WSNs subject to channel-induced bit flipping errors, and propose an amplitude-aided signal reconstruction scheme, by which (i) the representation points of local binary quantizers are designed to minimize the loss of data fidelity caused by local sensing noise, quantization, and bit sign flipping, and (ii) the fusion center adopts the conventional minimization method for sparse signal recovery using the decoded and de-mapped binary data. The representation points of binary quantizers are designed by minimizing the mean square error (MSE) of the net data mismatch, taking into account the distributions of the nonzero signal entries, local sensing noise, quantization error, and bit flipping; a simple closed-form solution is then obtained. Numerical simulations show that our method improves the estimation accuracy when SNR is low or the number of sensors is small, as compared to state-of-the-art 1-bit CS algorithms relying solely on the sign message for signal recovery."

Recently, Compressed Sampling (CS) techniques, which exploit the sparsity of signals, have allowed to reconstruct signal and images with less measurements than the traditional Nyquist sensing approach. However, multichannel signals like Hyperspectral images (HSI) have additional structures, like inter-channel correlations, that are not taken into account in the classical CS scheme. In this paper we exploit the linear mixture of sources model, that is the assumption that the multichannel signal is composed of a linear combination of sources, each of them having its own spectral signature, and propose new sampling schemes exploiting this model to considerably decrease the number of measurements needed for the acquisition and source separation. Moreover, we give theoretical lower bounds on the number of measurements required to perform reconstruction of both the multichannel signal and its sources. We also proposed optimization algorithms and extensive experimentation on our target application which is HSI, and show that our approach recovers HSI with far less measurements and computational effort than traditional CS approaches."

    "summary": "Compressed sensing (CS) has become a popular field in the last two decades to represent and reconstruct a sparse signal with much fewer samples than the signal itself. Although regular images are not sparse on their own, many can be sparsely represented in wavelet transform domain. Therefore, CS has also been widely applied to represent digital images. However, an alternative approach, adaptive sampling such as mesh-based image representation (MbIR), has not attracted as much attention. MbIR works directly on image pixels and represents the image with fewer points using a triangular mesh. In this paper, we perform a preliminary comparison between the CS and a recently developed MbIR method, AMA representation. The results demonstrate that, at the same sample density, AMA representation can provide better reconstruction quality than CS based on the tested algorithms. Further investigation with recent algorithms is needed to perform a thorough comparison."

    "title": "Multiple and single snapshot compressive beamforming",
    "summary": "For a sound field observed on a sensor array, compressive sensing (CS) reconstructs the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of multiple sources using a sparsity constraint. The DOA estimation is posed as an underdetermined problem by expressing the acoustic pressure at each sensor as a phase-lagged superposition of source amplitudes at all hypothetical DOAs. Regularizing with an -norm constraint renders the problem solvable with convex optimization, and promoting sparsity gives high-resolution DOA maps. Here, the sparse source distribution is derived using maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates for both single and multiple snapshots. CS does not require inversion of the data covariance matrix and thus works well even for a single snapshot where it gives higher resolution than conventional beamforming. For multiple snapshots, CS outperforms conventional high-resolution methods, even with coherent arrivals and at low signal-to-noise ratio. The superior resolution of CS is demonstrated with vertical array data from the SWellEx96 experiment for coherent multi-paths."

Conventional grid-based compressed sensing (CS) methods for mmWave channel estimation suffer from the basis mismatch problem, which prevents accurate channel reconstruction and degrades the precoding performance. This paper formulates mmWave channel estimation as an Atomic Norm Minimization (ANM) problem. In contrast to grid-based CS methods which use discrete dictionaries, ANM uses a continuous dictionary for representing the mmWave channel. We consider a continuous dictionary based on sub-sampling in the antenna domain via a small number of radio frequency chains. We show that mmWave channel estimation using ANM can be formulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, and the user channel can be accurately estimated via off-the-shelf SDP solvers in polynomial time. Simulation results indicate that ANM can achieve much better estimation accuracy compared to grid-based CS, and significantly improves the spectral efficiency provided by multi-user precoding."

MC sampling has gained renewed interest in the Compressive Sensing (CS) community, due partly to the fact that in the frequency domain, MC sampling bears a strong resemblance to other sub-Nyquist CS acquisition protocols. In this paper, we consider MC sampling of analog frequency hopping signals, which can be viewed as multiband signals with changing band positions. This nonstationarity motivates our consideration of a segment-based reconstruction framework, in which the sample stream is broken into short segments for reconstruction. In contrast, previous works focusing on the reconstruction of multiband signals have used a segment-less reconstruction framework such as the modified MUSIC algorithm. We outline the challenges associated with segment-based recovery of frequency hopping signals from MC samples, and we explain how these challenges can be addressed using conventional CS recovery techniques. We also demonstrate the utility of the Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences (DPSS's) as an efficient dictionary for reducing the computational complexity of segment-based reconstruction."

However, most existing methods require the structures of two monolingual ASR models (MAMs) should be the same and only use the encoder of MAMs. This leads to the problem that pre-trained MAMs cannot be timely and fully used for CS ASR. In this paper, we propose a monolingual recognizers fusion method for CS ASR. It has two stages: the speech awareness (SA) stage and the language fusion (LF) stage. In the SA stage, acoustic features are mapped to two language-specific predictions by two independent MAMs. To keep the MAMs focused on their own language, we further extend the language-aware training strategy for the MAMs. In the LF stage, the BELM fuses two language-specific predictions to get the final prediction. Moreover, we propose a text simulation strategy to simplify the training process of the BELM and reduce reliance on CS data. Experiments on a Mandarin-English corpus show the efficiency of the proposed method. The mix error rate is significantly reduced on the test set after using open-source pre-trained MAMs."

It consists of two main steps: cell search (CS) on the downlink and random access (RA) on the uplink. Millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular systems typically must rely on directional beamforming (BF) in order to create a viable connection. The beamforming direction must therefore be learned-as well as used-in the initial access process for mmWave cellular networks. This paper considers four simple but representative initial access protocols that use various combinations of directional beamforming and omnidirectional transmission and reception at the mobile and the BS, during the CS and RA phases. We provide a system-level analysis of the success probability for CS and RA for each one, as well as of the initial access delay and user-perceived downlink throughput (UPT). For a baseline exhaustive search protocol, we find the optimal BS beamwidth and observe that in terms of initial access delay it is decreasing as blockage becomes more severe, but is relatively constant (about ) for UPT. Of the considered protocols, the best trade-off between initial access delay and UPT is achieved under a fast cell search protocol."

In this work, we combine ideas from CS, TL and DL reconstructions to learn deep linear convolutional transforms as part of an algorithm unrolling approach. Using end-to-end training, our results show that the proposed technique can reconstruct MR images to a level comparable to DL methods, while supporting uniform undersampling patterns unlike conventional CS methods.

Since the emergence of BCS, dictionary learning, a.k.a. sparse coding, has been studied as a matrix factorization problem where its sample complexity, uniqueness and identifiability have been addressed thoroughly. However, in spite of the strong connections between BCS and sparse coding, recent results from the sparse coding problem area have not been exploited within the context of BCS. In particular, prior BCS efforts have focused on learning constrained and complete dictionaries that limit the scope and utility of these efforts. In this paper, we develop new theoretical bounds for perfect recovery for the general unconstrained BCS problem. These unconstrained BCS bounds cover the case of overcomplete dictionaries, and hence, they go well beyond the existing BCS theory. Our perfect recovery results integrate the combinatorial theories of sparse coding with some of the recent results from low-rank matrix recovery. In particular, we propose an efficient CS measurement scheme that results in practical recovery bounds for BCS. Moreover, we discuss the performance of BCS under polynomial-time sparse coding algorithms."

    "summary": "We studied patterns of authorship in computer science~(CS) research in the Philippines by using data mining and graph theory techniques on archives of scientific papers presented in the Philippine Computer Science Congresses from 2000 to 2010 involving 326~papers written by 605~authors. We inferred from these archives various graphs namely, a paper--author bipartite graph, a co-authorship graph, and two mixing graphs. Our results show that the scientific articles by Filipino computer scientists were generated at a rate of 33~papers per year, while the papers were written by an average of 2.64~authors (maximum=13). The frequency distribution of the number of authors per paper follows a power-law with a power of ( ). The number of Filipino CS researchers increases at an annual rate of 60~new scientists. The researchers have written an average of 1.42~papers (maximum=20) and have collaborated with 3.70~other computer scientists (maximum=54). The frequency distribution of the number of papers per author follows a power law with ( ). This distribution closely agrees with Lotka's law of scientific productivity having . The number of co-authors per author also follows a power-law with ( ). These results suggest that most CS~papers in the country were written by scientists who prefer to work alone or at most in small groups. These also suggest that few papers were written by scientists who were involved in large collaboration efforts. The productivity of the Philippines' CS researchers, as measured by their number of papers, is positively correlated with their participation in collaborative research efforts, as measured by their number of co-authors (Pearson )."

    "title": "Assessing the Effectiveness of Selective Marketing to Broaden Participation in CS Education",
    "summary": "Many studies have aimed to broaden participation in computing (BPC) through extracurricular educational initiatives. When these initiatives are structured as open-enrollment extracurricular programs, their success often depends on their marketing approach. However, there is little in the computing education research literature about how to conduct effective marketing for these initiatives. We describe the changes made to the marketing strategy of one such program, an educational hackathon for middle school and high school students in the Pacific Northwest. These included reducing promotion to affluent families, using targeted school-based communication, and emphasizing cost supports during initial promotion. We then compare attendance and self-reported demographics before and after the intervention. Results indicate a higher proportion of students from marginalized and low-income communities and no reduction in overall attendance."

    "title": "Fault Localization from the Semantic Code Search Perspective",
    "summary": "The software development process is characterized by an iterative cycle of continuous functionality implementation and debugging, essential for the enhancement of software quality and adaptability to changing requirements. This process incorporates two isolatedly studied tasks: Code Search (CS), which retrieves reference code from a code corpus to aid in code implementation, and Fault Localization (FL), which identifies code entities responsible for bugs within the software project to boost software debugging. These two tasks exhibit similarities since they both address search problems. Notably, CS techniques have demonstrated greater effectiveness than FL ones, possibly because of the precise semantic details of the required code offered by natural language queries, which are not readily accessible to FL methods. Drawing inspiration from this, we hypothesize that a fault localizer could achieve greater proficiency if semantic information about the buggy methods were made available. Based on this idea, we propose CosFL, an FL approach that decomposes the FL task into two steps: query generation, which describes the functionality of the problematic code in natural language, and fault retrieval, which uses CS to find program elements semantically related to the query. Specifically, to depict the buggy functionalities and generate high-quality queries, CosFL extensively harnesses the code analysis, semantic comprehension, and decision-making capabilities of LLMs. Moreover, to enhance the accuracy of CS, CosFL captures varying levels of context information and employs a multi-granularity code search strategy, which facilitates a more precise identification of buggy methods from a holistic view. The evaluation on 835 real bugs from 23 Java projects shows that CosFL successfully localizes 324 bugs within Top-1, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by 26.6%-57.3%."

Hence, CS can be thought of as a natural candidate for acquisition of multidimensional signals, as the amount of data acquired and processed by conventional sensors could create problems in terms of computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a framework for the acquisition and reconstruction of multidimensional correlated signals. The approach is general and can be applied to D dimensional signals, even if the algorithms we propose to practically implement such architectures apply to 2-D and 3-D signals. The proposed architectures employ iterative local signal reconstruction based on a hybrid transform/prediction correlation model, coupled with a proper initialization strategy."

Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS) domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED. The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY, ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark, we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI relation between them in model training improves their performance on scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub."

    "summary": "In this paper, a new class of circulant matrices built from deterministic sequences is proposed for convolution-based compressed sensing (CS). In contrast to random convolution, the coefficients of the underlying filter are given by the discrete Fourier transform of a deterministic sequence with good autocorrelation. Both uniform recovery and non-uniform recovery of sparse signals are investigated, based on the coherence parameter of the proposed sensing matrices. Many examples of the sequences are investigated, particularly the Frank-Zadoff-Chu (FZC) sequence, the m -sequence and the Golay sequence. A salient feature of the proposed sensing matrices is that they can not only handle sparse signals in the time domain, but also those in the frequency and/or or discrete-cosine transform (DCT) domain."

    "summary": "Deep networks have achieved remarkable success in image compressed sensing (CS) task, namely reconstructing a high-fidelity image from its compressed measurement. However, existing works are deficient inincoherent compressed measurement at sensing phase and implicit measurement representations at reconstruction phase, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we answer two questions: 1) how to improve the measurement incoherence for decreasing the ill-posedness; 2) how to learn informative representations from measurements. To this end, we propose a novel asymmetric Kronecker CS (AKCS) model and theoretically present its better incoherence than previous Kronecker CS with minimal complexity increase. Moreover, we reveal that the unfolding networks' superiority over non-unfolding ones result from sufficient gradient descents, called explicit measurement representations. We propose a measurement-aware cross attention (MACA) mechanism to learn implicit measurement representations. We integrate AKCS and MACA into widely-used unfolding architecture to get a measurement-enhanced unfolding network (MEUNet). Extensive experiences demonstrate that our MEUNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction accuracy and inference speed."

    "title": "Modeling, Analysis, and Optimization of Grant-Free NOMA in Massive MTC via Stochastic Geometry",
    "summary": "Massive machine-type communications (mMTC) is a crucial scenario to support booming Internet of Things (IoTs) applications. In mMTC, although a large number of devices are registered to an access point (AP), very few of them are active with uplink short packet transmission at the same time, which requires novel design of protocols and receivers to enable efficient data transmission and accurate multi-user detection (MUD). Aiming at this problem, grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (GF-NOMA) protocol is proposed. In GF-NOMA, active devices can directly transmit their preambles and data symbols altogether within one time frame, without grant from the AP. Compressive sensing (CS)-based receivers are adopted for non-orthogonal preambles (NOP)-based MUD, and successive interference cancellation is exploited to decode the superimposed data signals. In this paper, we model, analyze, and optimize the CS-based GF-MONA mMTC system via stochastic geometry (SG), from an aspect of network deployment. Based on the SG network model, we first analyze the success probability as well as the channel estimation error of the CS-based MUD in the preamble phase and then analyze the average aggregate data rate in the data phase. As IoT applications highly demands low energy consumption, low infrastructure cost, and flexible deployment, we optimize the energy efficiency and AP coverage efficiency of GF-NOMA via numerical methods. The validity of our analysis is verified via Monte Carlo simulations. Simulation results also show that CS-based GF-NOMA with NOP yields better MUD and data rate performances than contention-based GF-NOMA with orthogonal preambles and CS-based grant-free orthogonal multiple access."

We first assume that resides in a space of generalized graph Laplacian matrices corresponding to balanced signed graphs. that is also PD is called a graph metric matrix. Unlike low-rank metric matrices common in the literature, includes the important diagonal-only matrices as a special case. The key theorem to circumvent full eigen-decomposition and enable fast metric matrix optimization is Gershgorin disc perfect alignment (GDPA): given and diagonal matrix , where and is 's first eigenvector, we prove that Gershgorin disc left-ends of similarity transform are perfectly aligned at the smallest eigenvalue . Using this theorem, we replace the PD cone constraint in the metric learning problem with tightest possible linear constraints per iteration, so that the alternating optimization of the diagonal / off-diagonal terms in can be solved efficiently as linear programs via the Frank-Wolfe method. We update using Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (LOBPCG) with warm start as entries in are optimized successively. Experiments show that our graph metric optimization is significantly faster than cone-projection schemes, and produces competitive binary classification performance."

    "title": "Towards a More Accurate Carrier Sensing Model for CSMA Wireless Networks",
    "summary": "This work calls into question a substantial body of past work on CSMA wireless networks. In the majority of studies on CSMA wireless networks, a contention graph is used to model the carrier sensing relationships (CS) among links. This is a 0-1 model in which two links can either sense each other completely or not. In real experiments, we observed that this is generally not the case: the CS relationship between the links are often probabilistic and can vary dynamically over time. This is the case even if the distance between the links is fixed and there is no drastic change in the environment. Furthermore, this partial carrier sensing relationship is prevalent and occurs over a wide range of distances between the links. This observation is not consistent with the 0-1 contention graph and implies that many results and conclusions drawn from previous theoretical studies need to be re-examined. This paper establishes a more accurate CS model with the objective of laying down a foundation for future theoretical studies that reflect reality. Towards that end, we set up detailed experiments to investigate the partial carrier sensing phenomenon. We discuss the implications and the use of our partial carrier sensing model in network analysis."

Compressive sensing (CS) promises to be able to deal with it. Nearly all the current CS based compressive wideband spectrum sensing methods exploit only the frequency sparsity to perform. Motivated by the achievement of a fast and robust detection of the wideband spectrum change, total variation mnimization is incorporated to exploit the temporal and frequency structure information to enhance the sparse level. As a sparser vector is obtained, the spectrum sensing period would be shorten and sensing accuracy would be enhanced. Both theoretical evaluation and numerical experiments can demonstrate the performance improvement."

By exploiting sparsity in the delay-Doppler domain, CS-based channel estimation allows for an increase in spectral efficiency through a reduction of the number of pilot symbols. For combating leakage effects that limit the delay-Doppler sparsity, we propose a sparsity-enhancing basis expansion and a method for optimizing the basis with or without prior statistical information about the channel. We also present an alternative CS-based channel estimator for (potentially) strongly time-frequency dispersive channels, which is capable of estimating the \"off-diagonal\" channel coefficients characterizing intersymbol and intercarrier interference (ISI/ICI). For this estimator, we propose a basis construction combining Fourier (exponential) and prolate spheroidal sequences. Simulation results assess the performance gains achieved by the proposed sparsity-enhancing processing techniques and by explicit estimation of ISI/ICI channel coefficients."

    "summary": "This paper presents a memory efficient VLSI architecture of low complex video encoder using three dimensional (3-D) wavelet and Compressed Sensing (CS) is proposed for space and low power video applications. Majority of the conventional video coding schemes are based on hybrid model, which requires complex operations like transform coding (DCT), motion estimation and deblocking filter at the encoder. Complexity of the proposed encoder is reduced by replacing those complex operations by 3-D DWT and CS at the encoder. The proposed architecture uses 3-D DWT to enable the scalability with levels of wavelet decomposition and also to exploit the spatial and the temporal redundancies. CS provides the good error resilience and coding efficiency. At the first stage of the proposed architecture for encoder, 3-D DWT has been applied (Lifting based 2-D DWT in spatial domain and Haar wavelet in temporal domain) on each frame of the group of frames (GOF), and in the second stage CS module exploits the sparsity of the wavelet coefficients. Small set of linear measurements are extracted by projecting the sparse 3-D wavelet coefficients onto random Bernoulli matrix at the encoder. Compared with the best existing 3-D DWT architectures, the proposed architecture for 3-D DWT requires less memory and provide high throughput. For an N?N image, the proposed 3-D DWT architecture consumes a total of only 2?(3N +40P) words of on-chip memory for the one level of decomposition. The proposed architecture for an encoder is first of its kind and to the best of my knowledge, no architecture is noted for comparison. The proposed VLSI architecture of the encoder has been synthesized on 90-nm CMOS process technology and results show that it consumes 90.08 mW power and occupies an area equivalent to 416.799 K equivalent gate at frequency of 158 MHz."

The developed techniques allow for semi-automatic population of a financial knowledge base, which, in turn, may be used to support a range of data mining and exploration tasks. The key challenge we face in this domain is that the same event is often reported multiple times, with varying correctness of details. We address this challenge by first collecting all information pertinent to a given event from the entire corpus, then considering all possible representations of the event, and finally, using a supervised learning method, to rank these representations by the associated confidence scores. A main innovative element of our approach is that it jointly extracts and stores all attributes of the event as a single representation (quintuple). Using a purpose-built test set we demonstrate that our supervised learning approach can achieve 25% improvement in F1-score over baseline methods that consider the earliest, the latest or the most frequent reporting of the event."

Specifically, we first introduce CS-based and CS clustering-based decentralized federated energy learning (DFEL) approaches which enable the CSs to train their own energy transactions locally to predict energy demands. In this way, each CS can exchange its learned model with other CSs to improve prediction accuracy without revealing actual datasets and reduce communication overhead among the CSs. Based on the energy demand prediction, we then design a multi-principal one-agent (MPOA) contract-based method. In particular, we formulate the CSs' utility maximization as a non-collaborative energy contract problem in which each CS maximizes its utility under common constraints from the smart grid provider (SGP) and other CSs' contracts. Then, we prove the existence of an equilibrium contract solution for all the CSs and develop an iterative algorithm at the SGP to find the equilibrium. Through simulation results using the dataset of CSs' transactions in Dundee city, the United Kingdom between 2017 and 2018, we demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve the energy demand prediction accuracy improvement up to 24.63% and lessen communication overhead by 96.3% compared with other machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, our proposed method can outperform non-contract-based economic models by 35% and 36% in terms of the CSs' utilities and social welfare of the network, respectively."

Furthermore, for a stationary camera, a further refined tracker is designed by integrating a CS-based background model (CSBM). This CSBM-equipped tracker coined as RTCST-B, outperforms most state-of-the-arts with respect to both accuracy and robustness.

However, this model usually suffers from some limits, such as dictionary learning with great computational complexity, neglecting the relationship among similar patches. In this paper, a group-based sparse representation method with non-convex regularization (GSR-NCR) for image CS reconstruction is proposed. In GSR-NCR, the local sparsity and nonlocal self-similarity of images is simultaneously considered in a unified framework. Different from the previous methods based on sparsity-promoting convex regularization, we extend the non-convex weighted Lp (0 < p < 1) penalty function on group sparse coefficients of the data matrix, rather than conventional L1-based regularization. To reduce the computational complexity, instead of learning the dictionary with a high computational complexity from natural images, we learn the principle component analysis (PCA) based dictionary for each group. Moreover, to make the proposed scheme tractable and robust, we have developed an efficient iterative shrinkage/thresholding algorithm to solve the non-convex optimization problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms many state-of-the-art techniques for image CS reconstruction."

    "title": "A Practical Study of Longitudinal Reference Based Compressed Sensing for MRI",
    "summary": "Compressed sensing (CS) is a new signal acquisition paradigm that enables the reconstruction of signals and images from a low number of samples. A particularly exciting application of CS is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), where CS significantly speeds up scan time by requiring far fewer measurements than standard MRI techniques. Such a reduction in sampling time leads to less power consumption, less need for patient sedation, and more accurate images. This accuracy increase is especially pronounced in pediatric MRI where patients have trouble being still for long scan periods. Although such gains are already significant, even further improvements can be made by utilizing past MRI scans of the same patient. Many patients require repeated scans over a period of time in order to track illnesses and the prior scans can be used as references for the current image. This allows samples to be taken adaptively, based on both the prior scan and the current measurements. Work by Weizman has shown that so-called reference based adaptive-weighted temporal Compressed Sensing MRI (LACS-MRI) requires far fewer samples than standard Compressed Sensing (CS) to achieve the same reconstruction signal-to-noise ratio (RSNR). The method uses a mixture of reference-based and adaptive-sampling. In this work, we test this methodology by using various adaptive sensing schemes, reconstruction methods, and image types. We create a thorough catalog of reconstruction behavior and success rates that is interesting from a mathematical point of view and is useful for practitioners. We also solve a grayscale compensation toy problem that supports the insensitivity of LACS-MRI to changes in MRI acquisition parameters and thus showcases the reliability of LACS-MRI in possible clinical situations."

    "summary": "Training Artificial Neural Networks poses a challenging and critical problem in machine learning. Despite the effectiveness of gradient-based learning methods, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), in training neural networks, they do have several limitations. For instance, they require differentiable activation functions, and cannot optimize a model based on several independent non-differentiable loss functions simultaneously; for example, the F1-score, which is used during testing, can be used during training when a gradient-free optimization algorithm is utilized. Furthermore, the training in any DNN can be possible with a small size of the training dataset. To address these concerns, we propose an efficient version of the gradient-free Coordinate Search (CS) algorithm, an instance of General Pattern Search methods, for training neural networks. The proposed algorithm can be used with non-differentiable activation functions and tailored to multi-objective/multi-loss problems. Finding the optimal values for weights of ANNs is a large-scale optimization problem. Therefore instead of finding the optimal value for each variable, which is the common technique in classical CS, we accelerate optimization and convergence by bundling the weights. In fact, this strategy is a form of dimension reduction for optimization problems. Based on the experimental results, the proposed method, in some cases, outperforms the gradient-based approach, particularly, in situations with insufficient labeled training data. The performance plots demonstrate a high convergence rate, highlighting the capability of our suggested method to find a reasonable solution with fewer function calls. As of now, the only practical and efficient way of training ANNs with hundreds of thousands of weights is gradient-based algorithms such as SGD or Adam. In this paper we introduce an alternative method for training ANN."

Conventional data compression methodologies, although effective in data compression, consumes significant energy and cannot reduce device cost. Compressed sensing (CS), as an emerging data compression methodology, is promising in catering to these constraints. However, EEG is non-sparse in the time domain and also non-sparse in transformed domains (such as the wavelet domain). Therefore, it is extremely difficult for current CS algorithms to recover EEG with the quality that satisfies the requirements of clinical diagnosis and engineering applications. Recently, Block Sparse Bayesian Learning (BSBL) was proposed as a new method to the CS problem. This study introduces the technique to the telemonitoring of EEG. Experimental results show that its recovery quality is better than state-of-the-art CS algorithms, and sufficient for practical use. These results suggest that BSBL is very promising for telemonitoring of EEG and other non-sparse physiological signals."

    "title": "Long-Term Vehicle Localization by Recursive Knowledge Distillation",
    "summary": "Most of the current state-of-the-art frameworks for cross-season visual place recognition (CS-VPR) focus on domain adaptation (DA) to a single specific season. From the viewpoint of long-term CS-VPR, such frameworks do not scale well to sequential multiple domains (e.g., spring - summer - autumn - winter - ... ). The goal of this study is to develop a novel long-term ensemble learning (LEL) framework that allows for a constant cost retraining in long-term sequential-multi-domain CS-VPR (SMD-VPR), which only requires the memorization of a small constant number of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and can retrain the CNN ensemble of every season at a small constant time/space cost. We frame our task as the multi-teacher multi-student knowledge distillation (MTMS-KD), which recursively compresses all the previous season's knowledge into a current CNN ensemble. We further address the issue of teacher-student-assignment (TSA) to achieve a good generalization/specialization tradeoff. Experimental results on SMD-VPR tasks validate the efficacy of the proposed approach."

    "title": "Non-Local Compressive Sensing Based SAR Tomography",
    "summary": "Tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) inversion of urban areas is an inherently sparse reconstruction problem and, hence, can be solved using compressive sensing (CS) algorithms. This paper proposes solutions for two notorious problems in this field: 1) TomoSAR requires a high number of data sets, which makes the technique expensive. However, it can be shown that the number of acquisitions and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be traded off against each other, because it is asymptotically only the product of the number of acquisitions and SNR that determines the reconstruction quality. We propose to increase SNR by integrating non-local estimation into the inversion and show that a reasonable reconstruction of buildings from only seven interferograms is feasible. 2) CS-based inversion is computationally expensive and therefore barely suitable for large-scale applications. We introduce a new fast and accurate algorithm for solving the non-local L1-L2-minimization problem, central to CS-based reconstruction algorithms. The applicability of the algorithm is demonstrated using simulated data and TerraSAR-X high-resolution spotlight images over an area in Munich, Germany."

During their studies, students cannot find the best career suggestions unless they receive meaningful guidance tailored to their skills. Therefore, we developed an AI-assisted model for early prediction to provide better career suggestions. Although the task is difficult, proper guidance can make it easier. Effective career guidance requires understanding a student's academic skills, interests, and skill-related activities. In this research, we collected essential information from Computer Science (CS) and Software Engineering (SWE) students to train a machine learning (ML) model that predicts career paths based on students' career-related information. To adequately train the models, we applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and completed dataset pre-processing. For comparative analysis, we utilized multiple classification ML algorithms and deep learning (DL) algorithms. This study contributes valuable insights to educational advising by providing specific career suggestions based on the unique features of CS and SWE students. Additionally, the research helps individual CS and SWE students find suitable jobs that match their skills, interests, and skill-related activities."

    "summary": "By integrating certain optimization solvers with deep neural networks, deep unfolding network (DUN) with good interpretability and high performance has attracted growing attention in compressive sensing (CS). However, existing DUNs often improve the visual quality at the price of a large number of parameters and have the problem of feature information loss during iteration. In this paper, we propose an Optimization-inspired Cross-attention Transformer (OCT) module as an iterative process, leading to a lightweight OCT-based Unfolding Framework (OCTUF) for image CS. Specifically, we design a novel Dual Cross Attention (Dual-CA) sub-module, which consists of an Inertia-Supplied Cross Attention (ISCA) block and a Projection-Guided Cross Attention (PGCA) block. ISCA block introduces multi-channel inertia forces and increases the memory effect by a cross attention mechanism between adjacent iterations. And, PGCA block achieves an enhanced information interaction, which introduces the inertia force into the gradient descent step through a cross attention block. Extensive CS experiments manifest that our OCTUF achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while training lower complexity.

    "summary": "Every day around the world, interminable terabytes of data are being captured for surveillance purposes. A typical 1-2MP CCTV camera generates around 7-12GB of data per day. Frame-by-frame processing of such enormous amount of data requires hefty computational resources. In recent years, compressive sensing approaches have shown impressive results in signal processing by reducing the sampling bandwidth. Different sampling mechanisms were developed to incorporate compressive sensing in image and video acquisition. Pixel-wise coded exposure is one among the promising sensing paradigms for capturing videos in the compressed domain, which was also realized into an all-CMOS sensor Xiong2017 . Though cameras that perform compressive sensing save a lot of bandwidth at the time of sampling and minimize the memory required to store videos, we cannot do much in terms of processing until the videos are reconstructed to the original frames. But, the reconstruction of compressive-sensed (CS) videos still takes a lot of time and is also computationally expensive. In this work, we show that object detection and localization can be possible directly on the CS frames (easily upto 20x compression). To our knowledge, this is the first time that the problem of object detection and localization on CS frames has been attempted. Hence, we also created a dataset for training in the CS domain. We were able to achieve a good accuracy of 46.27\\% mAP(Mean Average Precision) with the proposed model with an inference time of 23ms directly on the compressed frames(approx. 20 original domain frames), this facilitated for real-time inference which was verified on NVIDIA TX2 embedded board. Our framework will significantly reduce the communication bandwidth, and thus reduction in power as the video compression will be done at the image sensor processing core."

    "summary": "Modern-day cars are equipped with numerous cameras and sensors, typically integrated with advanced decision-control systems that enable the vehicle to perceive its surroundings and navigate autonomously. Efficient processing of data from sensors, lidars, radars and cameras is quite computationally intensive and can not be done with good accuracy using less capable onboard resources. In order to deal with this problem, some computation requirements (also referred as tasks) are offloaded to infrastructure or executed in parallel in both autonomous vehicle (AV) and infrastructure to enhance accuracy. The infrastructure comprises base stations, a centralized cloud, and a CS. Base stations (BSs) execute tasks in collaboration with a significantly more powerful centralized cloud, while the centralised scheduler (CS) centrally schedules all the tasks. The base station receives tasks from multiple AVs, each with varying deadlines, criticality, and locations. Our main goal is to maximize the profit of the infrastructure by (a) minimizing the number of drop tasks, (b) minimizing the distance cost for task offloading, and (c) minimizing the energy usage of BSs. In this work, we proposed efficient approaches to schedule the collection of tasks to the BSs, by employing a hybrid scheduling approach where tasks from AVs get allocated to nearby base stations if the nearby BSs are lightly loaded, otherwise AVs send the task to CS for allocation. The CS maximizes the profit by following strategies: (a) selection of BS considering distance and energy consumption, (b) when task load is moderate or low, highly critical tasks run at favourable utilisation, and (c) low-critical tasks are dropped to free up resources for executing high-critical tasks. Based on our experiments, proposed approaches improved the QoS provided by up to 25% compared to the state-of-the-art approach in real-life datasets."

We propose a novel sub-Nyquist sampling method in the Fourier domain based on difference sets (DS), called DS-sampling, to create dictionaries with highly incoherent atoms. The coherence of the dictionary reaches the Welch minimum bound if the DS-sampling is employed. This property let us to implement sub-Nyquist high resolution radars with minimum number of samples. We also develop a low complexity recovery method, based on structured CS and propose a new waveform, called difference set--frequency coded modulated (DS-FCM) waveform, to boost the recovery performance of the sub-Nyquist radar in noisy environments. The proposed method solves some of the common problems in many CS-based radars and overcome disadvantages of the conventional Nyquist processing, i.e. matched filtering in high resolution radar systems. The proposed method allows us to design sub-Nyquist radars, which require less than 2% of Nyquist samples and recover targets without resolution degradation in comparison to the conventional Nyquist processing."

    "title": "Compressed Sensing of Analog Signals in Shift-Invariant Spaces",
    "summary": "A traditional assumption underlying most data converters is that the signal should be sampled at a rate exceeding twice the highest frequency. This statement is based on a worst-case scenario in which the signal occupies the entire available bandwidth. In practice, many signals are sparse so that only part of the bandwidth is used. In this paper, we develop methods for low-rate sampling of continuous-time sparse signals in shift-invariant (SI) spaces, generated by m kernels with period T. We model sparsity by treating the case in which only k out of the m generators are active, however, we do not know which k are chosen. We show how to sample such signals at a rate much lower than m/T, which is the minimal sampling rate without exploiting sparsity. Our approach combines ideas from analog sampling in a subspace with a recently developed block diagram that converts an infinite set of sparse equations to a finite counterpart. Using these two components we formulate our problem within the framework of finite compressed sensing (CS) and then rely on algorithms developed in that context. The distinguishing feature of our results is that in contrast to standard CS, which treats finite-length vectors, we consider sampling of analog signals for which no underlying finite-dimensional model exists. The proposed framework allows to extend much of the recent literature on CS to the analog domain."

Therefore, effective and efficient debugging is one of the core skills a software engineer must develop. However, the teaching of debugging techniques is usually very limited or only taught in indirect ways, e.g., during software projects. As a result, most Computer Science (CS) students learn debugging only in an ad-hoc and unstructured way. In this work, we present our approach called Simulated Interactive Debugging that interactively guides students along the debugging process. The guidance aims to empower the students to repair their solutions and have a proper learning experience. We envision that such guided debugging techniques can be integrated into programming courses early in the CS education curriculum. We developed a prototypical implementation using traditional fault localization techniques and large language models. Students can use features like the automated setting of breakpoints or an interactive chatbot. We designed and executed a small-scale, controlled experiment with eight undergraduate CS students. Based on the responses, we conclude that the participants liked the systematic guidance. They rated the automated setting of breakpoints as most effective, followed by the interactive debugging and chatting, and the breakpoint explanations. In future, we will extend our concept and implementation, and perform more intensive user studies."

We observed WLM with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and as part of the MeerKAT Early Science Programme, where 16 dishes were available. The HI disc of WLM extends out to a major axis diameter of 30 arcmin (8.5 kpc), and a minor axis diameter of 20 arcmin (5.6 kpc) as measured by the GBT. We use the MeerKAT data to model WLM using the TiRiFiC software suite, allowing us to fit different tilted-ring models and select the one that best matches the observation. Our final best-fitting model is a flat disc with a vertical thickness, a constant inclination and dispersion, and a radially-varying surface brightness with harmonic distortions. To simulate bar-like motions, we include second-order harmonic distortions in velocity in the tangential and the vertical directions. We present a model with only circular motions included and a model with non-circular motions. The latter describes the data better. Overall, the models reproduce the global distribution and the kinematics of the gas, except for some faint emission at the 2-sigma level. We model the mass distribution of WLM with a pseudo-isothermal (ISO) and a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) dark matter halo models. The NFW and the ISO models fit the derived rotation curves within the formal errors, but with the ISO model giving better reduced chi-square values. The mass distribution in WLM is dominated by dark matter at all radii."

Firstly, we unfold the model-based CS-MRI optimization problem into two sub-problems that consist of image linear approximation and image geometric compensation. Secondly, geometric compensation sub-problem for distilling lost texture details in approximation stage can be expanded by Taylor expansion to design a geometric distillation module fusing features of different geometric characteristic domains. Additionally, we use a learnable version with adaptive initialization of the step-length parameter, which allows model more flexibility that can lead to convergent smoothly.

One example of such matrices are the randomly selected discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrices. Such selection enjoys a less memory complexity and a faster multiplication procedure. Our contributions are the replica calculations to find the mean-square-error (MSE) of the Bayes-optimal reconstruction for such setup. We illustrate that the reconstruction thresholds under the spatially-coupled orthogonal and Gaussian ensembles are quite different especially in the noisy cases. In particular, the spatially coupled orthogonal matrices achieve the faster convergence rate, the lower measurement rate, and the reduced MSE."

Further, through qualitative experiments on real data collected using our block single pixel camera (SPC), we show that our network is highly robust to sensor noise and can recover visually better quality images than competitive algorithms at extremely low sensing rates of 0.1 and 0.04. To demonstrate that our algorithm can recover semantically informative images even at a low measurement rate of 0.01, we present a very robust proof of concept real-time visual tracking application."

    "summary": "Compressed Sensing MRI (CS-MRI) has provided theoretical foundations upon which the time-consuming MRI acquisition process can be accelerated. However, it primarily relies on iterative numerical solvers which still hinders their adaptation in time-critical applications. In addition, recent advances in deep neural networks have shown their potential in computer vision and image processing, but their adaptation to MRI reconstruction is still in an early stage. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based generative adversarial model, RefineGAN, for fast and accurate CS-MRI reconstruction. The proposed model is a variant of fully-residual convolutional autoencoder and generative adversarial networks (GANs), specifically designed for CS-MRI formulation; it employs deeper generator and discriminator networks with cyclic data consistency loss for faithful interpolation in the given under-sampled k-space data. In addition, our solution leverages a chained network to further enhance the reconstruction quality. RefineGAN is fast and accurate -- the reconstruction process is extremely rapid, as low as tens of milliseconds for reconstruction of a 256x256 image, because it is one-way deployment on a feed-forward network, and the image quality is superior even for extremely low sampling rate (as low as 10%) due to the data-driven nature of the method. We demonstrate that RefineGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art CS-MRI methods by a large margin in terms of both running time and image quality via evaluation using several open-source MRI databases."

Polynomial phase signals are not sparse in commonly used domains such as Fourier or wavelet domain. Therefore, for polynomial phase signals standard CS algorithms applied in these transformation domains cannot provide satisfactory results. In that sense, the Polynomial Fourier transform is used to ensure sparsity. The proposed approach is generalized using time-frequency representations obtained by the Local Polynomial Fourier transform (LPFT).

The physics of water flow suggests that water surfaces possess spatio-temporal smoothness and temporal periodicity. Hence they possess a sparse representation in the 3D discrete Fourier (DFT) basis. Motivated by this, we pose the task of restoration of such video sequences as a compressed sensing (CS) problem. We begin by tracking a few salient feature points across the frames of a video sequence of the submerged scene. Using these point trajectories, we show that the motion fields at all other (non-tracked) points can be effectively estimated using a typical CS solver. This by itself is a novel contribution in the field of non-rigid motion estimation. We show that this method outperforms state of the art algorithms for underwater image restoration. We further consider a simple optical flow algorithm based on local polynomial expansion of the image frames (PEOF). Surprisingly, we demonstrate that PEOF is more efficient and often outperforms all the state of the art methods in terms of numerical measures. Finally, we demonstrate that a two-stage approach consisting of the CS step followed by PEOF much more accurately preserves the image structure and improves the (visual as well as numerical) video quality as compared to just the PEOF stage."

    "summary": "High signal to noise ratio (SNR) consistency of model selection criteria in linear regression models has attracted a lot of attention recently. However, most of the existing literature on high SNR consistency deals with model order selection. Further, the limited literature available on the high SNR consistency of subset selection procedures (SSPs) is applicable to linear regression with full rank measurement matrices only. Hence, the performance of SSPs used in underdetermined linear models (a.k.a compressive sensing (CS) algorithms) at high SNR is largely unknown. This paper fills this gap by deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for the high SNR consistency of popular CS algorithms like -minimization, basis pursuit de-noising or LASSO, orthogonal matching pursuit and Dantzig selector. Necessary conditions analytically establish the high SNR inconsistency of CS algorithms when used with the tuning parameters discussed in literature. Novel tuning parameters with SNR adaptations are developed using the sufficient conditions and the choice of SNR adaptations are discussed analytically using convergence rate analysis. CS algorithms with the proposed tuning parameters are numerically shown to be high SNR consistent and outperform existing tuning parameters in the moderate to high SNR regime."

    "summary": "We present specialized Large Language Models for theoretical High-Energy Physics, obtained as 20 fine-tuned variants of the 8-billion parameter Llama-3.1 model. Each variant was trained on arXiv abstracts (through August 2024) from different combinations of hep-th, hep-ph and gr-qc. For a comparative study, we also trained models on datasets that contained abstracts from disparate fields such as the q-bio and cs categories. All models were fine-tuned using two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning approaches and varying dataset sizes, and outperformed the base model on hep-th abstract completion tasks. We compare performance against leading commercial LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek) and derive insights for further developing specialized language models for High-Energy Theoretical Physics."

    "title": "Modelling local and global phenomena with sparse Gaussian processes",
    "summary": "Much recent work has concerned sparse approximations to speed up the Gaussian process regression from the unfavorable O(n3) scaling in computational time to O(nm2). Thus far, work has concentrated on models with one covariance function. However, in many practical situations additive models with multiple covariance functions may perform better, since the data may contain both long and short length-scale phenomena. The long length-scales can be captured with global sparse approximations, such as fully independent conditional (FIC), and the short length-scales can be modeled naturally by covariance functions with compact support (CS). CS covariance functions lead to naturally sparse covariance matrices, which are computationally cheaper to handle than full covariance matrices. In this paper, we propose a new sparse Gaussian process model with two additive components: FIC for the long length-scales and CS covariance function for the short length-scales. We give theoretical and experimental results and show that under certain conditions the proposed model has the same computational complexity as FIC. We also compare the model performance of the proposed model to additive models approximated by fully and partially independent conditional (PIC). We use real data sets and show that our model outperforms FIC and PIC approximations for data sets with two additive phenomena."

    "summary": "We present CrossLoc3D, a novel 3D place recognition method that solves a large-scale point matching problem in a cross-source setting. Cross-source point cloud data corresponds to point sets captured by depth sensors with different accuracies or from different distances and perspectives. We address the challenges in terms of developing 3D place recognition methods that account for the representation gap between points captured by different sources. Our method handles cross-source data by utilizing multi-grained features and selecting convolution kernel sizes that correspond to most prominent features. Inspired by the diffusion models, our method uses a novel iterative refinement process that gradually shifts the embedding spaces from different sources to a single canonical space for better metric learning. In addition, we present CS-Campus3D, the first 3D aerial-ground cross-source dataset consisting of point cloud data from both aerial and ground LiDAR scans. The point clouds in CS-Campus3D have representation gaps and other features like different views, point densities, and noise patterns. We show that our CrossLoc3D algorithm can achieve an improvement of 4.74% - 15.37% in terms of the top 1 average recall on our CS-Campus3D benchmark and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art 3D place recognition method on the Oxford RobotCar. The code and CS-CAMPUS3D benchmark will be available at github.com/rayguan97/crossloc3d."

    "summary": "Objective To develop an LLM based realtime compound diagnostic medical AI interface and performed a clinical trial comparing this interface and physicians for common internal medicine cases based on the United States Medical License Exam (USMLE) Step 2 Clinical Skill (CS) style exams. Methods A nonrandomized clinical trial was conducted on August 20, 2024. We recruited one general physician, two internal medicine residents (2nd and 3rd year), and five simulated patients. The clinical vignettes were adapted from the USMLE Step 2 CS style exams. We developed 10 representative internal medicine cases based on actual patients and included information available on initial diagnostic evaluation. Primary outcome was the accuracy of the first differential diagnosis. Repeatability was evaluated based on the proportion of agreement. Results The accuracy of the physicians' first differential diagnosis ranged from 50% to 70%, whereas the realtime compound diagnostic medical AI interface achieved an accuracy of 80%. The proportion of agreement for the first differential diagnosis was 0.7. The accuracy of the first and second differential diagnoses ranged from 70% to 90% for physicians, whereas the AI interface achieved an accuracy rate of 100%. The average time for the AI interface (557 sec) was 44.6% shorter than that of the physicians (1006 sec). The AI interface ( 4.2). Patient satisfaction scores ranged from 4.2 to 4.3 for care by physicians and were 3.9 for the AI interface Conclusion An LLM based realtime compound diagnostic medical AI interface demonstrated diagnostic accuracy and patient satisfaction comparable to those of a physician, while requiring less time and lower costs. These findings suggest that AI interfaces may have the potential to assist primary care consultations for common internal medicine cases."

    "summary": "Next generation wireless networks will exploit the large amount of spectrum available at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies. Design of mmWave systems, however, is challenging due to strict power, cost and hardware constraints at higher bandwidths. To achieve a good SNR for communication, mmWave systems use large antenna arrays. Beamforming with highly directional beams is one way to use the antennas. As the channel changes over time, the beams that maximize the SNR have to be estimated quickly to reduce the training overhead. Prior work has exploited the observation that mmWave channels are sparse to perform compressed sensing (CS) based beam alignment with few channel measurements. Most of the existing CS-based algorithms, however, assume perfect synchronization and fail in the presence of carrier frequency offset (CFO). This paper presents Swift-Link, a fast beam alignment algorithm that is robust against the offset. Swift-Link includes a novel randomized beam training sequence that minimizes the beam alignment errors due to CFO and a low-complexity algorithm that corrects these errors. Even with strict hardware constraints, our algorithm uses fewer channel measurements than comparable CS algorithms and has analytical guarantees. Swift-Link requires a small output dynamic range at the analog-to-digital converter compared to beam-scanning techniques."

    "title": "From Automation to Cognition: Redefining the Roles of Educators and Generative AI in Computing Education",
    "summary": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) offers numerous opportunities to revolutionise teaching and learning in Computing Education (CE). However, educators have expressed concerns that students may over-rely on GenAI and use these tools to generate solutions without engaging in the learning process. While substantial research has explored GenAI use in CE, and many Computer Science (CS) educators have expressed their opinions and suggestions on the subject, there remains little consensus on implementing curricula and assessment changes. In this paper, we describe our experiences with using GenAI in CS-focused educational settings and the changes we have implemented accordingly in our teaching in recent years since the popularisation of GenAI. From our experiences, we propose two primary actions for the CE community: 1) redesign take-home assignments to incorporate GenAI use and assess students on their process of using GenAI to solve a task rather than simply on the final product; 2) redefine the role of educators to emphasise metacognitive aspects of learning, such as critical thinking and self-evaluation. This paper presents and discusses these stances and outlines several practical methods to implement these strategies in CS classrooms. Then, we advocate for more research addressing the concrete impacts of GenAI on CE, especially those evaluating the validity and effectiveness of new teaching practices."

Our findings demonstrate that: (1) LoRA-based methods effectively improve task-specific performance while maintaining computational efficiency, and (2) performance strongly depends on alignment between fine-tuning dataset and benchmark tasks.

While that risk has already been recognized by scholars, the proportion of the student body that is incurring in this new kind of plagiarism is still an open problem. We conducted a pilot study in a large CS class (n=120) to assess the feasibility of estimating AI plagiarism through anonymous surveys and interviews. More than 25% of the survey respondents admitted to committing AI plagiarism. Conversely, only one student accepted to be interviewed. Given the high levels of misconduct acknowledgment, we conclude that surveys are an effective method for studies on the matter, while interviews should be avoided or designed in a way that can entice participation."

    "title": "Sub-Nyquist Radar via Doppler Focusing",
    "summary": "We investigate the problem of a monostatic pulse-Doppler radar transceiver trying to detect targets, sparsely populated in the radar's unambiguous time-frequency region. Several past works employ compressed sensing (CS) algorithms to this type of problem, but either do not address sample rate reduction, impose constraints on the radar transmitter, propose CS recovery methods with prohibitive dictionary size, or perform poorly in noisy conditions. Here we describe a sub-Nyquist sampling and recovery approach called Doppler focusing which addresses all of these problems: it performs low rate sampling and digital processing, imposes no restrictions on the transmitter, and uses a CS dictionary with size which does not increase with increasing number of pulses P. Furthermore, in the presence of noise, Doppler focusing enjoys an SNR increase which scales linearly with P, obtaining good detection performance even at SNRs as low as -25dB. The recovery is based on the Xampling framework, which allows reducing the number of samples needed to accurately represent the signal, directly in the analog-to-digital conversion process. After sampling, the entire digital recovery process is performed on the low rate samples without having to return to the Nyquist rate. Finally, our approach can be implemented in hardware using a previously suggested Xampling prototype."

In particular, we examine asymptotic approximations for the marginal likelihood of incomplete data given a Bayesian network. We consider the Laplace approximation and the less accurate but more efficient BIC/MDL approximation. We also consider approximations proposed by Draper (1993) and Cheeseman and Stutz (1995). These approximations are as efficient as BIC/MDL, but their accuracy has not been studied in any depth. We compare the accuracy of these approximations under the assumption that the Laplace approximation is the most accurate. In experiments using synthetic data generated from discrete naive-Bayes models having a hidden root node, we find that the CS measure is the most accurate."

    "title": "Signal Space CoSaMP for Sparse Recovery with Redundant Dictionaries",
    "summary": "Compressive sensing (CS) has recently emerged as a powerful framework for acquiring sparse signals. The bulk of the CS literature has focused on the case where the acquired signal has a sparse or compressible representation in an orthonormal basis. In practice, however, there are many signals that cannot be sparsely represented or approximated using an orthonormal basis, but that do have sparse representations in a redundant dictionary. Standard results in CS can sometimes be extended to handle this case provided that the dictionary is sufficiently incoherent or well-conditioned, but these approaches fail to address the case of a truly redundant or overcomplete dictionary. In this paper we describe a variant of the iterative recovery algorithm CoSaMP for this more challenging setting. We utilize the D-RIP, a condition on the sensing matrix analogous to the well-known restricted isometry property. In contrast to prior work, the method and analysis are \"signal-focused\"; that is, they are oriented around recovering the signal rather than its dictionary coefficients. Under the assumption that we have a near-optimal scheme for projecting vectors in signal space onto the model family of candidate sparse signals, we provide provable recovery guarantees. Developing a practical algorithm that can provably compute the required near-optimal projections remains a significant open problem, but we include simulation results using various heuristics that empirically exhibit superior performance to traditional recovery algorithms."

    "title": "1-Bit Compressive Sensing for Efficient Federated Learning Over the Air",
    "summary": "For distributed learning among collaborative users, this paper develops and analyzes a communication-efficient scheme for federated learning (FL) over the air, which incorporates 1-bit compressive sensing (CS) into analog aggregation transmissions. To facilitate design parameter optimization, we theoretically analyze the efficacy of the proposed scheme by deriving a closed-form expression for the expected convergence rate of the FL over the air. Our theoretical results reveal the tradeoff between convergence performance and communication efficiency as a result of the aggregation errors caused by sparsification, dimension reduction, quantization, signal reconstruction and noise. Then, we formulate 1-bit CS based FL over the air as a joint optimization problem to mitigate the impact of these aggregation errors through joint optimal design of worker scheduling and power scaling policy. An enumeration-based method is proposed to solve this non-convex problem, which is optimal but becomes computationally infeasible as the number of devices increases. For scalable computing, we resort to the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) technique to develop an efficient implementation that is suitable for large-scale networks. Simulation results show that our proposed 1-bit CS based FL over the air achieves comparable performance to the ideal case where conventional FL without compression and quantification is applied over error-free aggregation, at much reduced communication overhead and transmission latency."

To set the stage for this union, we explore two different flavors of model space problems that have been studied in the AI planning literature and explore the effect of an LLM on those tasks. We empirically demonstrate how the performance of an LLM contrasts with combinatorial search (CS) -- an approach that has been traditionally used to solve model space tasks in planning, both with the LLM in the role of a standalone model space reasoner as well as in the role of a statistical signal in concert with the CS approach as part of a two-stage process. Our experiments show promising results suggesting further forays of LLMs into the exciting world of model space reasoning for planning tasks in the future."

In a user study, our system outperformed a commercial computational mathematical knowledge engine by 13%. However, the performance of our system heavily depends on the size and quality of the formula data available in Wikidata.

However, most of the literature highlights the effects of pair programming in introductory courses, where students have varied levels of prior programming experience and thus may experience related group issues. This work analyzes the effect of pair programming in an upper-level computer science course, where students have a more consistent background education, particularly in languages learned and best practices in coding. Secondly, the effect of remote pair programming on student outcomes is still an open question and one of increasing importance with the advent of Covid-19. This work utilized split sections with a control and treatment group in a large, public university. In addition to comparing pair programming to individual programming, results were analyzed by modality (remote vs. in person) and by gender, focusing on how pair programming benefits female computer science students in confidence, persistence in the major, and outcomes. We found that pair programming groups scored higher on assignments and exams, that remote pair programming groups performed as well as in person groups, and that female students increased their confidence in asking questions in class and scored 12\\% higher in the course when utilizing pair programming."

    "title": "Compressive Sensing for Spread Spectrum Receivers",
    "summary": "With the advent of ubiquitous computing there are two design parameters of wireless communication devices that become very important power: efficiency and production cost. Compressive sensing enables the receiver in such devices to sample below the Shannon-Nyquist sampling rate, which may lead to a decrease in the two design parameters. This paper investigates the use of Compressive Sensing (CS) in a general Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) receiver. We show that when using spread spectrum codes in the signal domain, the CS measurement matrix may be simplified. This measurement scheme, named Compressive Spread Spectrum (CSS), allows for a simple, effective receiver design. Furthermore, we numerically evaluate the proposed receiver in terms of bit error rate under different signal to noise ratio conditions and compare it with other receiver structures. These numerical experiments show that though the bit error rate performance is degraded by the subsampling in the CS-enabled receivers, this may be remedied by including quantization in the receiver model. We also study the computational complexity of the proposed receiver design under different sparsity and measurement ratios. Our work shows that it is possible to subsample a CDMA signal using CSS and that in one example the CSS receiver outperforms the classical receiver."

    "summary": "Gaussian processes (GP) are attractive building blocks for many probabilistic models. Their drawbacks, however, are the rapidly increasing inference time and memory requirement alongside increasing data. The problem can be alleviated with compactly supported (CS) covariance functions, which produce sparse covariance matrices that are fast in computations and cheap to store. CS functions have previously been used in GP regression but here the focus is in a classification problem. This brings new challenges since the posterior inference has to be done approximately. We utilize the expectation propagation algorithm and show how its standard implementation has to be modified to obtain computational benefits from the sparse covariance matrices. We study four CS covariance functions and show that they may lead to substantial speed up in the inference time compared to globally supported functions."

    "summary": "By integrating certain optimization solvers with deep neural network, deep unfolding network (DUN) has attracted much attention in recent years for image compressed sensing (CS). However, there still exist several issues in existing DUNs: 1) For each iteration, a simple stacked convolutional network is usually adopted, which apparently limits the expressiveness of these models. 2) Once the training is completed, most hyperparameters of existing DUNs are fixed for any input content, which significantly weakens their adaptability. In this paper, by unfolding the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA), a novel fast hierarchical DUN, dubbed FHDUN, is proposed for image compressed sensing, in which a well-designed hierarchical unfolding architecture is developed to cooperatively explore richer contextual prior information in multi-scale spaces. To further enhance the adaptability, series of hyperparametric generation networks are developed in our framework to dynamically produce the corresponding optimal hyperparameters according to the input content. Furthermore, due to the accelerated policy in FISTA, the newly embedded acceleration module makes the proposed FHDUN save more than 50% of the iterative loops against recent DUNs. Extensive CS experiments manifest that the proposed FHDUN outperforms existing state-of-the-art CS methods, while maintaining fewer iterations."

Our signals are assumed to be stationary and ergodic, but the input statistics are unknown; the goal is to provide reconstruction algorithms that are universal to the input statistics. We present a novel algorithm that combines: (i) the approximate message passing (AMP) CS reconstruction framework, which converts the matrix channel recovery problem into scalar channel denoising; (ii) a universal denoising scheme based on context quantization, which partitions the stationary ergodic signal denoising into independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) subsequence denoising; and (iii) a density estimation approach that approximates the probability distribution of an i.i.d. sequence by fitting a Gaussian mixture (GM) model. In addition to the algorithmic framework, we provide three contributions: (i) numerical results showing that state evolution holds for non-separable Bayesian sliding-window denoisers; (ii) a universal denoiser that does not require the input signal to be bounded; and (iii) we modify the GM learning algorithm, and extend it to an i.i.d. denoiser. Our universal CS recovery algorithm compares favorably with existing reconstruction algorithms in terms of both reconstruction quality and runtime, despite not knowing the input statistics of the stationary ergodic signal."

Despite this population of computer scientists being at the forefront of learning about and using AI tools, their attitudes towards AI remain understudied in the literature. In an effort to begin to close this gap, in fall 2024 we fielded a survey ( ) to undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in CS courses at a large public university in the United States to assess their attitudes towards the nascent fields of AI ethics and policy. Additionally, we conducted one-on-one follow-up interviews with 13 students to elicit more in-depth responses on topics such as the use of AI tools in the classroom, ethical impacts of AI, and government regulation of AI. In this paper, we describe the findings of both the survey and interviews, drawing parallels and contrasts to broader public opinion polling in the United States.

    "title": "A Variable Density Sampling Scheme for Compressive Fourier Transform Interferometry",
    "summary": "Fourier Transform Interferometry (FTI) is an appealing Hyperspectral (HS) imaging modality for many applications demanding high spectral resolution, e.g., in fluorescence microscopy. However, the effective resolution of FTI is limited by the durability of biological elements when exposed to illuminating light. Overexposed elements are subject to photo-bleaching and become unable to fluoresce. In this context, the acquisition of biological HS volumes based on sampling the Optical Path Difference (OPD) axis at Nyquist rate leads to unpleasant trade-offs between spectral resolution, quality of the HS volume, and light exposure intensity. We propose two variants of the FTI imager, i.e., Coded Illumination-FTI (CI-FTI) and Structured Illumination FTI (SI-FTI), based on the theory of compressive sensing (CS). These schemes efficiently modulate light exposure temporally (in CI-FTI) or spatiotemporally (in SI-FTI). Leveraging a variable density sampling strategy recently introduced in CS, we provide near-optimal illumination strategies, so that the light exposure imposed on a biological specimen is minimized while the spectral resolution is preserved. Our analysis focuses on two criteria: (i) a trade-off between exposure intensity and the quality of the reconstructed HS volume for a given spectral resolution; (ii) maximizing HS volume quality for a fixed spectral resolution and constrained exposure budget. Our contributions can be adapted to an FTI imager without hardware modifications. The reconstruction of HS volumes from CS-FTI measurements relies on an -norm minimization problem promoting a spatiospectral sparsity prior. Numerically, we support the proposed methods on synthetic data and simulated CS measurements (from actual FTI measurements) under various scenarios. In particular, the biological HS volumes can be reconstructed with a three-to-ten-fold reduction in the light exposure."

While most prior works assume uniform and unbiased client selection, recent work on biased client selection has shown that selecting clients with higher local losses can improve error convergence speed. However, previously proposed biased selection strategies either require additional communication cost for evaluating the exact local loss or utilize stale local loss, which can even make the model diverge. In this paper, we present a bandit-based communication-efficient client selection strategy UCB-CS that achieves faster convergence with lower communication overhead. We also demonstrate how client selection can be used to improve fairness."

However, the popularity of this approach has outpaced the evidence of its positive outcomes. To help close that gap, this empirical study reports positive results from Northeastern's program that embeds values analysis modules into CS courses. The resulting data suggest that such modules have a positive effect on students' moral attitudes and that students leave the modules believing they are more prepared to navigate the ethical dimensions they will likely face in their eventual careers. Importantly, these gains were accomplished at an institution without a philosophy doctoral program, suggesting this strategy can be effectively employed by a wider range of institutions than many have thought."

Our latest shadow path prediction was favourable to a large region in Europe. Observations were arranged in a broad region inside the nominal shadow path. Series of images were obtained with 29 telescopes throughout Europe and from six of them (five in Spain and one in Greece) we detected the occultation. This is the fourth centaur, besides Chariklo, Chiron and Bienor, for which a multi-chord stellar occultation is reported. By means of an elliptical fit to the occultation chords we obtained the limb of 2002 GZ during the occultation, resulting in an ellipse with axes of 305 17 km 146 8 km. From this limb, thanks to a rotational light curve obtained shortly after the occultation, we derived the geometric albedo of 2002 GZ ( = 0.043 0.007) and a 3-D ellipsoidal shape with axes 366 km 306 km 120 km. This shape is not fully consistent with a homogeneous body in hydrostatic equilibrium for the known rotation period of 2002 GZ . The size (albedo) obtained from the occultation is respectively smaller (greater) than that derived from the radiometric technique but compatible within error bars. No rings or debris around 2002 GZ were detected from the occultation, but narrow and thin rings cannot be discarded."

The state of the art for automated anomaly detection in these systems typically relies on expert knowledge and thresholds. However, data is viewed isolated and complex, multivariate relationships are neglected. In this work, we present an autoencoder based end-to-end workflow for anomaly detection suitable for multivariate time series data in large industrial cooling systems, including explained fault localization and root cause analysis based on expert knowledge. We identify system failures using a threshold on the total reconstruction error (autoencoder reconstruction error including all sensor signals). For fault localization, we compute the individual reconstruction error (autoencoder reconstruction error for each sensor signal) allowing us to identify the signals that contribute most to the total reconstruction error. Expert knowledge is provided via look-up table enabling root-cause analysis and assignment to the affected subsystem. We demonstrated our findings in a cooling system unit including 34 sensors over a 8-months time period using 4-fold cross validation approaches and automatically created labels based on thresholds provided by domain experts. Using 4-fold cross validation, we reached a F1-score of 0.56, whereas the autoencoder results showed a higher consistency score (CS of 0.92) compared to the automatically created labels (CS of 0.62) -- indicating that the anomaly is recognized in a very stable manner. The main anomaly was found by the autoencoder and automatically created labels and was also recorded in the log files. Further, the explained fault localization highlighted the most affected component for the main anomaly in a very consistent manner."

We propose an alternative approach by adopting the latest advances in matrix completion algorithms to demonstrate the sparse sensing of weather echoes. We use Iowa X-band Polarimetric (XPOL) radar data to test and illustrate our algorithms."

    "summary": "This paper presents a comparative study on millimeter wave (mmWave) location-based analog beamforming (BF) techniques based on channel estimation. Localization and compressive sensing (CS) effectively reduces mmWave BF complexity and enhance the performance of mmWave system comparable to the conventional mmWave analog BF techniques. BF techniques based on channel state information (CSI) has high complexity in constructing mmWave channel sensing matrix using CS. Location services based techniques highly reduce this complexity by defining the area within which the user equipment (UE) mostly probable to be exist. In this paper, we study the performance of mmWave location-based BF using various location services. Where, the BF is conducted using channel estimation based CS to estimate both the angle of departures (AoDs) and the angle of arrivals (AoAs) of the mmWave channel."

    "summary": "To more efficiently address image compressed sensing (CS) problems, we present a novel content-aware scalable network dubbed CASNet which collectively achieves adaptive sampling rate allocation, fine granular scalability and high-quality reconstruction. We first adopt a data-driven saliency detector to evaluate the importances of different image regions and propose a saliency-based block ratio aggregation (BRA) strategy for sampling rate allocation. A unified learnable generating matrix is then developed to produce sampling matrix of any CS ratio with an ordered structure. Being equipped with the optimization-inspired recovery subnet guided by saliency information and a multi-block training scheme preventing blocking artifacts, CASNet jointly reconstructs the image blocks sampled at various sampling rates with one single model. To accelerate training convergence and improve network robustness, we propose an SVD-based initialization scheme and a random transformation enhancement (RTE) strategy, which are extensible without introducing extra parameters. All the CASNet components can be combined and learned end-to-end. We further provide a four-stage implementation for evaluation and practical deployments. Experiments demonstrate that CASNet outperforms other CS networks by a large margin, validating the collaboration and mutual supports among its components and strategies. Codes are available at https://github.com/Guaishou74851/CASNet."

    "summary": "We consider a multi-hop wireless sensor network that measures sparse events and propose a simple forwarding protocol based on Compressed Sensing (CS) which does not need any sophisticated Media Access Control (MAC) scheduling, neither a routing protocol, thereby making significant overhead and energy savings. By means of flooding, multiple packets with different superimposed measurements are received simultaneously at any node. Thanks to our protocol, each node is able to recover each measurement and forward it while avoiding cycles. Numerical results show that our protocol achieves close to zero reconstruction errors at the sink, while greatly reducing overhead. This initial research reveals a new and promising approach to protocol design through CS for wireless mesh and sensor networks."

    "summary": "The multi-panel array, as a state-of-the-art antenna-in-package technology, is very suitable for millimeter-wave (mmWave)/terahertz (THz) systems, due to its low-cost deployment and scalable configuration. But in the context of nonuniform array structures it leads to intractable signal processing. Based on such an array structure at the base station, this paper investigates a joint active user detection (AUD) and channel estimation (CE) scheme based on compressive sensing (CS) for application to the massive Internet of Things (IoT). Specifically, by exploiting the structured sparsity of mmWave/THz massive IoT access channels, we firstly formulate the multi-panel massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO)-based joint AUD and CE problem as a multiple measurement vector (MMV)-CS problem. Then, we harness the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to learn the prior parameters (i.e., the noise variance and the sparsity ratio) and an orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP)-EM-MMV algorithm is developed to solve this problem. Our simulation results verify the improved AUD and CE performance of the proposed scheme compared to conventional CS-based algorithms."

While compressive sensing (CS) has been used to identify strong signals (or interferers) in the RF spectrum from sub-Nyquist measurements, identifying unused frequencies from CS measurements appears to be uncharted territory. In this paper, we propose a novel method for identifying unused RF bands using an algorithm we call least matching pursuit (LMP). We present a sufficient condition for which LMP is guaranteed to identify unused frequency bands and develop an improved algorithm that is inspired by our theoretical result. We perform simulations for a CS-based RF whitespace detection task in order to demonstrate that LMP is able to outperform black-box approaches that build on deep neural networks."

An analytical solution for the corresponding sensing matrix is derived which leads to low computational complexity. We also exploit this prior information through the sparse recovery stage and propose a probability-driven orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm that improves the accuracy of the recovery. Simulations for synthetic data and application scenarios of surveillance video are carried out to compare the performance of the proposed methods with some existing algorithms.

    "summary": "PURPOSE: Real-time assessment of ventricular volumes requires high acceleration factors. Residual convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown potential for removing artifacts caused by data undersampling. In this study we investigated the effect of different radial sampling patterns on the accuracy of a CNN. We also acquired actual real-time undersampled radial data in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), and compare CNN reconstruction to Compressed Sensing (CS). METHODS: A 3D (2D plus time) CNN architecture was developed, and trained using 2276 gold-standard paired 3D data sets, with 14x radial undersampling. Four sampling schemes were tested, using 169 previously unseen 3D 'synthetic' test data sets. Actual real-time tiny Golden Angle (tGA) radial SSFP data was acquired in 10 new patients (122 3D data sets), and reconstructed using the 3D CNN as well as a CS algorithm; GRASP. RESULTS: Sampling pattern was shown to be important for image quality, and accurate visualisation of cardiac structures. For actual real-time data, overall reconstruction time with CNN (including creation of aliased images) was shown to be more than 5x faster than GRASP. Additionally, CNN image quality and accuracy of biventricular volumes was observed to be superior to GRASP for the same raw data. CONCLUSION: This paper has demonstrated the potential for the use of a 3D CNN for deep de-aliasing of real-time radial data, within the clinical setting. Clinical measures of ventricular volumes using real-time data with CNN reconstruction are not statistically significantly different from the gold-standard, cardiac gated, BH techniques."

To construct the secret matrix and renew it at each encryption, a bipolar keystream and a random permutation pattern are employed as cryptographic primitives, which can be obtained by a keystream generator of stream ciphers. With a small number of nonzero elements in the measurement matrix, the S-OTS cryptosystem achieves efficient CS encryption in terms of memory and computational cost. In security analysis, we show that the S-OTS cryptosystem can be indistinguishable as long as each plaintext has constant energy, which formalizes computational security against ciphertext only attacks (COA). In addition, we consider a chosen plaintext attack (CPA) against the S-OTS cryptosystem, which consists of two sequential stages, keystream and key recovery attacks. Against keystream recovery under CPA, we demonstrate that the S-OTS cryptosystem can be secure with overwhelmingly high probability, as an adversary needs to distinguish a prohibitively large number of candidate keystreams. Finally, we conduct an information-theoretic analysis to show that the S-OTS cryptosystem can be resistant against key recovery under CPA by guaranteeing that the probability of success is extremely low. In conclusion, the S-OTS cryptosystem can be computationally secure against COA and the two-stage CPA, while providing efficiency in CS encryption."

    "title": "An algorithm for variable density sampling with block-constrained acquisition",
    "summary": "Reducing acquisition time is of fundamental importance in various imaging modalities. The concept of variable density sampling provides a nice framework to achieve this. It was justified recently from a theoretical point of view in the compressed sensing (CS) literature. Unfortunately, the sampling schemes suggested by current CS theories may not be relevant since they do not take the acquisition constraints into account (for example, continuity of the acquisition trajectory in Magnetic Resonance Imaging - MRI). In this paper, we propose a numerical method to perform variable density sampling with block constraints. Our main contribution is to propose a new way to draw the blocks in order to mimic CS strategies based on isolated measurements. The basic idea is to minimize a tailored dissimilarity measure between a probability distribution defined on the set of isolated measurements and a probability distribution defined on a set of blocks of measurements. This problem turns out to be convex and solvable in high dimension. Our second contribution is to define an efficient minimization algorithm based on Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent in metric spaces. We study carefully the choice of the metrics and of the prox function. We show that the optimal choice may depend on the type of blocks under consideration. Finally, we show that we can obtain better MRI reconstruction results using our sampling schemes than standard strategies such as equiangularly distributed radial lines."

    "summary": "The cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is a promising network architecture for future mobile communications, and one practical hurdle for its large scale implementation is the stringent requirement of high capacity and low latency fronthaul connecting the distributed remote radio heads (RRH) to the centralized baseband pools (BBUs) in the C-RAN. To improve the scalability of C-RAN networks, it is very important to take the fronthaul loading into consideration in the signal detection, and it is very desirable to reduce the fronthaul loading in C-RAN systems. In this paper, we consider uplink C-RAN systems and we propose a distributed fronthaul compression scheme at the distributed RRHs and a joint recovery algorithm at the BBUs by deploying the techniques of distributed compressive sensing (CS). Different from conventional distributed CS, the CS problem in C-RAN system needs to incorporate the underlying effect of multi-access fading for the end-to-end recovery of the transmitted signals from the users. We analyze the performance of the proposed end-to-end signal recovery algorithm and we show that the aggregate measurement matrix in C-RAN systems, which contains both the distributed fronthaul compression and multiaccess fading, can still satisfy the restricted isometry property with high probability. Based on these results, we derive tradeoff results between the uplink capacity and the fronthaul loading in C-RAN systems."

Due to limited spectrum resources, TN and NTN may soon share the same spectrum. Therefore, fine-grained spectrum monitoring is crucial for spectrum sharing and interference avoidance. To this end, constructing a 4D radio map (RM) including three spatial dimensions and signal spectra is important. However, this requires the large deployment of sensors, and high-speed analog-to-digital converters for extensive spatial signal collection and wide power spectrum acquisition, respectively. To address these challenges, we propose a deep unsupervised learning framework without ground truths labeling requirement, DeepRM, comprised of neural compressive sensing (CS) and tensor decomposition (TD) algorithms. Firstly, we map the CS process into the optimization of a neural networksassociated loss function, and design a sparsity-performance balance training algorithm to reconstruct a wide power spectrum under limited sub-Nquist samples. Secondly, according to the output of neural CS algorithm, we also utilize neural networks to perform TD, and construct the 3D RM for each frequency, even under very sparse sensor deployment. Extensive evaluations show that DeepRM achieves lower error than its corresponding state-of-the-art baselines, especially with limited samples."

In this letter, we propose a block iterative support detection (block-ISD) based algorithm for downlink channel estimation to reduce the pilot overhead, which is achieved by fully exploiting the block sparsity inherent in the block-sparse equivalent channel derived from the spatial correlations of MIMO channels. Furthermore, unlike conventional compressive sensing (CS) algorithms that rely on prior knowledge of the sparsity level, block-ISD relaxes this demanding requirement and is thus more practically appealing. Simulation results demonstrate that block-ISD yields better normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance than classical CS algorithms, and achieve a reduction of 84% pilot overhead than conventional channel estimation techniques."

Previous observations with the ATCA indicated the presence of anomalous neutral hydrogen (HI) deviating from the kinematics of a regularly rotating disc. We conducted follow-up observations with the MeerKAT radio telescope during the 16-dish Early Science programme as well as with the MeerLICHT optical telescope. Our more sensitive radio observations confirm the presence of anomalous gas in ESO 149-G003, and further confirm the formerly tentative detection of an extraplanar HI component in the galaxy. Employing a simple tilted-ring model, in which the kinematics is determined with only four parameters but including morphological asymmetries, we reproduce the galaxy's morphology, which shows a high degree of asymmetry. By comparing our model with the observed HI, we find that in our model we cannot account for a significant (but not dominant) fraction of the gas. From the differences between our model and the observed data cube we estimate that at least 7%-8% of the HI in the galaxy exhibits anomalous kinematics, while we estimate a minimum mass fraction of less than 1% for the morphologically confirmed extraplanar component. We investigate a number of global scaling relations and find that, besides being gas-dominated with a neutral gas-to-stellar mass ratio of 1.7, the galaxy does not show any obvious global peculiarities. Given its isolation, as confirmed by optical observations, we conclude that the galaxy is likely currently acquiring neutral gas. It is either re-accreting gas expelled from the galaxy or accreting pristine intergalactic material."

Namely, only the sign of each measurement is available to us. In many applications, the ground-truth signal is not sparse itself, but can be represented in a redundant dictionary. A strong line of research has addressed conventional CS in this signal model including its extension to one-bit measurements. However, one-bit CS suffers from the extremely large number of required measurements to achieve a predefined reconstruction error level. A common alternative to resolve this issue is to exploit adaptive schemes. Adaptive sampling acts on the acquired samples to trace the signal in an efficient way. In this work, we utilize an adaptive sampling strategy to recover dictionary-sparse signals from binary measurements. For this task, a multi-dimensional threshold is proposed to incorporate the previous signal estimates into the current sampling procedure. This strategy substantially reduces the required number of measurements for exact recovery. Our proof approach is based on the recent tools in high dimensional geometry in particular random hyperplane tessellation and Gaussian width. We show through rigorous and numerical analysis that the proposed algorithm considerably outperforms state of the art approaches. Further, our algorithm reaches an exponential error decay in terms of the number of quantized measurements."

Due to the sparse property of mmWave channel, the channel estimation can be solved as a compressed sensing (CS) problem. However, the low-resolution quantization cause severe information loss of signals, and traditional CS algorithms are unable to work well. To recovery the signal and the sparse angular domain channel from quantization, we introduce Bayesian inference and efficient vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm to solve the quantize output CS problem. To further improve the efficiency of the VAMP algorithm, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based fast computation method is derived. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed cascaded channel estimation method for the RIS-aided mmWave massive MIMO system with few-bit ADCs. Furthermore, the proposed channel estimation method can reach an acceptable performance gap between the low-resolution ADCs and the infinite ADCs for the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which implies the applicability of few-bit ADCs in practice."

We present a novel algorithmic framework that combines: (i) the approximate message passing (AMP) CS reconstruction framework, which solves the matrix channel recovery problem by iterative scalar channel denoising; (ii) a universal denoising scheme based on context quantization, which partitions the stationary ergodic signal denoising into independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) subsequence denoising; and (iii) a density estimation approach that approximates the probability distribution of an i.i.d. sequence by fitting a Gaussian mixture (GM) model.

It has been shown that Lévy flights can maximize the efficiency of resource searching in uncertain environments, and also movements of many foragers and wandering animals have been shown to follow a Lévy distribution. The reason mainly comes from that the Lévy distribution, has an infinite second moment, and hence is more likely to generate an offspring that is farther away from its parent. However, the investigation into the efficiency of other different heavy-tailed probability distributions in swarm-based searches is still insufficient up to now. For swarm-based search algorithms, randomness plays a significant role in both exploration and exploitation, or diversification and intensification. Therefore, it's necessary to discuss the optimal randomness in swarm-based search algorithms. In this study, CS is taken as a representative method of swarm-based optimization algorithms, and the results can be generalized to other swarm-based search algorithms. In this paper, four different types of commonly used heavy-tailed distributions, including Mittag-Leffler distribution, Pareto distribution, Cauchy distribution, and Weibull distribution, are considered to enhance the searching ability of CS. Then four novel CS algorithms are proposed and experiments are carried out on 20 benchmark functions to compare their searching performances. Finally, the proposed methods are used to system identification to demonstrate the effectiveness."

    "title": "Internet Protocol Version 6: Dead or Alive?",
    "summary": "Internet Protocol (IP) is the narrow waist of multilayered Internet protocol stack which defines the rules for data sent across networks. IPv4 is the fourth version of IP and first commercially available for deployment set by ARPANET in 1983 which is a 32 bit long address and can support up to 232 devices. In April 2017, all Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) confirmed that IPv4 addresses are exhausted and cannot be allocated anymore implying any new organization requesting a block of Internet addresses will be allocated IPv6. This creates troubles of interoperability, migration and deployment, and therefore organizations hesitated to use IPv6 borrowing IPv4 addresses from other big organizations instead. Currently, when IPv4 is not available, and IPv6 is not adopted for around 20 years, the question arises whether IPv6 will still be accepted by the computer society or will it have an end of life soon with alternate better protocol such as ID based networks taking its place. This paper claims that IPv6 has lost its deployment window and can be safely skipped when new ID based protocols are available which not only have simple interoperability, deployment and migration guidelines but also provide advanced features as compared to IPv6. The paper provides answers to these questions with a comprehensive comparison of IPv6 with its available alternatives and reasons of IPv6 failures in its adoption. Finally, the paper declares IPv6 as a dead protocol and suggests to use newer available protocols in future."

    "summary": "We consider signals that follow a parametric distribution where the parameter values are unknown. To estimate such signals from noisy measurements in scalar channels, we study the empirical performance of an empirical Bayes (EB) approach and a full Bayes (FB) approach. We then apply EB and FB to solve compressed sensing (CS) signal estimation problems by successively denoising a scalar Gaussian channel within an approximate message passing (AMP) framework. Our numerical results show that FB achieves better performance than EB in scalar channel denoising problems when the signal dimension is small. In the CS setting, the signal dimension must be large enough for AMP to work well; for large signal dimensions, AMP has similar performance with FB and EB."

In this work, we study end-to-end (E2E) approaches to the Mandarin-English code-switching speech recognition (CSSR) task. We first examine the effectiveness of using data augmentation and byte-pair encoding (BPE) subword units. More importantly, we propose a multitask learning recipe, where a language identification task is explicitly learned in addition to the E2E speech recognition task. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient word vocabulary expansion method for language modeling to alleviate data sparsity issues under the code-switching scenario. Experimental results on the SEAME data, a Mandarin-English CS corpus, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods."

    "title": "Sparse Recovery from Combined Fusion Frame Measurements",
    "summary": "Sparse representations have emerged as a powerful tool in signal and information processing, culminated by the success of new acquisition and processing techniques such as Compressed Sensing (CS). Fusion frames are very rich new signal representation methods that use collections of subspaces instead of vectors to represent signals. This work combines these exciting fields to introduce a new sparsity model for fusion frames. Signals that are sparse under the new model can be compressively sampled and uniquely reconstructed in ways similar to sparse signals using standard CS. The combination provides a promising new set of mathematical tools and signal models useful in a variety of applications. With the new model, a sparse signal has energy in very few of the subspaces of the fusion frame, although it does not need to be sparse within each of the subspaces it occupies. This sparsity model is captured using a mixed l1/l2 norm for fusion frames. A signal sparse in a fusion frame can be sampled using very few random projections and exactly reconstructed using a convex optimization that minimizes this mixed l1/l2 norm. The provided sampling conditions generalize coherence and RIP conditions used in standard CS theory. It is demonstrated that they are sufficient to guarantee sparse recovery of any signal sparse in our model. Moreover, a probabilistic analysis is provided using a stochastic model on the sparse signal that shows that under very mild conditions the probability of recovery failure decays exponentially with increasing dimension of the subspaces."

    "summary": "Applications of perceptual image quality assessment (IQA) in image and video processing, such as image acquisition, image compression, image restoration and multimedia communication, have led to the development of many IQA metrics. In this paper, a reliable full reference IQA model is proposed that utilize gradient similarity (GS), chromaticity similarity (CS), and deviation pooling (DP). By considering the shortcomings of the commonly used GS to model human visual system (HVS), a new GS is proposed through a fusion technique that is more likely to follow HVS. We propose an efficient and effective formulation to calculate the joint similarity map of two chromatic channels for the purpose of measuring color changes. In comparison with a commonly used formulation in the literature, the proposed CS map is shown to be more efficient and provide comparable or better quality predictions. Motivated by a recent work that utilizes the standard deviation pooling, a general formulation of the DP is presented in this paper and used to compute a final score from the proposed GS and CS maps. This proposed formulation of DP benefits from the Minkowski pooling and a proposed power pooling as well. The experimental results on six datasets of natural images, a synthetic dataset, and a digitally retouched dataset show that the proposed index provides comparable or better quality predictions than the most recent and competing state-of-the-art IQA metrics in the literature, it is reliable and has low complexity. The MATLAB source code of the proposed metric is available at https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/59809."

We identify that distributionally robust one-vs-all (OVA) classifiers often struggle in settings with imbalanced data. To address this issue, we use Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization to develop a robust version of the multiclass support vector machine (SVM) characterized by the Crammer-Singer (CS) loss. First, we prove that the CS loss is bounded from above by a Lipschitz continuous function for all and , then we exploit strong duality results to express the dual of the worst-case risk problem, and we show that the worst-case risk minimization problem admits a tractable convex reformulation due to the regularity of the CS loss. Moreover, we develop a kernel version of our proposed model to account for nonlinear class separation, and we show that it admits a tractable convex upper bound. We also propose a projected subgradient method algorithm for a special case of our proposed linear model to improve scalability. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the art OVA models in settings where the training data is highly imbalanced. We also show through experiments on popular real-world datasets that our proposed model often outperforms its regularized counterpart as the first accounts for uncertain labels unlike the latter."

    "title": "Achieving Autonomous Compressive Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radios",
    "summary": "Compressive sensing (CS) technologies present many advantages over other existing approaches for implementing wideband spectrum sensing in cognitive radios (CRs), such as reduced sampling rate and computational complexity. However, there are two significant challenges: 1) choosing an appropriate number of sub-Nyquist measurements, and 2) deciding when to terminate the greedy recovery algorithm that reconstructs wideband spectrum. In this paper, an autonomous compressive spectrum sensing (ACSS) framework is presented that enables a CR to automatically choose the number of measurements while guaranteeing the wideband spectrum recovery with a small predictable recovery error. This is realized by the proposed measurement infrastructure and the validation technique. The proposed ACSS can find a good spectral estimate with high confidence by using only a small testing subset in both noiseless and noisy environments. Furthermore, a sparsity-aware spectral recovery algorithm is proposed to recover the wideband spectrum without requiring knowledge of the instantaneous spectral sparsity level. Such an algorithm bridges the gap between CS theory and practical spectrum sensing. Simulation results show that ACSS can not only recover the spectrum using an appropriate number of measurements, but can also considerably improve the spectral recovery performance compared with existing CS approaches. The proposed recovery algorithm can autonomously adopt a proper number of iterations, therefore solving the problems of under-fitting or over-fitting which commonly exist in most greedy recovery algorithms."

In this paper we follow-up on recent concepts combining advanced MAC protocols with Compressed Sensing (CS) based multiuser detection. Specifically, we introduce a concept for sparse joint activity, channel and data detection in the context of the Coded ALOHA (FDMA) protocol. We will argue that a simple sparse activity and data detection is not sufficient (as many papers do) because control resources are in the order of the data. In addition, we will improve on the performance of such protocols in terms of the reduction of resources required for the user activity, channel estimation and data detection. We will mathematically analyze the system accordingly and provide expressions for the capture probabilities of the underlying sparse multiuser detector. Finally, we will provide structured CS algorithms for the joint estimation scheme and evaluate its performance."

We show that this is on par or improves upon known CSs for various GLMs, including Gaussian, Bernoulli, and Poisson. In particular, for the first time, our CS for Bernoulli has a -free radius where is the norm of the unknown parameter. Our first technical novelty is its derivation, which utilizes a time-uniform PAC-Bayesian bound with a uniform prior/posterior, despite the latter being a rather unpopular choice for deriving CSs. As a direct application of our new CS, we propose a simple and natural optimistic algorithm called OFUGLB, applicable to any generalized linear bandits (GLB; Filippi et al. (2010)). Our analysis shows that the celebrated optimistic approach simultaneously attains state-of-the-art regrets for various self-concordant (not necessarily bounded) GLBs, and even -free for bounded GLBs, including logistic bandits. The regret analysis, our second technical novelty, follows from combining our new CS with a new proof technique that completely avoids the previously widely used self-concordant control lemma (Faury et al., 2020, Lemma 9). Numerically, OFUGLB outperforms or is at par with prior algorithms for logistic bandits."

With high probability and up to a global unknown amplitude, we can perfectly recover such a signal if the sensing matrix is a complex Gaussian random matrix and the number of measurements is large compared to the signal sparsity. Our approach consists in recasting the (non-linear) PO-CS scheme as a linear compressive sensing model. We built it from a signal normalization constraint and a phase-consistency constraint. Practically, we achieve stable and robust signal direction estimation from the basis pursuit denoising program. Numerically, robust signal direction estimation is reached at about twice the number of measurements needed for signal recovery in compressive sensing."

    "title": "Learning-Based MIMO Channel Estimation under Spectrum Efficient Pilot Allocation and Feedback",
    "summary": "Wireless links using massive MIMO transceivers are vital for next generation wireless communications networks networks. Precoding in Massive MIMO transmission requires accurate downlink channel state information (CSI). Many recent works have effectively applied deep learning (DL) to jointly train UE-side compression networks for delay domain CSI and a BS-side decoding scheme. Vitally, these works assume that the full delay domain CSI is available at the UE, but in reality, the UE must estimate the delay domain based on a limited number of frequency domain pilots. In this work, we propose a linear pilot-to-delay (P2D) estimator that transforms sparse frequency pilots to the truncated delay CSI. We show that the P2D estimator is accurate under frequency downsampling, and we demonstrate that the P2D estimate can be effectively utilized with existing autoencoder-based CSI estimation networks. In addition to accounting for pilot-based estimates of downlink CSI, we apply unrolled optimization networks to emulate iterative solutions to compressed sensing (CS), and we demonstrate better estimation performance than prior autoencoder-based DL networks. Finally, we investigate the efficacy of trainable CS networks for in a differential encoding network for time-varying CSI estimation, and we propose a new network, MarkovNet-ISTA-ENet, comprised of both a CS network for initial CSI estimation and multiple autoencoders to estimate the error terms. We demonstrate that this heterogeneous network has better asymptotic performance than networks comprised of only one type of network."

The TL1 penalty interpolates and norms through a nonnegative parameter , similar to with , and is known to satisfy unbiasedness, sparsity and Lipschitz continuity properties. We first consider the constrained minimization problem and discuss the exact recovery of norm minimal solution based on the null space property (NSP). We then prove the stable recovery of norm minimal solution if the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property (RIP). Next, we present difference of convex algorithms for TL1 (DCATL1) in computing TL1-regularized constrained and unconstrained problems in CS. The inner loop concerns an minimization problem on which we employ the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). For the unconstrained problem, we prove convergence of DCATL1 to a stationary point satisfying the first order optimality condition. In numerical experiments, we identify the optimal value , and compare DCATL1 with other CS algorithms on two classes of sensing matrices: Gaussian random matrices and over-sampled discrete cosine transform matrices (DCT). We find that for both classes of sensing matrices, the performance of DCATL1 algorithm (initiated with minimization) always ranks near the top (if not the top), and is the most robust choice insensitive to the conditioning of the sensing matrix . DCATL1 is also competitive in comparison with DCA on other non-convex penalty functions commonly used in statistics with two hyperparameters."

    "title": "On the Fundamental Limits of Recovering Tree Sparse Vectors from Noisy Linear Measurements",
    "summary": "Recent breakthrough results in compressive sensing (CS) have established that many high dimensional signals can be accurately recovered from a relatively small number of non-adaptive linear observations, provided that the signals possess a sparse representation in some basis. Subsequent efforts have shown that the performance of CS can be improved by exploiting additional structure in the locations of the nonzero signal coefficients during inference, or by utilizing some form of data-dependent adaptive measurement focusing during the sensing process. To our knowledge, our own previous work was the first to establish the potential benefits that can be achieved when fusing the notions of adaptive sensing and structured sparsity -- that work examined the task of support recovery from noisy linear measurements, and established that an adaptive sensing strategy specifically tailored to signals that are tree-sparse can significantly outperform adaptive and non-adaptive sensing strategies that are agnostic to the underlying structure. In this work we establish fundamental performance limits for the task of support recovery of tree-sparse signals from noisy measurements, in settings where measurements may be obtained either non-adaptively (using a randomized Gaussian measurement strategy motivated by initial CS investigations) or by any adaptive sensing strategy. Our main results here imply that the adaptive tree sensing procedure analyzed in our previous work is nearly optimal, in the sense that no other sensing and estimation strategy can perform fundamentally better for identifying the support of tree-sparse signals."

    "summary": "The Compressive Sensing (CS) framework aims to ease the burden on analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) by reducing the sampling rate required to acquire and stably recover sparse signals. Practical ADCs not only sample but also quantize each measurement to a finite number of bits; moreover, there is an inverse relationship between the achievable sampling rate and the bit depth. In this paper, we investigate an alternative CS approach that shifts the emphasis from the sampling rate to the number of bits per measurement. In particular, we explore the extreme case of 1-bit CS measurements, which capture just their sign. Our results come in two flavors. First, we consider ideal reconstruction from noiseless 1-bit measurements and provide a lower bound on the best achievable reconstruction error. We also demonstrate that i.i.d. random Gaussian matrices describe measurement mappings achieving, with overwhelming probability, nearly optimal error decay. Next, we consider reconstruction robustness to measurement errors and noise and introduce the Binary -Stable Embedding (B SE) property, which characterizes the robustness measurement process to sign changes. We show the same class of matrices that provide almost optimal noiseless performance also enable such a robust mapping. On the practical side, we introduce the Binary Iterative Hard Thresholding (BIHT) algorithm for signal reconstruction from 1-bit measurements that offers state-of-the-art performance."

The sparse characteristics of mMTC makes compressed sensing (CS) approaches a promising solution to the device detection problem. However, utilizing CS-based approaches for device detection along with channel estimation, and using the acquired estimates for coherent data transmission is suboptimal, especially when the goal is to convey only a few bits of data. First, we focus on the coherent transmission and demonstrate that it is possible to obtain more accurate channel state information by combining conventional estimators with CS-based techniques. Moreover, we illustrate that even simple power control techniques can enhance the device detection performance in mMTC setups. Second, we devise a new non-coherent transmission scheme for mMTC and specifically for grant-free random access. We design an algorithm that jointly detects device activity along with embedded information bits. The approach leverages elements from the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm, and exploits the structured sparsity introduced by the non-coherent transmission scheme. Our analysis reveals that the proposed approach has superior performance compared to application of the original AMP approach."

    "summary": "Results from the TESS mission showed that previous studies strngly underestimated the number of slow rotators, revealing the importance of studying those asteroids. For most slowly rotating asteroids (P > 12), no spin and shape model is available because of observation selection effects. This hampers determination of their thermal parameters and accurate sizes. We continue our campaign in minimising selection effects among main belt asteroids. Our targets are slow rotators with low light-curve amplitudes. The goal is to provide their scaled spin and shape models together with thermal inertia, albedo, and surface roughness to complete the statistics. Rich multi-apparition datasets of dense light curves are supplemented with data from Kepler and TESS. In addition to data in the visible range, we also use thermal data from infrared space observatories (IRAS, Akari and WISE) in a combined optimisation process using the Convex Inversion Thermophysical Model (CITPM). This novel method has so far been applied to only a few targets, and in this work we further validate the method. We present the models of 16 slow rotators. All provide good fits to both thermal and visible data. The obtained sizes are on average accurate at the 5% precision, with diameters in the range from 25 to 145 km. The rotation periods of our targets range from 11 to 59 hours, and the thermal inertia covers a wide range of values, from 2 to <400 SI units, not showing any correlation with the period. With this work we increase the sample of slow rotators with reliable spin and shape models and known thermal inertia by 40%. The thermal inertia values of our sample do not display a previously suggested increasing trend with rotation period, which might be due to their small skin depth."

The QSVT framework has garnered substantial recent interest from the quantum algorithms community, as it was demonstrated by [GSLW19] to encapsulate many existing algorithms naturally phrased as an application of a matrix function. First, we posit that the lifting of quantum singular processing (QSP) to QSVT is better viewed not through Jordan's lemma (as was suggested by [GSLW19]) but as an application of the cosine-sine decomposition, which can be thought of as a more explicit and stronger version of Jordan's lemma. Second, we demonstrate that the constructions of bounded polynomial approximations given in [GSLW19], which use a variety of ad hoc approaches drawing from Fourier analysis, Chebyshev series, and Taylor series, can be unified under the framework of truncation of Chebyshev series, and indeed, can in large part be matched via a bounded variant of a standard meta-theorem from [Trefethen, 2013]. We hope this work finds use to the community as a companion guide for understanding and applying the powerful framework of [GSLW19]."

However, in most cases, the channel is composed of a few dominant taps and a large part of taps is approximately zero or zero. They are often called sparse multi-path channels (MPC). Conventional linear MPC methods, such as the least squares (LS), do not exploit the sparsity of MPC. In general, accurate sparse MPC estimator can be obtained by solving a LASSO problem even in the presence of noise. In this paper, a novel CS-based sparse MPC method by using Dantzig selector (DS) [1] is introduced.

In SPI, data is obtained through a series of compressive measurements and the corresponding image is reconstructed. Typically, the reconstruction algorithm such as basis pursuit relies on the sparsity assumption in images. However, recent advances in deep learning have found its uses in reconstructing CS images. Despite showing a promising result in simulations, it is often unclear how such an algorithm can be implemented in an actual SPI setup. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of deep learning on the reconstruction of SPI images in conjunction with block compressive sensing (BCS). We also proposed a novel reconstruction model based on convolutional neural networks that outperforms other competitive CS reconstruction algorithms. Besides, by incorporating BCS in our deep learning model, we were able to reconstruct images of any size above a certain smallest image size. In addition, we show that our model is capable of reconstructing images obtained from an SPI setup while being priorly trained on natural images, which can be vastly different from the SPI images. This opens up opportunity for the feasibility of pretrained deep learning models for CS reconstructions of images from various domain areas."

This rapid development of LLMs has outpaced our ability to properly benchmark them. Prevailing benchmarks emphasize unit-test pass rates and syntactic correctness. Such metrics understate the difficulty of many real-world problems that require planning, optimization, and strategic interaction. We introduce a multi-agent reasoning-driven benchmark based on a real-world logistics optimization problem (Auction, Pickup, and Delivery Problem) that couples competitive auctions with capacity-constrained routing. The benchmark requires building agents that can (i) bid strategically under uncertainty and (ii) optimize planners that deliver tasks while maximizing profit. We evaluate 40 LLM-coded agents (by a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs under multiple prompting methodologies, including vibe coding) against 17 human-coded agents developed before the advent of LLMs. Our results over 12 double all-play-all tournaments and k matches demonstrate (i) a clear superiority of human(graduate students)-coded agents: the top 5 spots are consistently won by human-coded agents, (ii) the majority of LLM-coded agents (33 out of 40) are beaten by very simple baselines, and (iii) given the best human solution as an input and prompted to improve upon, the best performing LLM makes the solution significantly worse instead of improving it. Our results highlight a gap in LLMs' ability to produce code that works competitively in the real-world, and motivate new evaluations that emphasize reasoning-driven code synthesis in real-world scenarios."

One is two-stage CS, which exploits row-group sparsity to estimate angle-of-arrival (AoA) first and uses the conventional 1-D CS method to obtain angle-of-departure (AoD). The other is two-dimensional (2-D) CS, which utilizes a 2-D dictionary to reconstruct the 2-D sparse signal. To conduct a meaningful comparison of the three CS frameworks, i.e., 1-D, two-stage and 2-D CS, the orthogonal match pursuit (OMP) algorithm is employed as the basic algorithm and is expanded to two variants for the proposed frameworks. Analysis and simulations demonstrate that when the 1-D CS method is compared, two-stage CS has somewhat lower performance but significantly lower computational complexity, while 2-D CS is not only the same as 1-D CS in terms of performance but also slightly lower in computational complexity than two-stage CS."

    "title": "SWAN: Swarm-Based Low-Complexity Scheme for PAPR Reduction",
    "summary": "Cyclically shifted partial transmit sequences (CS-PTS) has conventionally been used in SISO systems for PAPR reduction of OFDM signals. Compared to other techniques, CS-PTS attains superior performance. Nevertheless, due to the exhaustive search requirement, it demands excessive computational complexity. In this paper, we adapt CS-PTS to operate in a MIMO framework, where singular value decomposition (SVD) precoding is employed. We also propose SWAN, a novel optimization method based on swarm intelligence to circumvent the exhaustive search. SWAN not only provides a significant reduction in computational complexity, but it also attains a fair balance between optimality and complexity. Through simulations, we show that SWAN achieves near-optimal performance at a much lower complexity than other competing approaches."

    "title": "An Embedded Index Code Construction Using Sub-packetization",
    "summary": "A variant of the index coding problem (ICP), the embedded index coding problem (EICP) was introduced in [A. Porter and M. Wootters, \"Embedded index coding,\" ITW, Sweden, 2019] which was motivated by its application in distributed computing where every user can act as sender for other users and an algorithm for code construction was reported. The constructions depends on the computation of minrank of a matrix, which is computationally intensive. In [A. Mahesh, N. Sageer Karat and B. S. Rajan, \"Min-rank of Embedded Index Coding Problems,\" ISIT, 2020], for EICP, a notion of side-information matrix was introduced and it was proved that the length of an optimal scalar linear index code is equal to the min-rank of the side-information matrix. The authors have provided an explicit code construction for a class of EICP - Consecutive and Symmetric Embedded Index Coding Problem (CS-EICP) . We introduce the idea of sub-packetization of the messages in index coding problems to provide a novel code construction for CS-EICP in contrast to the scalar linear solutions provided in the prior works. For CS-EICP, the normalized rate, which is defined as the number of bits transmitted by all the users together normalized by the total number of bits of all the messages, for our construction is lesser than the normalized rate achieved by Mahesh et al.,for scalar linear codes."

Comparison is done by measuring the image quality versus number of samples used for image recovering. Images are visually compared. Also, numerical quality value, PSNR, is calculated and compared for the two approaches. It is shown that images, recovered by using the Compressive Sensing approach, have higher PSNR values compared to the images under JPEG compression. Difference is larger in grayscale images with small number of details, like e.g. medical images (x-ray). The theory is supported by the experimental results."

    "title": "Wireless Networks for Mobile Edge Computing: Spatial Modeling and Latency Analysis (Extended version)",
    "summary": "Next-generation wireless networks will provide users ubiquitous low-latency computing services using devices at the network edge, called mobile edge computing (MEC). The key operation of MEC, mobile computation offloading (MCO), is to offload computation intensive tasks from users. Since each edge device comprises an access point (AP) and a computer server (CS), a MEC network can be decomposed as a radio access network (RAN) cascaded with a CS network (CSN). Based on the architecture, we investigate network constrained latency performance, namely communication latency (comm-latency) and computation latency (comp-latency) under the constraints of RAN coverage and CSN stability. To this end, a spatial random network is modeled featuring random node distribution, parallel computing, non-orthogonal multiple access, and random computation-task generation. Given the model and the said network constraints, we derive the scaling laws of comm-latency and comp-latency with respect to network-load parameters (density of mobiles and their task-generation rates) and network-resource parameters (bandwidth, density of APs/CSs, CS computation rate). Essentially, the analysis involves the interplay of theories of stochastic geometry, queueing, and parallel computing. Combining the derived scaling laws quantifies the tradeoffs between the latencies, network coverage and network stability. The results provide useful guidelines for MEC-network provisioning and planning by avoiding either of the cascaded RAN or CSN being a performance bottleneck."

    "title": "Designing Theory of Computing Backwards",
    "summary": "The design of any technical Computer Science course must involve its context within the institution's CS program, but also incorporate any new material that is relevant and appropriately accessible to students. In many institutions, theory of computing (ToC) courses within undergraduate CS programs are often placed near the end of the program, and have a very common structure of building off previous sections of the course. The central question behind any such course is ``What are the limits of computers?'' for various types of computational models. However, what is often intuitive for students about what a ``computer'' is--a Turing machine--is taught at the end of the course, which necessitates motivation for earlier models. This poster contains our experiences in designing a ToC course that teaches the material effectively ``backwards,'' with pedagogic motivation of instead asking the question ``What suitable restrictions can we place on computers to make their problems tractable?'' We also give recommendations for future course design."

    "summary": "Spike-based temporal messaging enables SNNs to efficiently process both purely temporal and spatio-temporal time-series or event-driven data. Combining SNNs with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a variant of recurrent neural networks, gives rise to a robust framework for sequential data processing; however, traditional RNNs often lose local details when handling long sequences. Previous approaches, such as SpikGRU, fail to capture fine-grained local dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we introduce the Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, which leverages convolutional operations to preserve local structure and dependencies while integrating the temporal precision of spiking neurons with the efficient gating mechanisms of GRUs. This versatile architecture excels on both temporal datasets (NTIDIGITS, SHD) and spatio-temporal benchmarks (MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS). Our experiments show that CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an average of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to 99.31% on MNIST. It is worth noting that our solution achieves 69% higher efficiency compared to SpikGRU. The code is available at: https://github.com/YesmineAbdennadher/CS-GRU."

Traditional monostatic or localization-based sensing methods, however, encounter challenges in fusing sensing results and matching channel parameters. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative approach that directly draws the radio images of the low-altitude space, leveraging its inherent sparsity with compressed sensing (CS)-based algorithms and the cooperation of multiple base stations. Furthermore, recognizing that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are randomly distributed in space, we introduce a physics-embedded learning method to overcome off-grid issues inherent in CS-based models. Additionally, an online hard example mining method is incorporated into the design of the loss function, enabling the network to adaptively concentrate on the samples bearing significant discrepancy with the ground truth, thereby enhancing its ability to detect the rare UAVs within the expansive low-altitude space. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the imaging-based low-altitude surveillance approach, with the proposed physics-embedded learning algorithm significantly outperforming traditional CS-based methods under off-grid conditions."

    "summary": "Motivated by alleviating CO pollution, Electric Vehicle (EV) based applications have recently received wide interests from both commercial and research communities by using electric energy instead of traditional fuel energy. Although EVs are inherently with limited travelling distance, such limitation could be overcome by deploying public Charging Stations (CSs) to recharge EVs battery during their journeys. In this paper we propose a novel communication framework for on-the-move EV charging scenario, based on the Publish/Subscribe (P/S) mechanism for disseminating necessary CS information to EVs, in order for them to make optimized decisions on where to charge. A core part of our communication framework is the utilization of Road Side Units (RSUs) to bridge the information flow from CSs to EVs, which has been regarded as a type of cost-efficient communication infrastructure. Under this design, we introduce two complementary communication modes of signalling protocols, namely Push and Pull Modes, in order to enable the required information dissemination operation. Both analysis and simulation show the advantage of Pull Mode, in which the information is cached at RSUs to support asynchronous communication. We further propose a remote reservation service based on the Pull Mode, such that the CS-selection decision making can utilize the knowledge of EVs' charging reservation, as published from EVs through RSUs to CSs. Results show that both the performance at CS and EV sides are further improved based on using this anticipated information."

    "title": "Binary Compressive Sensing via Analog Fountain Coding",
    "summary": "In this paper, a compressive sensing (CS) approach is proposed for sparse binary signals' compression and reconstruction based on analog fountain codes (AFCs). In the proposed scheme, referred to as the analog fountain compressive sensing (AFCS), each measurement is generated from a linear combination of L randomly selected binary signal elements with real weight coefficients. The weight coefficients are chosen from a finite weight set and L, called measurement degree, is obtained based on a predefined degree distribution function. We propose a simple verification based reconstruction algorithm for the AFCS in the noiseless case. The proposed verification based decoder is analyzed through SUM-OR tree analytical approach and an optimization problem is formulated to find the optimum measurement degree to minimize the number of measurements required for the reconstruction of binary sparse signals. We show that in the AFCS, the number of required measurements is of O(-n log(1-k/n)), where n is the signal length and k is the signal sparsity level. We then consider the signal reconstruction of AFCS in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and the standard message passing decoder is then used for the signal recovery. Simulation results show that the AFCS can perfectly recover all non-zero elements of the sparse binary signal with a significantly reduced number of measurements, compared to the conventional binary CS and L1-minimization approaches in a wide range of signal to noise ratios (SNRs). Finally, we show a practical application of the AFCS for the sparse event detection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), where the sensors' readings can be treated as measurements from the CS point of view."

To better capture the relationship between features and the class, class labels are separated into individual variables and relevance and redundancy are explicitly handled on each class label. Super-efficiency DEA is employed to evaluate and rank features via their conditional dependence scores on all class labels, and the feature with maximum super-efficiency score is then added in the conditioning set for conditional dependence estimation in the next iteration, in such a way as to iteratively select features and get the final selected features. Eventually, experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed method comparing with four state-of-the-art methods from the viewpoint of classification accuracy. Empirical results verify the feasibility and the superiority of proposed feature selection method."

    "summary": "Approximate message passing (AMP) is an efficient iterative signal recovery algorithm for compressed sensing (CS). For sensing matrices with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian entries, the behavior of AMP can be asymptotically described by a scaler recursion called state evolution. Orthogonal AMP (OAMP) is a variant of AMP that imposes a divergence-free constraint on the denoiser. In this paper, we extend OAMP to incorporate generic denoisers, hence the name D-OAMP. Our numerical results show that state evolution predicts the performance of D-OAMP well for generic denoisers when i.i.d. Gaussian or partial orthogonal sensing matrices are involved. We compare the performances of denosing-AMP (D-AMP) and D-OAMP for recovering natural images from CS measurements. Simulation results show that D-OAMP outperforms D-AMP in both convergence speed and recovery accuracy for partial orthogonal sensing matrices."

    "title": "Collaborative Compressive Detection with Physical Layer Secrecy Constraints",
    "summary": "This paper considers the problem of detecting a high dimensional signal (not necessarily sparse) based on compressed measurements with physical layer secrecy guarantees. First, we propose a collaborative compressive detection (CCD) framework to compensate for the performance loss due to compression with a single sensor. We characterize the trade-off between dimensionality reduction achieved by a universal compressive sensing (CS) based measurement scheme and the achievable performance of CCD analytically. Next, we consider a scenario where the network operates in the presence of an eavesdropper who wants to discover the state of the nature being monitored by the system. To keep the data secret from the eavesdropper, we propose to use cooperating trustworthy nodes that assist the fusion center (FC) by injecting artificial noise to deceive the eavesdropper. We seek the answers to the questions: Does CS help improve the security performance in such a framework? What are the optimal values of parameters which maximize the CS based collaborative detection performance at the FC while ensuring perfect secrecy at the eavesdropper?"

ISR is a special case of CCR where only contains 1. We also propose new reconfiguration rules: component jumping (CJ) and component sliding (CS), which regard connected components as tokens. Since CCR generalizes ISR, the problem is PSPACE-complete. In contrast, we show three positive results: First, CCR-CS and CCR-CJ are solvable in linear and quadratic time, respectively, when is a path. Second, we show that CCR-CS is solvable in linear time for cographs. Third, when contains only the same elements (i.e., all connected components have the same size), we show that CCR-CJ is solvable in linear time if is chordal. The second and third results generalize known results for ISR and exhibit an interesting difference between the reconfiguration rules."

    "summary": "Recall one time when we were in an unfamiliar mall. We might mistakenly think that there exists or does not exist a piece of glass in front of us. Such mistakes will remind us to walk more safely and freely at the same or a similar place next time. To absorb the human mistake correction wisdom, we propose a novel glass segmentation network to detect transparent glass, dubbed GlassSegNet. Motivated by this human behavior, GlassSegNet utilizes two key stages: the identification stage (IS) and the correction stage (CS). The IS is designed to simulate the detection procedure of human recognition for identifying transparent glass by global context and edge information. The CS then progressively refines the coarse prediction by correcting mistake regions based on gained experience. Extensive experiments show clear improvements of our GlassSegNet over thirty-four state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets."

Traditionally Compressed Sensing (CS) based techniques have been employed for this task. These are transductive inversion processes, the problem with these approaches is that the inversion is time-consuming and hence not suitable for real-time applications. With the recent advent of deep learning, Stacked Sparse Denoising Autoencoder (SSDAE) has been used for learning inversion in an inductive setup. The training period for inductive learning is large but is very fast during application -- capable of real-time speed. This work proposes a new approach for inductive learning of the inversion process. It is based on Coupled Analysis Dictionary Learning. Results on Biomedical signal reconstruction show that our proposed approach is very fast and yields result far better than CS and SSDAE."

    "title": "General Phase Regularized Reconstruction using Phase Cycling",
    "summary": "Purpose: To develop a general phase regularized image reconstruction method, with applications to partial Fourier imaging, water-fat imaging and flow imaging. Theory and Methods: The problem of enforcing phase constraints in reconstruction was studied under a regularized inverse problem framework. A general phase regularized reconstruction algorithm was proposed to enable various joint reconstruction of partial Fourier imaging, water-fat imaging and flow imaging, along with parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS). Since phase regularized reconstruction is inherently non-convex and sensitive to phase wraps in the initial solution, a reconstruction technique, named phase cycling, was proposed to render the overall algorithm invariant to phase wraps. The proposed method was applied to retrospectively under-sampled in vivo datasets and compared with state of the art reconstruction methods. Results: Phase cycling reconstructions showed reduction of artifacts compared to reconstructions with- out phase cycling and achieved similar performances as state of the art results in partial Fourier, water-fat and divergence-free regularized flow reconstruction. Joint reconstruction of partial Fourier + water-fat imaging + PI + CS, and partial Fourier + divergence-free regularized flow imaging + PI + CS were demonstrated. Conclusion: The proposed phase cycling reconstruction provides an alternative way to perform phase regularized reconstruction, without the need to perform phase unwrapping. It is robust to the choice of initial solutions and encourages the joint reconstruction of phase imaging applications."

    "title": "Operational Support Estimator Networks",
    "summary": "In this work, we propose a novel approach called Operational Support Estimator Networks (OSENs) for the support estimation task. Support Estimation (SE) is defined as finding the locations of non-zero elements in sparse signals. By its very nature, the mapping between the measurement and sparse signal is a non-linear operation. Traditional support estimators rely on computationally expensive iterative signal recovery techniques to achieve such non-linearity. Contrary to the convolutional layers, the proposed OSEN approach consists of operational layers that can learn such complex non-linearities without the need for deep networks. In this way, the performance of non-iterative support estimation is greatly improved. Moreover, the operational layers comprise so-called generative super neurons with non-local kernels. The kernel location for each neuron/feature map is optimized jointly for the SE task during training. We evaluate the OSENs in three different applications: i. support estimation from Compressive Sensing (CS) measurements, ii. representation-based classification, and iii. learning-aided CS reconstruction where the output of OSENs is used as prior knowledge to the CS algorithm for enhanced reconstruction. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves computational efficiency and outperforms competing methods, especially at low measurement rates by significant margins. The software implementation is shared at https://github.com/meteahishali/OSEN."

    "title": "Wafer-Scale Fast Fourier Transforms",
    "summary": "We have implemented fast Fourier transforms for one, two, and three-dimensional arrays on the Cerebras CS-2, a system whose memory and processing elements reside on a single silicon wafer. The wafer-scale engine (WSE) encompasses a two-dimensional mesh of roughly 850,000 processing elements (PEs) with fast local memory and equally fast nearest-neighbor interconnections. Our wafer-scale FFT (wsFFT) parallelizes a problem with up to PEs. At this point a PE processes only a single vector of the 3D domain (known as a pencil) per superstep, where each of the three supersteps performs FFT along one of the three axes of the input array. Between supersteps, wsFFT redistributes (transposes) the data to bring all elements of each one-dimensional pencil being transformed into the memory of a single PE. Each redistribution causes an all-to-all communication along one of the mesh dimensions. Given the level of parallelism, the size of the messages transmitted between pairs of PEs can be as small as a single word. In theory, a mesh is not ideal for all-to-all communication due to its limited bisection bandwidth. However, the mesh interconnecting PEs on the WSE lies entirely on-wafer and achieves nearly peak bandwidth even with tiny messages. This high efficiency on fine-grain communication allow wsFFT to achieve unprecedented levels of parallelism and performance. We analyse in detail computation and communication time, as well as the weak and strong scaling, using both FP16 and FP32 precision. With 32-bit arithmetic on the CS-2, we achieve 959 microseconds for 3D FFT of a complex input array using a 512x512 subgrid of the on-wafer PEs. This is the largest ever parallelization for this problem size and the first implementation that breaks the millisecond barrier."

We use analytic arguments to show that the number of routing control messages per topology change cannot scale better than linearly on Internet-like topologies. We also employ simulations to confirm that logarithmic routing table size scaling gets broken by topology-independent addressing, a cornerstone of popular locator-identifier split proposals aiming at improving routing scaling in the presence of network topology dynamics or host mobility. These pessimistic findings lead us to the conclusion that a fundamental re-examination of assumptions behind routing models and abstractions is needed in order to find a routing architecture that would be able to scale ``indefinitely.''"

Despite the fact that CS have not yet been reliable detected, there are several strong independent indications of the existence of the CS, based of CMB analysis and search of gravitational lens chains with special properties. However, early considered models of straight CS presented only a small fraction of the general CS-configurations to be observed. Now we propose model which could significantly increase the possibilities of CS observational search.

Moreover, most traditional reinforcement learning approaches explicitly separate learning and decision making in a way that does not correspond to biological learning. We implement an architecture founded in principles of experimental neuroscience, by combining computationally efficient abstractions of biological algorithms. Our approach is inspired by research on spike-timing dependent plasticity, the transition between short and long term memory, and the role of various neurotransmitters in rewarding curiosity. The Neurons-in-a-Box architecture can learn in a wholly generalizable manner, and demonstrates an efficient way to build and apply representations without explicitly optimizing over a set of criteria or actions.

For such a scenario, we design new algorithms for source coding with the objective of achieving good reconstruction performance of the sparse signal. Our approach is based on an analysis-by-synthesis principle at the encoder, consisting of two main steps: (1) the synthesis step uses a sparse signal reconstruction technique for measuring the direct effect of quantization of CS measurements on the final sparse signal reconstruction quality, and (2) the analysis step decides appropriate quantized values to maximize the final sparse signal reconstruction quality. Through simulations, we compare the performance of the proposed quantization algorithms vis-a-vis existing quantization schemes."

Previous studies constrained the evolution of q with redshift, finding a mild but significant decline, that is yet to be understood. For the first time, we calibrate q as a function of both stellar mass (M ) and redshift, starting from an M -selected sample of 400,000 star-forming galaxies in the COSMOS field, identified via (NUV-r)/(r-J) colours, at redshifts 0.1 z 4.5. Within each (M ,z) bin, we stack the deepest available infrared/sub-mm and radio images. We fit the stacked IR spectral energy distributions with typical star-forming galaxy and IR-AGN templates, and carefully remove radio AGN candidates via a recursive approach. We find that the IRRC evolves primarily with M , with more massive galaxies displaying systematically lower q . A secondary, weaker dependence on redshift is also observed. The best-fit analytical expression is the following: q (M ,z)=(2.646 0.024) (1+z) -(0.148 0.013) ( /M -10). The lower IR/radio ratios seen in more massive galaxies are well described by their higher observed SFR surface densities. Our findings highlight that using radio-synchrotron emission as a proxy for SFR requires novel M -dependent recipes, that will enable us to convert detections from future ultra deep radio surveys into accurate SFR measurements down to low-SFR, low-M galaxies."

Nonetheless, (i) No study has been conducted on video analysis and action recognition of CS: GO game-play which can play a substantial role in the gaming industry for prediction model (ii) No work has been done on the real-time application on the actions and results of a CS: GO match (iii) Game data of a match is usually available in the HLTV as a CSV formatted file however it does not have open access and HLTV tends to prevent users from taking data. This manuscript aims to develop a model for accurate prediction of 4 different actions and compare the performance among the five different transfer learning models with our self-developed deep neural network and identify the best-fitted model and also including major voting later on, which is qualified to provide real time prediction and the result of this model aids to the construction of the automated system of gathering and processing more data alongside solving the issue of collecting data from HLTV."

    "title": "Robustly Stable Signal Recovery in Compressed Sensing with Structured Matrix Perturbation",
    "summary": "The sparse signal recovery in the standard compressed sensing (CS) problem requires that the sensing matrix be known a priori. Such an ideal assumption may not be met in practical applications where various errors and fluctuations exist in the sensing instruments. This paper considers the problem of compressed sensing subject to a structured perturbation in the sensing matrix. Under mild conditions, it is shown that a sparse signal can be recovered by minimization and the recovery error is at most proportional to the measurement noise level, which is similar to the standard CS result. In the special noise free case, the recovery is exact provided that the signal is sufficiently sparse with respect to the perturbation level. The formulated structured sensing matrix perturbation is applicable to the direction of arrival estimation problem, so has practical relevance. Algorithms are proposed to implement the minimization problem and numerical simulations are carried out to verify the result obtained."

Using Google Scholar, we gathered data about publication citations for 5,574 tenure-track faculty from 185 U.S. universities. For each faculty, we extracted their t10 index, defined as the number of citations received by their 10th highest cited paper. For each department, we calculated four quality metrics: median t10 (m10), the geometric mean of t10 (g10), and the number of well-cited faculty with t10 above 40% (c40) and 60% (c60) of the national average. We fitted a linear regression model using those four measures to match the 2022 U.S. News ranking scores of CS doctoral programs.

    "summary": "A pre-trained generator has been frequently adopted in compressed sensing (CS) due to its ability to effectively estimate signals with the prior of NNs. In order to further refine the NN-based prior, we propose a framework that allows the generator to utilize additional information from a given measurement for prior learning, thereby yielding more accurate prediction for signals. As our framework has a simple form, it is easily applied to existing CS methods using pre-trained generators. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our framework exhibits uniformly superior performances by large margin and can reduce the reconstruction error up to an order of magnitude for some applications. We also explain the experimental success in theory by showing that our framework can slightly relax the stringent signal presence condition, which is required to guarantee the success of signal recovery."

However, existing heterogeneous graph-based community search methods need help identifying cross-group communities and suffer from efficiency issues, making them unsuitable for large graphs. This paper presents a fast community search model based on the Butterfly-Core Community (BCC) structure for heterogeneous graphs. The Random Walk with Restart (RWR) algorithm and butterfly degree comprehensively evaluate the importance of vertices within communities, allowing leader vertices to be rapidly updated to maintain cross-group cohesion. Moreover, we devised a more efficient method for updating vertex distances, which minimizes vertex visits and enhances operational efficiency. Extensive experiments on several real-world temporal graphs demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this solution."

A condition to ensure the numerical performance of sparse recovery algorithms is the design of a sensing matrix with low mutual coherence. Without fixing any part of the sampling pattern, we propose sampling points that minimize the mutual coherence of the respective sensing matrix by using augmented Lagrangian method. Numerical experiments show that the proposed sampling scheme yields a higher recovery success in terms of phase transition diagram when compared to other known sampling patterns, such as the spiral and Hammersley sampling schemes. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the application of CS with an optimized sensing matrix requires fewer samples than classical approaches to reconstruct the Spherical Mode Coefficients (SMCs) and far-field pattern."

    "title": "The Power of Triply Complementary Priors for Image Compressive Sensing",
    "summary": "Recent works that utilized deep models have achieved superior results in various image restoration applications. Such approach is typically supervised which requires a corpus of training images with distribution similar to the images to be recovered. On the other hand, the shallow methods which are usually unsupervised remain promising performance in many inverse problems, , image compressive sensing (CS), as they can effectively leverage non-local self-similarity priors of natural images. However, most of such methods are patch-based leading to the restored images with various ringing artifacts due to naive patch aggregation. Using either approach alone usually limits performance and generalizability in image restoration tasks. In this paper, we propose a joint low-rank and deep (LRD) image model, which contains a pair of triply complementary priors, namely external and internal , deep and shallow , and local and non-local priors. We then propose a novel hybrid plug-and-play (H-PnP) framework based on the LRD model for image CS. To make the optimization tractable, a simple yet effective algorithm is proposed to solve the proposed H-PnP based image CS problem. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed H-PnP algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for image CS recovery such as SCSNet and WNNM."

    "summary": "Compressive sensing (CS) is a method of sampling which permits some classes of signals to be reconstructed with high accuracy even when they were under-sampled. In this paper we explore a phenomenon in which bandwise CS sampling of a hyperspectral data cube followed by reconstruction can actually result in amplification of chemical signals contained in the cube. Perhaps most surprisingly, chemical signal amplification generally seems to increase as the level of sampling decreases. In some examples, the chemical signal is significantly stronger in a data cube reconstructed from 10% CS sampling than it is in the raw, 100% sampled data cube. We explore this phenomenon in two real-world datasets including the Physical Sciences Inc. Fabry-Pérot interferometer sensor multispectral dataset and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab FTIR-based longwave infrared sensor hyperspectral dataset. Each of these datasets contains the release of a chemical simulant, such as glacial acetic acid, triethyl phospate, and sulfur hexafluoride, and in all cases we use the adaptive coherence estimator (ACE) to detect a target signal in the hyperspectral data cube. We end the paper by suggesting some theoretical justifications for why chemical signals would be amplified in CS sampled and reconstructed hyperspectral data cubes and discuss some practical implications."

The goal is to study charge transport in the CS using a conducting polymer (PANi) as a binder and compare with that occurring at CS/PEO. A conductivity maxima was observed in the CS/PEO composite but was absent in CS/PANi. Our data analysis shows that variable range hopping of electrons between polymeric chains in PANi-filled gaps between CS takes on a predominant part in transport through CS/PANi composites, whereas in CS/PEO composites, electrons travel through gaps between CS solely by means of direct tunneling. This difference in transport mechanisms results in different temperature dependences of the conductivity."

    "summary": "We propose a deep learning system for attention-guided dual-layer image compression (AGDL). In the AGDL compression system, an image is encoded into two layers, a base layer and an attention-guided refinement layer. Unlike the existing ROI image compression methods that spend an extra bit budget equally on all pixels in ROI, AGDL employs a CNN module to predict those pixels on and near a saliency sketch within ROI that are critical to perceptual quality. Only the critical pixels are further sampled by compressive sensing (CS) to form a very compact refinement layer. Another novel CNN method is developed to jointly decode the two compression layers for a much refined reconstruction, while strictly satisfying the transmitted CS constraints on perceptually critical pixels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AGDL system advances the state of the art in perception-aware image compression."

    "summary": "Mapping a truncated optimization method into a deep neural network, deep unfolding network (DUN) has attracted growing attention in compressive sensing (CS) due to its good interpretability and high performance. Each stage in DUNs corresponds to one iteration in optimization. By understanding DUNs from the perspective of the human brain's memory processing, we find there exists two issues in existing DUNs. One is the information between every two adjacent stages, which can be regarded as short-term memory, is usually lost seriously. The other is no explicit mechanism to ensure that the previous stages affect the current stage, which means memory is easily forgotten. To solve these issues, in this paper, a novel DUN with persistent memory for CS is proposed, dubbed Memory-Augmented Deep Unfolding Network (MADUN). We design a memory-augmented proximal mapping module (MAPMM) by combining two types of memory augmentation mechanisms, namely High-throughput Short-term Memory (HSM) and Cross-stage Long-term Memory (CLM). HSM is exploited to allow DUNs to transmit multi-channel short-term memory, which greatly reduces information loss between adjacent stages. CLM is utilized to develop the dependency of deep information across cascading stages, which greatly enhances network representation capability. Extensive CS experiments on natural and MR images show that with the strong ability to maintain and balance information our MADUN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

    "summary": "The low-altitude economy is emerging as a key driver of future economic growth, necessitating effective flight activity surveillance using existing mobile cellular network sensing capabilities. However, traditional monostatic and localizationbased sensing methods face challenges in fusing sensing results and matching channel parameters. To address these challenges, we model low-altitude surveillance as a compressed sensing (CS)-based imaging problem by leveraging the cooperation of multiple base stations and the inherent sparsity of aerial images. Additionally, we derive the point spread function to analyze the influences of different antenna, subcarrier, and resolution settings on the imaging performance. Given the random spatial distribution of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), we propose a physics-embedded learning method to mitigate off-grid errors in traditional CS-based approaches. Furthermore, to enhance rare UAV detection in vast low-altitude airspace, we integrate an online hard example mining scheme into the loss function design, enabling the network to adaptively focus on samples with significant discrepancies from the ground truth during training. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed low-altitude surveillance framework. The proposed physicsembedded learning algorithm achieves a 97.55% detection rate, significantly outperforming traditional CS-based methods under off-grid conditions.

This non-uniform sampling, achieved by narrow-band modulation of the RF instantaneous sample rate, results in a frequency domain point spread function that is between the extremes obtained by uniform sampling and totally random sampling. As a result, while still preserving structured aliasing, the modulated sampling scheme is also useful in a compressive sensing (CS) setting. We estimate restricted isometry property (RIP) constants for CS matrices induced by such modulated sampling schemes and use those estimates to determine the amount of sparsity needed for signal recovery. This is followed by a demonstration and analysis of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit's ability to reconstruct signals from noisy non-uniform samples."

While a myriad of powerful deep learning models have been developed for this task, few works have explored the robustness of MTS forecasting models to malicious attacks, which is crucial for their trustworthy employment in high-stake scenarios. To address this gap, we dive deep into the backdoor attacks on MTS forecasting models and propose an effective attack method named BackTime.By subtly injecting a few stealthy triggers into the MTS data, BackTime can alter the predictions of the forecasting model according to the attacker's intent. Specifically, BackTime first identifies vulnerable timestamps in the data for poisoning, and then adaptively synthesizes stealthy and effective triggers by solving a bi-level optimization problem with a GNN-based trigger generator. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and state-of-the-art MTS forecasting models demonstrate the effectiveness, versatility, and stealthiness of attacks.

The sp(N,R) BG CS take the form of multimode ordinary Schrödinger cat states. Macroscopic superpositions of 2^ n-1 sp(N,R) CS (2^n canonical CS, n=1,2,...) are pointed out which are overcomplete in the N-mode Hilbert space and the relation between the canonical CS and the u(p,q) BG-type CS representations is established. The sets of u(p,q) and sp(N,R) BG CS and their discrete superpositions contain many states studied in quantum optics (even and odd N-mode CS, pair CS) and provide an approach to quadrature squeezing, alternative to that of intelligent states. New subsets of weakly and strongly nonclassical states are pointed out and their statistical properties (first- and second-order squeezing, photon number distributions) are discussed. For specific values of the angle parameters and small amplitude of the canonical CS components these states approaches multimode Fock states with one, two or three bosons/photons. It is shown that eigenstates of a squared non-Hermitian operator A^2 (generalized cat states) can exhibit squeezing of the quadratures of A."

We introduce a new model that can efficiently restrict the degrees of freedom of the problem and is generic enough to find a lot of applications, for instance in multichannel signal compressed sensing (e.g. sensor networks, hyperspectral imaging) and compressive sparse principal component analysis (s-PCA). We assume data matrices have a simultaneous low-rank and joint sparse structure, and we propose a novel approach for efficient compressed sensing (CS) of such data. Our CS recovery approach is based on a convex minimization problem that incorporates this restrictive structure by jointly regularizing the solutions with their nuclear (trace) norm and l2/l1 mixed norm. Our theoretical analysis uses a new notion of restricted isometry property (RIP) and shows that, for sampling schemes satisfying RIP, our approach can stably recover all low-rank and joint-sparse matrices. For a certain class of random sampling schemes satisfying a particular concentration bound (e.g. the subgaussian ensembles) we derive a lower bound on the number of CS measurements indicating the near-optimality of our recovery approach as well as a significant enhancement compared to the state-of-the-art. We introduce an iterative algorithm based on proximal calculus in order to solve the joint nuclear and l2/l1 norms minimization problem and, finally, we illustrate the empirical recovery phase transition of this approach by series of numerical experiments."

First-order optimizers that use the CS formulation to find EPO solutions encounter practical problems of oscillations and stagnation that affect convergence. Moreover, when initialized with a PO solution, they do not guarantee a controlled trajectory that lies completely on the PF. These shortcomings lead to modeling limitations and computational inefficiency in multi-task learning (MTL) and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods that utilize CS for their underlying non-convex multi-objective optimization (MOO). To address these shortcomings, we design a new MOO method, EPO Search. We prove that EPO Search converges to an EPO solution and empirically illustrate its computational efficiency and robustness to initialization. When initialized on the PF, EPO Search can trace the PF and converge to the required EPO solution at a linear rate of convergence. Using EPO Search we develop new algorithms: PESA-EPO for approximating the PF in a posteriori MCDM, and GP-EPO for preference elicitation in interactive MCDM; experiments on benchmark datasets confirm their advantages over competing alternatives. EPO Search scales linearly with the number of decision variables which enables its use for training deep networks. Empirical results on real data from personalized medicine, e-commerce and hydrometeorology demonstrate the efficacy of EPO Search for deep MTL."

The received SAR echo is decomposed into the sum of basis sub-signals, which are generated by discretizing the target spatial domain and velocity domain and synthesizing the SAR received data for every discretized spatial position and velocity candidate. In this way, the SAR imaging problem is converted into sub-signal selection problem. In the case that moving targets are sparsely distributed in the observed scene, their reflectivities, positions and velocities can be obtained by using the CS technique. It is shown that, compared with traditional algorithms, the target image obtained by the proposed algorithm has higher resolution and lower side-lobe while the required number of measurements can be an order of magnitude less than that by sampling at Nyquist sampling rate. Moreover, multiple targets with different speeds can be imaged simultaneously, so the proposed algorithm has higher efficiency."

    "summary": "Nowadays, the demand for image transmission over wireless networks has surged significantly. To meet the need for swift delivery of high-quality images through time-varying channels with limited bandwidth, the development of efficient transmission strategies and techniques for preserving image quality is of importance. This paper introduces an innovative approach to Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) tailored for wireless image transmission. It capitalizes on the power of Compressed Sensing (CS) to achieve superior compression and resilience to channel noise. In this method, the process begins with the compression of images using a block-based CS technique implemented through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) structure. Subsequently, the images are encoded by directly mapping image blocks to complex-valued channel input symbols. Upon reception, the data is decoded to recover the channel-encoded information, effectively removing the noise introduced during transmission. To finalize the process, a novel CNN-based reconstruction network is employed to restore the original image from the channel-decoded data. The performance of the proposed method is assessed using the CIFAR-10 and Kodak datasets. The results illustrate a substantial improvement over existing JSCC frameworks when assessed in terms of metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) across various channel Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) and channel bandwidth values. These findings underscore the potential of harnessing CNN-based CS for the development of deep JSCC algorithms tailored for wireless image transmission."

    "summary": "Incomplete relevance judgments limit the reusability of test collections. When new systems are compared to previous systems that contributed to the pool, they often face a disadvantage. This is due to pockets of unjudged documents (called holes) in the test collection that the new systems return. The very nature of Conversational Search (CS) means that these holes are potentially larger and more problematic when evaluating systems. In this paper, we aim to extend CS test collections by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to fill holes by leveraging existing judgments. We explore this problem using TREC iKAT 23 and TREC CAsT 22 collections, where information needs are highly dynamic and the responses are much more varied, leaving bigger holes to fill. Our experiments reveal that CS collections show a trend towards less reusability in deeper turns. Also, fine-tuning the Llama 3.1 model leads to high agreement with human assessors, while few-shot prompting the ChatGPT results in low agreement with humans. Consequently, filling the holes of a new system using ChatGPT leads to a higher change in the location of the new system. While regenerating the assessment pool with few-shot prompting the ChatGPT model and using it for evaluation achieves a high rank correlation with human-assessed pools. We show that filling the holes using few-shot training the Llama 3.1 model enables a fairer comparison between the new system and the systems contributed to the pool. Our hole-filling model based on few-shot training of the Llama 3.1 model can improve the reusability of test collections."

GPs are widely used in BO because they easily enable exploration based on posterior uncertainty bands. However, this convenience comes at the cost of robustness: a typical function encountered in practice is unlikely to have been drawn from the data scientist's prior, in which case uncertainty estimates can be misleading, and the resulting exploration can be suboptimal. We present a frequentist approach to GP/BO uncertainty quantification. We utilize the GP framework as a working model, but do not assume correctness of the prior. We instead construct a confidence sequence (CS) for the unknown function using martingale techniques. There is a necessary cost to achieving robustness: if the prior was correct, posterior GP bands are narrower than our CS. Nevertheless, when the prior is wrong, our CS is statistically valid and empirically outperforms standard GP methods, in terms of both coverage and utility for BO. Additionally, we demonstrate that powered likelihoods provide robustness against model misspecification."

Although many deep learning-based CS-MRI methods have been proposed to mitigate the problems of traditional methods, they have not been able to achieve more robust results at higher acceleration factors. Most of the deep learning-based CS-MRI methods still can not fully mine the information from the k-space, which leads to unsatisfactory results in the MRI reconstruction. In this study, we propose a new deep learning-based CS-MRI reconstruction method to fully utilise the relationship among sequential MRI slices by coupling Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN) with Recurrent Neural Networks. Further development of an attentive unit enables our model to reconstruct more accurate anatomical structures for the MRI data. By experimenting on different MRI datasets, we have demonstrated that our method can not only achieve better results compared to the state-of-the-arts but can also effectively reduce residual noise generated during the reconstruction process."

We first show that Palatini CS gravity leads to first-order derivative equations of motion and thus avoid the typical instabilities of CS gravity in the metric formalism. As an initial application, we analyze the cosmological propagation of gravitational waves (GWs) in Palatini CS gravity. We show that, due to parity breaking, the polarizations of GWs suffer two effects during propagation: amplitude birefringence (which changes the polarization ellipticity) and velocity birefringence (which rotates the polarization plane). While amplitude birefringence is known to be present in CS gravity in the metric formalism, velocity birefringence is not present in metric CS gravity, but now appears in Palatini CS due to the fact that left-handed and right-handed GW polarizations have a different dispersion relation. In the approximation of small deviations from General Relativity (GR), we do find however that velocity birefringence appears at least quadratically in the CS coupling parameter , while amplitude birefringence appears linearly in . This means that amplitude birefringence will be the most relevant effect in Palatini CS and hence this model will behave similarly to metric CS. We confirm this by applying current constraints on amplitude and velocity birefringence to Palatini CS, and showing that those from amplitude birefringence give the tightest bounds."

Given the increasing discussions of ethics in the news and among researchers, we interviewed 20 researchers in various CS sub-disciplines to identify whether and how they consider potential unintended consequences of their research innovations. We show that considering unintended consequences is generally seen as important but rarely practiced. Principal barriers are a lack of formal process and strategy as well as the academic practice that prioritizes fast progress and publications. Drawing on these findings, we discuss approaches to support researchers in routinely considering unintended consequences, from bringing diverse perspectives through community participation to increasing incentives to investigate potential consequences. We intend for our work to pave the way for routine explorations of the societal implications of technological innovations before, during, and after the research process."

In this paper we study the so-called blind calibration, i.e. when the training signals that are available to perform the calibration are sparse but unknown. We extend the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm used in CS to the case of blind calibration. In the calibration-AMP, both the gains on the sensors and the elements of the signals are treated as unknowns. Our algorithm is also applica- ble to settings in which the sensors distort the measurements in other ways than multiplication by a gain, unlike previously suggested blind calibration algorithms based on convex relaxations. We study numerically the phase diagram of the blind calibration problem, and show that even in cases where convex relaxation is pos- sible, our algorithm requires a smaller number of measurements and/or signals in order to perform well."

CS executes all cryptographic operations in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), upon E's requests. CS and E together provide the whole TLS-server functionality. A major benefit of our construction is that it is application agnostic; the LURK-T Crypto Service could be collocated with the LURK-T Engine, or it could run on different machines. Thus, our design allows for in situ attestation and protection of the cryptographic side of the TLS server, as well as for all setups of CDNs over TLS. To support such a generic decoupling, we provide a full Application Programming Interface (API) for LURK-T. To this end, we implement our LURK-T Crypto Service using Intel SGX and integrate it with OpenSSL. We also test LURK-T's efficiency and show that, from a TLS-client's perspective, HTTPS servers using LURK-T instead a traditional TLS-server have no noticeable overhead when serving files greater than 1MB. In addition, we provide cryptographic proofs and formal security verification using ProVerif."

    "title": "Performance Bounds For Co-/Sparse Box Constrained Signal Recovery",
    "summary": "The recovery of structured signals from a few linear measurements is a central point in both compressed sensing (CS) and discrete tomography. In CS the signal structure is described by means of a low complexity model e.g. co-/sparsity. The CS theory shows that any signal/image can be undersampled at a rate dependent on its intrinsic complexity. Moreover, in such undersampling regimes, the signal can be recovered by sparsity promoting convex regularization like - or total variation (TV-) minimization. Precise relations between many low complexity measures and the sufficient number of random measurements are known for many sparsity promoting norms. However, a precise estimate of the undersampling rate for the TV seminorm is still lacking. We address this issue by: a) providing dual certificates testing uniqueness of a given cosparse signal with bounded signal values, b) approximating the undersampling rates via the statistical dimension of the TV descent cone and c) showing empirically that the provided rates also hold for tomographic measurements."

In this paper, we propose a novel two-branch hierarchical model for short-form video humor detection (SVHD), named Comment-aided Video-Language Alignment (CVLA) via data-augmented multi-modal contrastive pre-training. Notably, our CVLA not only operates on raw signals across various modal channels but also yields an appropriate multi-modal representation by aligning the video and language components within a consistent semantic space.

This integration significantly simplifies the software implementation for the lowcomplexity encoder, thanks to the modular structure of ADMM. Furthermore, we focus on detecting fall down actions from image streams. Thus, teh primary purpose of thus study is to reconstruct the image as visibly clear as possible and hence it helps the detection step at the trained classifier. For this efficient smart health monitoring framework, we employ the trained binary convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier for the fall-action classifier, because this scheme is a part of surveillance scenario. In this scenario, we deal with the fallimages, thus, we compress, transmit and reconstruct the fallimages. Experimental results demonstrate the impacts of network parameters and the significant performance gain of the proposal compared to traditional methods."

    "title": "Subjective Question Answering: Deciphering the inner workings of Transformers in the realm of subjectivity",
    "summary": "Understanding subjectivity demands reasoning skills beyond the realm of common knowledge. It requires a machine learning model to process sentiment and to perform opinion mining. In this work, I've exploited a recently released dataset for span-selection Question Answering, namely SubjQA. SubjQA is the first QA dataset that contains questions that ask for subjective opinions corresponding to review paragraphs from six different domains. Hence, to answer these subjective questions, a learner must extract opinions and process sentiment for various domains, and additionally, align the knowledge extracted from a paragraph with the natural language utterances in the corresponding question, which together enhance the difficulty of a QA task. The primary goal of this thesis was to investigate the inner workings (i.e., latent representations) of a Transformer-based architecture to contribute to a better understanding of these not yet well understood \"black-box\" models. Transformer's hidden representations, concerning the true answer span, are clustered more closely in vector space than those representations corresponding to erroneous predictions. This observation holds across the top three Transformer layers for both objective and subjective questions and generally increases as a function of layer dimensions. Moreover, the probability to achieve a high cosine similarity among hidden representations in latent space concerning the true answer span tokens is significantly higher for correct compared to incorrect answer span predictions. These results have decisive implications for down-stream applications, where it is crucial to know about why a neural network made mistakes, and in which point, in space and time the mistake has happened (e.g., to automatically predict correctness of an answer span prediction without the necessity of labeled data)."

However, the existing deep network-based CS schemes either reconstruct the target image in a block-by-block manner that leads to serious block artifacts or train the deep network as a black box that brings about limited insights of image prior knowledge. In this paper, a novel image CS framework using non-local neural network (NL-CSNet) is proposed, which utilizes the non-local self-similarity priors with deep network to improve the reconstruction quality. In the proposed NL-CSNet, two non-local subnetworks are constructed for utilizing the non-local self-similarity priors in the measurement domain and the multi-scale feature domain respectively. Specifically, in the subnetwork of measurement domain, the long-distance dependencies between the measurements of different image blocks are established for better initial reconstruction. Analogically, in the subnetwork of multi-scale feature domain, the affinities between the dense feature representations are explored in the multi-scale space for deep reconstruction. Furthermore, a novel loss function is developed to enhance the coupling between the non-local representations, which also enables an end-to-end training of NL-CSNet. Extensive experiments manifest that NL-CSNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art CS methods, while maintaining fast computational speed."

However, such a transmission is hindered by excessive feedback overhead. In this letter, we use deep learning technology to develop CsiNet, a novel CSI sensing and recovery mechanism that learns to effectively use channel structure from training samples. CsiNet learns a transformation from CSI to a near-optimal number of representations (or codewords) and an inverse transformation from codewords to CSI. We perform experiments to demonstrate that CsiNet can recover CSI with significantly improved reconstruction quality compared with existing compressive sensing (CS)-based methods. Even at excessively low compression regions where CS-based methods cannot work, CsiNet retains effective beamforming gain."

    "title": "Multi-Resolution Compressed Sensing via Approximate Message Passing",
    "summary": "In this paper, we consider the problem of multi-resolution compressed sensing (MR-CS) reconstruction, which has received little attention in the literature. Instead of always reconstructing the signal at the original high resolution (HR), we enable the reconstruction of a low-resolution (LR) signal when there are not enough CS samples to recover a HR signal. We propose an approximate message passing (AMP)-based framework dubbed MR-AMP, and derive its state evolution, phase transition, and noise sensitivity, which show that in addition to reduced complexity, our method can recover a LR signal with bounded noise sensitivity even when the noise sensitivity of the conventional HR reconstruction is unbounded. We then apply the MR-AMP to image reconstruction using either soft-thresholding or total variation denoiser, and develop three pairs of up-/down-sampling operators in transform or spatial domain. The performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by both 1D synthetic data and 2D images."

    "title": "MOSAIC: Masked Optimisation with Selective Attention for Image Reconstruction",
    "summary": "Compressive sensing (CS) reconstructs images from sub-Nyquist measurements by solving a sparsity-regularized inverse problem. Traditional CS solvers use iterative optimizers with hand crafted sparsifiers, while early data-driven methods directly learn an inverse mapping from the low-dimensional measurement space to the original image space. The latter outperforms the former, but is restrictive to a pre-defined measurement domain. More recent, deep unrolling methods combine traditional proximal gradient methods and data-driven approaches to iteratively refine an image approximation. To achieve higher accuracy, it has also been suggested to learn both the sampling matrix, and the choice of measurement vectors adaptively. Contrary to the current trend, in this work we hypothesize that a general inverse mapping from a random set of compressed measurements to the image domain exists for a given measurement basis, and can be learned. Such a model is single-shot, non-restrictive and does not parametrize the sampling process. To this end, we propose MOSAIC, a novel compressive sensing framework to reconstruct images given any random selection of measurements, sampled using a fixed basis. Motivated by the uneven distribution of information across measurements, MOSAIC incorporates an embedding technique to efficiently apply attention mechanisms on an encoded sequence of measurements, while dispensing the need to use unrolled deep networks. A range of experiments validate our proposed architecture as a promising alternative for existing CS reconstruction methods, by achieving the state-of-the-art for metrics of reconstruction accuracy on standard datasets."

Introductory computing theory can be challenging for undergraduate students, and the main goal of our research is to help students learn these computational models. The most common pedagogical tool for interacting with these models is the Java Formal Languages and Automata Package (JFLAP). We developed a JFLAP server extension, which accepts homework submissions from students, evaluates the submission as correct or incorrect, and provides a witness string when the submission is incorrect. Our extension currently provides witness feedback for deterministic finite automata, nondeterministic finite automata, regular expressions, context-free grammars, and pushdown automata. In Fall 2019, we ran a preliminary investigation on two sections (Control and Study) of the required undergraduate course Introduction to Computer Science Theory. The Study section used our extension for five targeted homework questions, and the Control section solved and submitted these problems using traditional means. Our results show that on these five questions, the Study section performed better on average than the Control section. Moreover, the Study section persisted in submitting attempts until correct, and from this finding, our preliminary conclusion is that minimal (not detailed or grade-based) witness feedback helps students to truly learn the concepts. We describe the results that support this conclusion as well as a related hypothesis conjecturing that with witness feedback and unlimited number of submissions, partial credit is both unnecessary and ineffective."

Using approximate representation can significantly reduce the required storage and search space. A good choice of representation, can support a broad new class of approximate queries, needed in these domains.

    "title": "Refined analysis of sparse MIMO radar",
    "summary": "We analyze a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar model and provide recovery results for a compressed sensing (CS) approach. In MIMO radar different pulses are emitted by several transmitters and the echoes are recorded at several receiver nodes. Under reasonable assumptions the transformation from emitted pulses to the received echoes can approximately be regarded as linear. For the considered model, and many radar tasks in general, sparsity of targets within the considered angle-range-Doppler domain is a natural assumption. Therefore, it is possible to apply methods from CS in order to reconstruct the parameters of the targets. Assuming Gaussian random pulses the resulting measurement matrix becomes a highly structured random matrix. Our first main result provides an estimate for the well-known restricted isometry property (RIP) ensuring stable and robust recovery. We require more measurements than standard results from CS, like for example those for Gaussian random measurements. Nevertheless, we show that due to the special structure of the considered measurement matrix our RIP result is in fact optimal (up to possibly logarithmic factors). Our further two main results on nonuniform recovery (i.e., for a fixed sparse target scene) reveal how the fine structure of the support set affects the (nonuniform) recovery performance. We show that for certain \"balanced\" support sets reconstruction with essentially the optimal number of measurements is possible. We prove recovery results for both perfect recovery of the support set in case of exactly sparse vectors and an -norm approximation result for reconstruction under sparsity defect.Our analysis complements earlier work by Strohmer & Friedlander and deepens the understanding of the considered MIMO radar model."

However, some applications have a limited degree of parallelism such that no matter how efficient the RS implementation, they may not scale on modern multicore CPUs. In this paper, we propose using speculation to unleash the parallelism when it is uncertain if some tasks will modify data, and we formalize a new methodology to enable speculative execution in a graph of tasks. This description is partially implemented in our new C++ RS called SPETABARU, which is capable of executing tasks in advance if some others are not certain to modify the data.

As an example, we consider demodulation of pulse position modulation (PPM) signals. The results indicate that the proposed method has much better performance than the random measurements and requires less samples than the optimum matched filter demodulator, at the expense of some performance loss. Further, the proposed approach does not need equalizer for multipath channels in contrast to the conventional receiver."

But the electromagnetic energy remains unchanged everywhere. Based on the de-centered monopole solution generated by symmetry in flat spacetime, we construct two generalized split monopole configurations, in which the field lines intersect with the CS at arbitrary angles. One configuration resembles the outer geometry of the so-called ``new pulsar magnetosphere model\", for which up to of the spin down energy is transferred to the Joule heating process in the CS. In the other configuration, we observe that negative energy is dissipated in the CS, which is usually observed in magnetospheres on rotating black holes. This means that energy is extracted simultaneously from the central star and the CS to power the output Poynting flux at infinity. We interpret the extraction of energy from the CS as that thermal energy of charged particles in the CS is transferred to the ordered kinetic energy of these particles drifting in the force-free (FF) electromagnetic fields. Hence, the CS is like an ``air conditioner\" in the sky, which can heat up or cool down, depending on the configurations."

Numerical calculations show that the eastbound Sagnac interferometer might be preferred for testing CS separately, because LT effects on this interferometer cancel out. The size of the phase shift induced in the CS model might have an oscillatory dependence also on the altitude of the interferometer through the CS mass parameter . Therefore, the international space station site as well as a ground-based experiment is also discussed."

In the training phase, all parameters of the nets, e.g., transforms, shrinkage functions, etc., are discriminatively trained end-to-end. In the testing phase, they have computational overhead similar to ADMM algorithm but use optimized parameters learned from the data for CS-based reconstruction task. We investigate different configurations in network structures and conduct extensive experiments on MR image reconstruction under different sampling rates. Due to the combination of the advantages in model-based approach and deep learning approach, the ADMM-Nets achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracies with fast computational speed."

Most of matrices used in CS are random matrices as they satisfy the restricted isometry property (RIP) in an optimal regime of number of measurements with high probability. However, these matrices have their own caveats and for this reason, deterministic measurement matrices have been proposed. While there is a wide classes of deterministic matrices in the literature, we propose a novel class of deterministic matrices using the Legendre symbol. This construction has a simple structure, it enjoys being a binary matrix, and having a partial circulant structure which provides a fast matrix-vector multiplication and a fast reconstruction algorithm. We will derive a bound on the sparsity level of signals that can be measured (and be reconstructed) with this class of matrices. We perform quantization using these matrices, and we verify the performance of these matrices (and compare with other existing constructions) numerically."

On the other hand, the beam squint effect caused by huge bandwidth and massive antennas will deteriorate estimation performance. In this paper, frequency-dependent angular dictionaries are first adopted to compensate for beam squint. Then, the expectation-maximization (EM)-based sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm is enhanced in two aspects, where the E-step in each iteration is implemented by approximate message passing (AMP) to reduce complexity while the M-step is realized by a deep neural network (DNN) to improve performance. In simulation, the proposed AMP-SBL unfolding-based channel estimator achieves satisfactory performance with low complexity."

In this paper, we propose and study three frameworks for Compressive Sensing (CS) in SHM systems; these methods are intended to minimize power consumption by allowing the data to be sampled and/or transmitted more efficiently. At the central node, all of these frameworks involve a very simple technique for estimating the structure's mode shapes without requiring a traditional CS reconstruction of the vibration signals; all that is needed is to compute a simple Singular Value Decomposition. We provide theoretical justification (including measurement bounds) for each of these techniques based on the equations of motion describing a simplified Multiple-Degree-Of-Freedom (MDOF) system, and we support our proposed techniques using simulations based on synthetic and real data."

Associated with a deterministic encoder there are two RICs, namely, the left and the right RIC.

We derive the probability and the cumulative distribution functions of these RIVs for the most widely used i.i.d. Gaussian encoders. We also derive the asymptotic distributions of the RIVs and show that the distribution of the left RIV converges (in distribution) to the Weibull distribution, whereas that of the right RIV converges to the Gumbel distribution. By adopting the RIV framework, we bring to forefront that the current practice of using eigenvalues for RIC prediction can be improved. We show on the one hand that the eigenvalue-based approaches tend to overestimate the RICs. On the other hand, the RIV-based analysis yields precise estimates of the RICs. We also demonstrate that this precise estimation aids to improve the previous RIC-based phase transition analysis in CS."

However, the detailed physical properties and fine structures of the CS are still unknown since there is no relevant information obtained via in situ detections. The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) may provide us such information should it traverse a CS in the eruption. The perihelion of PSP's final orbit is located at about 10 solar radii from the center of the Sun, so it can observe the CS at a very close distance, or even traverses the CS, which provides us a unique opportunity to look into fine properties and structures of the CS, helping reveal the detailed physics of large-scale reconnection that was impossible before. We evaluate the probability that PSP can traverse a CS, and examine the orbit of a PSP-like spacecraft that has the highest probability to traverse a CS."

The choice of a sensing matrix that carries out the measurement has a defining impact on the system performance and it is often advocated to draw its elements randomly. It has been noted that in the presence of input (signal) noise, the application of the sensing matrix causes SNR degradation due to the noise folding effect. In fact, it might also result in the variations of the output SNR in compressive measurements over the support of the input signal, potentially resulting in unexpected non-uniform system performance. In this work, we study the impact of a distribution from which the elements of a sensing matrix are drawn on the spread of the output SNR. We derive analytic expressions for several common types of sensing matrices and show that the SNR spread grows with the decrease of the number of measurements. This makes its negative effect especially pronounced for high compression rates that are often of interest in CS."

A nonlocal non-LTE radiative transfer code including dust and cosmic background illumination adapted to the Horsehead geometry has been developed to carefuly analyse the CS, C34S, HCS+ and C18O rotational line emission. We use this model to consistently link the line observations with photochemical models to determine the CS/HCS+/S/S+ structure of the PDR. The combination of CS, C34S and HCS+ observations together with the inclusion of the most recent CS collisional and chemical rates in our models implies that sulfur depletion invoked to account for CS and HCS+ abundances is much smaller than in previous studies."

    "summary": "Lexical normalization, the translation of non-canonical data to standard language, has shown to improve the performance of manynatural language processing tasks on social media. Yet, using multiple languages in one utterance, also called code-switching (CS), is frequently overlooked by these normalization systems, despite its common use in social media. In this paper, we propose three normalization models specifically designed to handle code-switched data which we evaluate for two language pairs: Indonesian-English (Id-En) and Turkish-German (Tr-De). For the latter, we introduce novel normalization layers and their corresponding language ID and POS tags for the dataset, and evaluate the downstream effect of normalization on POS tagging. Results show that our CS-tailored normalization models outperform Id-En state of the art and Tr-De monolingual models, and lead to 5.4% relative performance increase for POS tagging as compared to unnormalized input."

Specifically, the model updates for all the tasks are transmitted and superimposed concurrently over a non-orthogonal uplink fading channel, and the model aggregations of all the tasks are reconstructed at the ES through a modified version of the turbo compressed sensing algorithm (Turbo-CS) that overcomes inter-task interference. Both convergence analysis and numerical results show that the OA-FMTL framework can significantly improve the system efficiency in terms of reducing the number of channel uses without causing substantial learning performance degradation."

A unified framework is introduced for low rate sampling and processing of signals lying in a union of subspaces. Xampling consists of two main blocks: Analog compression that narrows down the input bandwidth prior to sampling with commercial devices followed by a nonlinear algorithm that detects the input subspace prior to conventional signal processing. A variety of analog CS applications are reviewed within the unified Xampling framework including a general filter-bank scheme for sparse shift-invariant spaces, periodic nonuniform sampling and modulated wideband conversion for multiband communications with unknown carrier frequencies, acquisition techniques for finite rate of innovation signals with applications to medical and radar imaging, and random demodulation of sparse harmonic tones. A hardware-oriented viewpoint is advocated throughout, addressing practical constraints and exemplifying hardware realizations where relevant. It will appear as a chapter in a book on \"Compressed Sensing: Theory and Applications\" edited by Yonina Eldar and Gitta Kutyniok."

However, the problem of constructing CS has still not been investigated in detail for the simplest and physically important case of a free particle, for which, besides being physically important, the CS problem is of didactic value in teaching quantum mechanics, with the CS regarded as examples of wave packets representing semiclassical motion. In this paper, we essentially follow the Malkin-Dodonov-Man'ko method to construct the CS of a free nonrelativistic particle. We give a detailed discussion of the properties of the CS obtained, in particular, the completeness relations, the minimization of uncertainty relations, and the evolution of the corresponding probability density. We describe the physical conditions under which free-particle CS can be considered semiclassical states."

    "title": "QFP Waves Driven by the Tuning-Fork Effect during Magnetic Reconnecion",
    "summary": "Through three-dimensional MHD simulations, we have uncovered a kind of fast coronal wave originating from both ends of a current sheet (CS) during a solar eruption. These waves are observed to appear near the top and bottom ends of the reconnection-related CS. The simulations demonstrate the presence of termination shock regions above the two ends of the CS. As the reconnection outflows escape from the vertical CS and encounter these termination shocks, they undergo partial reflection, redirecting towards the CS terminal fork walls. The identified waves propagate rapidly at a speed of approximately 1400 km/s with a period of just 2 s. Concurrently, the time-evolution of intensity within a small region of the CS terminal fork structures, exhibits a similar oscillation period of 2 s. All these evidence supports the notion that these QFP (Quasi-periodic Fast-Propagating) waves were excited by tuning fork effects within the CS system. Essentially, the rapid reconnection outflows are reflected by the terminal shocks, striking the fork walls at the CS ends. Moreover, parts of the oscillations along the tuning fork handle are transformed into thermal energy, accumulating in the CS center and elevating the temperature. This is the first time to report such QFP waves resulting from tuning fork effects within the CS during a solar eruption. These waves are anticipated to manifest closely following the propagation of CMEs and adjacent to the related post-flare loops in observations, with partial confirmation in current observations."

    "summary": "Recently, the sparse vector code (SVC) is emerging as a promising solution for short-packet transmission in massive machine type communication (mMTC) as well as ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC). In the SVC process, the encoding and decoding stages are jointly modeled as a standard compressed sensing (CS) problem. Hence, this paper aims at improving the decoding performance of SVC by optimizing the spreading matrix (i.e. measurement matrix in CS). To this end, two greedy algorithms to minimize the mutual coherence value of the spreading matrix in SVC are proposed. Specially, for practical applications, the spreading matrices are further required to be bipolar whose entries are constrained as +1 or -1. As a result, the optimized spreading matrices are highly efficient for storage, computation, and hardware realization. Simulation results reveal that, compared with the existing work, the block error rate (BLER) performance of SVC can be improved significantly with the optimized spreading matrices."

    "summary": "To capture the relationship between samples and labels, conditional generative models often inherit spurious correlations from the training dataset. This can result in label-conditional distributions that are imbalanced with respect to another latent attribute. To mitigate this issue, which we call spurious causality of conditional generation, we propose a general two-step strategy. (a) Fairness Intervention (FI): emphasize the minority samples that are hard to generate due to the spurious correlation in the training dataset. (b) Corrective Sampling (CS): explicitly filter the generated samples and ensure that they follow the desired latent attribute distribution. We have designed the fairness intervention to work for various degrees of supervision on the spurious attribute, including unsupervised, weakly-supervised, and semi-supervised scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate that FICS can effectively resolve spurious causality of conditional generation across various datasets."

Investigating the gas-phase molecules in PPNe could yield important hints for understanding the 21 m feature. In this paper, we report observations of the CS line at 245 GHz and the CO line at 115 GHz toward seven PPNe exhibiting the 21 m feature. We find that CS is extremely scarce in these PPNe and the CS line is only detected in one source, IRAS Z02229+6208. Based on the assumption of local thermal equilibrium and negligible optical depth, we derive that the CS column densities and fractional abundances relative to H are (CS) < 9.1 10 cm and (CS) < 8.1 10 . A comparison of the CS abundances across different circumstellar envelopes reveals that the variations in CS abundance are complex, depending not only on the evolutionary stages but also on the properties of individual objects."

In this paper, we show that it does admit rotating black hole/string solutions with cylindrical topology of the horizon and present two intriguing physical examples of such configurations. First, we show that the Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) stationary black string, that is obtained by adding on a spacelike flat dimension to the BTZ black hole metric of three-dimensional gravity, solves the field equations of CS modified gravity with a specific source term and irrespective of the choice of CS scalar field . Next, we consider the Lemos solution for a rotating straight black string in general relativity and show that for the CS scalar field being a function of the radial coordinate alone, this solution persists in CS modified gravity. We also discuss two examples of Gödel type metrics in CS modified gravity by uplifting to four dimensions a general one-parameter family of Gödel type solutions of three-dimensional gravity. The first example is the usual Gödel solution of general relativity which also survives in CS modified gravity with the CS scalar field depending on two variables, the radial and the azimuthal coordinates. The second example represents a new nontrivial (non general relativity) Gödel type solution to the vacuum field equations of CS modified gravity. This solution originates from the respective vacuum solution of topologically massive gravity when extending it to four dimensions by adding on an extra spatial coordinate and choosing the CS scalar field as a linear function of this coordinate."

    "summary": "A blind spot is any input to a program that can be arbitrarily mutated without affecting the program's output. Blind spots can be used for steganography or to embed malware payloads. If blind spots overlap file format keywords, they indicate parsing bugs that can lead to exploitable differentials. For example, one could craft a document that renders one way in one viewer and a completely different way in another viewer. They have also been used to circumvent code signing in Android binaries, to coerce certificate authorities to misbehave, and to execute HTTP request smuggling and parameter pollution attacks. This paper formalizes the operational semantics of blind spots, leading to a technique based on dynamic information flow tracking that automatically detects blind spots. An efficient implementation is introduced and evaluated against a corpus of over a thousand diverse PDFs parsed through MuPDF, revealing exploitable bugs in the parser. All of the blind spot classifications are confirmed to be correct and the missed detection rate is no higher than 11%. On average, at least 5% of each PDF file is completely ignored by the parser. Our results show promise that this technique is an efficient automated means to detect exploitable parser bugs, over-permissiveness and differentials. Nothing in the technique is tied to PDF in general, so it can be immediately applied to other notoriously difficult-to-parse formats like ELF, X.509, and XML."

However, while there are several potential applications of channel simulation - lossy compression with realism constraints or differential privacy, to name a few - little is known about its fundamental limitations. In this paper, we restrict our attention to a subclass of channel simulation protocols called causal rejection samplers (CRS), establish new, tighter lower bounds on their expected runtime and codelength, and demonstrate the bounds' achievability. Concretely, for an arbitrary CRS, let and denote a target and proposal distribution supplied as input, and let be the number of samples examined by the algorithm. We show that the expected runtime of any CRS scales at least as , where is the Rényi -divergence. Regarding the codelength, we show that , where is a new quantity we call the channel simulation divergence. Furthermore, we prove that our new lower bound, unlike the lower bound, is achievable tightly, i.e. there is a CRS such that . Finally, we conduct numerical studies of the asymptotic scaling of the codelength of Gaussian and Laplace channel simulation algorithms."

Deep clustering utilizes deep neural networks to learn latent representation, which is suitable for clustering. However, previous deep clustering methods, especially image clustering, focus on the features of the data itself and ignore the relationship between the data, which is crucial for clustering. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Structure and Attention aware Subspace Clustering (DSASC), which simultaneously considers data content and structure information. We use a vision transformer to extract features, and the extracted features are divided into two parts, structure features, and content features. The two features are used to learn a more efficient subspace structure for spectral clustering. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/cs-whh/DSASC"

A model fit of the observed bolometric light curve combined with data on the supernova expansion velocity provides an estimate of the density of the CS shell, its mass ( ), and age ( years). It is shown that the derived CS gas density does not depend on the assumed mass of the supernova ejecta. This results from the high CS density, which ensures that the forward shock wave is essentially radiative. The derived CS density is consistent with the H luminosity and with the presence of the apparent effect of Thomson scattering in the red wing of this line. The mass of the CS envelope together with its expansion velocity indicates that the CS envelope was ejected as a result of violent energy release ( erg) eight years before the supernova outburst."

This raises two research questions: (i) what is a good notion of \"rule\" in this context?; and (ii) how can sets of rules explaining a data set be learned algorithmically? We explore these questions from the perspective of database theory by (1) introducing a pattern-based specification language for tree transformations; (2) exploring the computational complexity of variants of the above algorithmic problem, e.g. showing NP-hardness for very restricted variants; and (3) discussing how to solve the problem for data from CS education research using SAT solvers."

FreqRank assumes that the malicious sub-string(s) consistently appear in outputs for triggered inputs and uses a frequency-based ranking system to identify them. Our ranking system then leverages this knowledge to localize the backdoor triggers present in the inputs. We create nine malicious models through fine-tuning or custom instructions for three downstream tasks, namely, code completion (CC), code generation (CG), and code summarization (CS), and show that they have an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86.6%. Furthermore, FreqRank's ranking system highlights the malicious outputs as one of the top five suggestions in 98% of cases. We also demonstrate that FreqRank's effectiveness scales as the number of mutants increases and show that FreqRank is capable of localizing the backdoor trigger effectively even with a limited number of triggered samples. Finally, we show that our approach is 35-50% more effective than other defense methods."

While the compressive sensing is performed globally on the entire image as implemented in our lensless camera, a low-rank GMM is imposed on the local image patches. This low-rank GMM is derived via eigenvalue thresholding of the GMM trained on the projection of the measurement data, thus learned in situ . The GMM and the projection of the measurement data are updated iteratively during the reconstruction. Our GMM algorithm degrades to the piecewise linear estimator (PLE) if each patch is represented by a single Gaussian model. Inspired by this, a low-rank PLE algorithm is also developed for CS inversion, constituting an additional contribution of this paper. Extensive results on both simulation data and real data captured by the lensless camera demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, we compare the CS reconstruction results using our algorithm with the JPEG compression. Simulation results demonstrate that when limited bandwidth is available (a small number of measurements), our algorithm can achieve comparable results as JPEG."

In the HPNC scheme, both sources first transmit the correlated raw source messages to the relay simultaneously. The relay performs physical-layer network coding (PNC) on the received symbols, compresses the PNC-coded symbols using Huffman coding, and broadcasts the compressed symbols to both source nodes. Then, each source decodes the other source's messages by using its own messages as side information. Compression rate and block error rate (BLER) of the proposed scheme are analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate that the HPNC scheme can effectively improve the network throughput, and meanwhile, achieve the superior BLER performance compared with the conventional non-compressed relaying scheme in TWRN-CS."

We propose AdaSense, a novel Adaptive CS approach that leverages zero-shot posterior sampling with pre-trained diffusion models. By sequentially sampling from the posterior distribution, we can quantify the uncertainty of each possible future linear measurement throughout the acquisition process. AdaSense eliminates the need for additional training and boasts seamless adaptation to diverse domains with minimal tuning requirements. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaSense in reconstructing facial images from a small number of measurements. Furthermore, we apply AdaSense for active acquisition of medical images in the domains of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), highlighting its potential for tangible real-world acceleration."

The main idea is based on the fact that the AB solenoid breaks the translational symmetry in the xy-plane, this has a topological effect such that there appear two types of trajectories which embrace and do not embrace the solenoid. Due to this fact, one has to construct two different kinds of CS/SS, which correspond to such trajectories in the semiclassical limit. Following this idea, we construct CS in two steps, first the instantaneous CS (ICS) and the time dependent CS/SS as an evolution of the ICS. The construction is realized for nonrelativistic and relativistic spinning particles both in (2+1)- and (3+1)- dimensions and gives a non-trivial example of SS/CS for systems with a nonquadratic Hamiltonian. It is stressed that CS depending on their parameters (quantum numbers) describe both pure quantum and semiclassical states. An analysis is represented that classifies parameters of the CS in such respect. Such a classification is used for the semiclassical decompositions of various physical quantities."

More precisely, we make use of the merits of both wavelet transform and the adaptive iteration strategy in a unified framework.

Existing statistical element selection (SES) design method can improve transistor matching property, but it falls short of being a general calibration method due to its limited calibration range. In this dissertation, we propose a high resolution digital calibration method, called extended statistical element selection (ESES). As compared to the SES method, the ESES method not only provides wider calibration range, but also it results in higher calibration yield with same calibration resolution target. Two types of ESES based calibration application in analog/RF circuits are also proposed. One is current source calibration and the other is phase/delay calibration. To verify this proposed digital calibration method in circuit implementation, we designed, fabricated and tested a wideband harmonic rejection receiver design. The receiver utilizes ESES-based gain and phase error calibration for improving harmonic rejection ratios. With the high calibration resolution provided by the ESES method, after calibration, we achieved best-in-class harmonic rejection ratios. To extend the application of the proposed method, we further designed a current-steering D/A data converter (CS-DAC). The CS-DAC utilizes ESES-based amplitude and timing error calibration for improving linearity performance. Simulation results showed that we can achieve more than one order of magnitude linearity improvement after performing ESES-based calibration in the CS-DAC."

    "summary": "In phase-only compressive sensing (PO-CS), our goal is to recover low-complexity signals (e.g., sparse signals, low-rank matrices) from the phase of complex linear measurements. While perfect recovery of signal direction in PO-CS was observed quite early, the exact reconstruction guarantee for a fixed, real signal was recently done by Jacques and Feuillen [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 67 (2021), pp. 4150-4161]. However, two questions remain open: the uniform recovery guarantee and exact recovery of complex signal. In this paper, we almost completely address these two open questions. We prove that, all complex sparse signals or low-rank matrices can be uniformly, exactly recovered from a near optimal number of complex Gaussian measurement phases. By recasting PO-CS as a linear compressive sensing problem, the exact recovery follows from restricted isometry property (RIP). Our approach to uniform recovery guarantee is based on covering arguments that involve a delicate control of the (original linear) measurements with overly small magnitude. To work with complex signal, a different sign-product embedding property and a careful rescaling of the sensing matrix are employed. In addition, we show an extension that the uniform recovery is stable under moderate bounded noise. We also propose to add Gaussian dither before capturing the phases to achieve full reconstruction with norm information. Experimental results are reported to corroborate and demonstrate our theoretical results."

This enables LLMs to adapt to specific domains and mitigate hallucinations in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing retrievers are often misaligned with LLMs due to their separate training processes and the black-box nature of LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose ARL2, a retriever learning technique that harnesses LLMs as labelers. ARL2 leverages LLMs to annotate and score relevant evidence, enabling learning the retriever from robust LLM supervision. Furthermore, ARL2 uses an adaptive self-training strategy for curating high-quality and diverse relevance data, which can effectively reduce the annotation cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ARL2, achieving accuracy improvements of 5.4% on NQ and 4.6% on MMLU compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

After an extensive observational campaign, we updated the prediction and it turned out to be favorable to central Europe. Therefore, we mobilized half a hundred professional and amateur astronomers, and the occultation was finally detected from 21 telescopes located at 18 sites. This makes the Huya event one of the best ever observed stellar occultation by a TNO in terms of the number of chords. We determine accurate size, shape, and geometric albedo, and we also provide constraints on the density and other internal properties of this TNO. The 21 positive detections of the occultation by Huya allowed us to obtain well-separated chords which permitted us to fit an ellipse for the limb of the body at the moment of the occultation (i.e., the instantaneous limb) with kilometric accuracy. The projected semi-major and minor axes of the best ellipse fit obtained using the occultation data are (a', b') = (217.6 3.5 km, 194.1 6.1 km) with a position angle of the minor axis P' = 55.2 9.1 degrees. From this fit, the projected area-equivalent diameter is 411.0 7.3 km. This diameter is compatible with the equivalent diameter for Huya obtained from radiometric techniques (D = 406 16 km). From this instantaneous limb, we obtained the geometric albedo for Huya (p = 0.079 0.004) and we explored possible 3D shapes and constraints to the mass density for this TNO. We did not detect the satellite of Huya through this occultation, but the presence of rings or debris around Huya is constrained using the occultation data. We also derived an upper limit for a putative Pluto-like global atmosphere of about p = 10 nbar."

    "title": "Tracking the untracked",
    "summary": "The issue of seamless identification of users previously tracked using existing real-time optical position tracking system such as the OptiTrack system and maintaining continuous tracking state (history) of each of those users is a hard problem. In this article, we present a theoretical framework to integrate existing tracking systems with features such as user identification and history of up to `n' person activity. In our approach, we assume no direct communication with the tracking system, but access to all data it collects. Also, there are no guarantees that 1) the order of each tracked retro-reflective sphere reported is the same, and 2) that there will be any particular number of spheres in the room at any given time. We describe how the data is fused with existing tracking data to provide a seamless transition between other forms of position tracking."

    "title": "Coherent Structures and Lattice-Boltzmann Hydrodynamics in Turbulent Pipe Flows",
    "summary": "Coherent structures (CS) are known to be part of the foundations of turbulent flow dynamics. For a long time, their appearance was believed to be chaotic and unorganized. However, it has been demonstrated through numerical simulations and experiments that a high degree of organization of CS could be attributed to the constitution of a turbulent state. Understanding these organizational dynamics promises to bring valuable theoretical and applied predictions, such as the average lifetime of turbulent structures and understanding the role of CS in particulate transport. The identification of CS was achieved by selecting the most energetic mode in the flow direction within a specified reference shell. Furthermore, the transition dynamics between the identified CS was investigated as a stochastic process, revealing a non-Markovian effect through an algebraic decay of the temporal self-correlation of the identified CS. Finally, the non-Markovian behavior observed between the transitions of CS was reproduced by a low-level Markovian model, which takes into account the degeneracy effects in the definition of the identified CS. In order to obtain an algorithm capable of simulating the quasi-static regime in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows a multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) model and a distance-dependent boundary condition were introduced for the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) associated with the induction equation for MHD flows. Finally, a turbulent pipe flow simulation was performed by the LBM with a MRT model for hydrodynamic distributions. The identification of CS revealed a non-trivial memory effect with respect to the force that triggered the turbulent state. The transition dynamics of CS revealed a Markovian behavior for finely resolved time data, indicating that experimental behavior could be recovered for larger time separations and, consequently, a larger dataset."

    "title": "Redefining Ultrasound Compounding: Computational Sonography",
    "summary": "Freehand three-dimensional ultrasound (3D-US) has gained considerable interest in research, but even today suffers from its high inter-operator variability in clinical practice. The high variability mainly arises from tracking inaccuracies as well as the directionality of the ultrasound data, being neglected in most of today's reconstruction methods. By providing a novel paradigm for the acquisition and reconstruction of tracked freehand 3D ultrasound, this work presents the concept of Computational Sonography (CS) to model the directionality of ultrasound information. CS preserves the directionality of the acquired data, and allows for its exploitation by computational algorithms. In this regard, we propose a set of mathematical models to represent 3D-US data, inspired by the physics of ultrasound imaging. We compare different models of Computational Sonography to classical scalar compounding for freehand acquisitions, providing both an improved preservation of US directionality as well as improved image quality in 3D. The novel concept is evaluated for a set of phantom datasets, as well as for in-vivo acquisitions of muscoloskeletal and vascular applications."

Additionally, we introduce two publicly available datasets of annotated images to the community. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in macro images (Pinus taeda and Gleditsia triacanthos) while showing slightly lower performance in microscopy images of Salix glauca. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that studies automatic tree ring detection for such different species and acquisition conditions.

We provide details of our SCUBA-2 data reduction pipeline, optimised for slightly extended sources, and including a calibration model adjusted to match conventions used in other far-infrared data. We measure total integrated fluxes for the entire JINGLE sample in 10 infrared/submillimetre bands, including all WISE, Herschel-PACS, Herschel-SPIRE and SCUBA-2 850 maps, statistically accounting for the contamination by CO(J=3-2) in the 850 band. Of our initial sample of 193 galaxies, 191 are detected at 250 with a 5 significance. In the SCUBA-2 850 band we detect 126 galaxies with 3 significance. The distribution of the JINGLE galaxies in far-infrared/sub-millimetre colour-colour plots reveals that the sample is not well fit by single modified-blackbody models that assume a single dust-emissivity index . Instead, our new 850 data suggest either that a large fraction of our objects require , or that a model allowing for an excess of sub-mm emission (e.g., a broken dust emissivity law, or a very cold dust component 10 K) is required. We provide relations to convert far-infrared colours to dust temperature and for JINGLE-like galaxies. For JINGLE the FIR colours correlate more strongly with star-formation rate surface-density rather than the stellar surface-density, suggesting heating of dust is greater due to younger rather than older stellar-populations, consistent with the low proportion of early-type galaxies in the sample."

To preserve the stability of CS, CEP slip always equals to the pump phase detuning. When CEP slip fails to follow the pump phase detuning, CS becomes unstable. The locking between CEP slip and pump phase detuning results in a scaling law for CS."

    "title": "Cell Detection in Microscopy Images with Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Compressed Sensing",
    "summary": "The ability to automatically detect certain types of cells or cellular subunits in microscopy images is of significant interest to a wide range of biomedical research and clinical practices. Cell detection methods have evolved from employing hand-crafted features to deep learning-based techniques. The essential idea of these methods is that their cell classifiers or detectors are trained in the pixel space, where the locations of target cells are labeled. In this paper, we seek a different route and propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based cell detection method that uses encoding of the output pixel space. For the cell detection problem, the output space is the sparsely labeled pixel locations indicating cell centers. We employ random projections to encode the output space to a compressed vector of fixed dimension. Then, CNN regresses this compressed vector from the input pixels. Furthermore, it is possible to stably recover sparse cell locations on the output pixel space from the predicted compressed vector using -norm optimization. In the past, output space encoding using compressed sensing (CS) has been used in conjunction with linear and non-linear predictors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful use of CNN with CS-based output space encoding. We made substantial experiments on several benchmark datasets, where the proposed CNN + CS framework (referred to as CNNCS) achieved the highest or at least top-3 performance in terms of F1-score, compared with other state-of-the-art methods."

    "title": "Near-Field Imaging by Exploiting Frequency Correlation in Wireless Communication Networks",
    "summary": "In this work, we address the near-field imaging under a wideband wireless communication network by exploiting both the near-field channel of a uniform linear array (ULA) and the image correlation in the frequency domain. We first formulate the image recovery as a special multiple measurement vector (MMV) compressed sensing (CS) problem, where at various frequencies the sensing matrices can be different, and the image coefficients are correlated. To solve such an MMV problem with various sensing matrices and correlated coefficients, we propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based solution to simultaneously estimate all image coefficients and their correlation on multiple frequencies. Moreover, to enhance estimation performance, we design two illumination patterns following two different criteria. From the CS perspective, the first design minimizes the total coherence of the sensing matrix to increase the mutual orthogonality of the basis vectors. Alternatively, to improve SNR, the second design maximizes the illumination power of the imaging area. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SBL-based method and the superiority of the illumination designs."

These call for compassionate pedagogies and Universal Design For Learning (UDL) to create learning environments and materials where cognitive diversity is welcomed. To address this, we introduce DiverseClaire a pilot study, which simulates students including neurodiverse profiles using LLMs and diverse personas. By leveraging Bloom's Taxonomy and UDL, DiverseClaire compared UDL-transformed lecture slides with traditional formats. To evaluate DiverseClaire controlled experiments, we used the evaluation metric the average score. The findings revealed that the simulated neurodiverse students struggled with learning due to lecture slides that were in inaccessible formats. These results highlight the need to provide course materials in multiple formats for diverse learner preferences. Data from our pilot study will be made available to assist future CS1 instructors."

These specifications within a Hoare type are given in the form of Hoare-logic style pre- and postconditions following the propositions-as-types principle. The type-checking process verifies that the implementation conforms to the provided specification. QHTT has the potential to be a unified system for programming, specifying, and reasoning about quantum programs."

    "summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered how post-secondary students receive their education. Namely, the transition from an in-person to an online class format changed how students interact with their instructors and their classmates. In this paper, we use student participation scores from two core computer science classes across ten in-person and three online quarters at a public research university to analyze whether the shift to primarily asynchronous online learning has impacted the gender gap in student participation scores and students' attitudes towards themselves and their peers. We observe a shift on the online class forum: in in-person classes, males score higher on average and dominate the top scores while in online classes, male and female students participate at approximately the same rate classwide. To understand what might be driving changes in participation behavior, we analyze survey responses from over a quarter of the students enrolled in the online classes. While we find that students of both genders tend to compare themselves to their peers less when classes are online, we also find that this trend is much more accentuated for females than males. This data suggests that observed female participation habits in typical in-person classes are not inherent gender differences, but rather, a product of the environment. Therefore, it is critical the community investigates the root causes of these behavioral differences, and experiments with ways to mitigate them, before we soon return to an in-person format."

    "summary": "In the FAME! project, we aim to develop an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system for Frisian-Dutch code-switching (CS) speech extracted from the archives of a local broadcaster with the ultimate goal of building a spoken document retrieval system. Unlike Dutch, Frisian is a low-resourced language with a very limited amount of manually annotated speech data. In this paper, we describe several automatic annotation approaches to enable using of a large amount of raw bilingual broadcast data for acoustic model training in a semi-supervised setting. Previously, it has been shown that the best-performing ASR system is obtained by two-stage multilingual deep neural network (DNN) training using 11 hours of manually annotated CS speech (reference) data together with speech data from other high-resourced languages. We compare the quality of transcriptions provided by this bilingual ASR system with several other approaches that use a language recognition system for assigning language labels to raw speech segments at the front-end and using monolingual ASR resources for transcription. We further investigate automatic annotation of the speakers appearing in the raw broadcast data by first labeling with (pseudo) speaker tags using a speaker diarization system and then linking to the known speakers appearing in the reference data using a speaker recognition system. These speaker labels are essential for speaker-adaptive training in the proposed setting. We train acoustic models using the manually and automatically annotated data and run recognition experiments on the development and test data of the FAME! speech corpus to quantify the quality of the automatic annotations. The ASR and CS detection results demonstrate the potential of using automatic language and speaker tagging in semi-supervised bilingual acoustic model training."

This is also reflected in the available benchmarks which lack authentic texts in languages other than English and predominantly cover older generators. To fill this gap, we introduce MULTITuDE, a novel benchmarking dataset for multilingual machine-generated text detection comprising of 74,081 authentic and machine-generated texts in 11 languages (ar, ca, cs, de, en, es, nl, pt, ru, uk, and zh) generated by 8 multilingual LLMs. Using this benchmark, we compare the performance of zero-shot (statistical and black-box) and fine-tuned detectors. Considering the multilinguality, we evaluate 1) how these detectors generalize to unseen languages (linguistically similar as well as dissimilar) and unseen LLMs and 2) whether the detectors improve their performance when trained on multiple languages."

    "summary": "The Circular Economy (CE) is regarded as a solution to the environmental crisis. However, mainstream CE measures skirt around challenging the ethos of ever-increasing economic growth, overlooking social impacts and under-representing solutions such as reducing overall consumption. Circular Societies (CS) address these concerns by challenging this ethos. They emphasize ground-up social reorganization,address over-consumption through sufficiency strategies, and highlight the need for considering the complex inter-dependencies between nature, society, and technology on local, regional and global levels. However, no blueprint exists for forming CSs. An initial objective of my thesis is exploring existing social-network ontologies and developing a broadly applicable model for CSs. Since ground-up social reorganization on local, regional, and global levels has compounding effects on network complexities,a technological framework digitizing these inter-dependencies is necessary. Finally, adhering to CS principles of transparency and democratization, a system of trust is necessary to achieve collaborative consensus of the network state."

    "summary": "We study the regulation of algorithmic (non-)collusion amongst sellers in dynamic imperfect price competition by auditing their data as introduced by Hartline et al. [2024]. We develop an auditing method that tests whether a seller's pessimistic calibrated regret is low. The pessimistic calibrated regret is the highest calibrated regret of outcomes compatible with the observed data. This method relaxes the previous requirement that a pricing algorithm must use fully-supported price distributions to be auditable. This method is at least as permissive as any auditing method that has a high probability of failing algorithmic outcomes with non-vanishing calibrated regret. Additionally, we strengthen the justification for using vanishing calibrated regret, versus vanishing best-in-hindsight regret, as the non-collusion definition, by showing that even without any side information, the pricing algorithms that only satisfy weaker vanishing best-in-hindsight regret allow an opponent to manipulate them into posting supra-competitive prices. This manipulation cannot be excluded with a non-collusion definition of vanishing best-in-hindsight regret. We motivate and interpret the approach of auditing algorithms from their data as suggesting a per se rule. However, we demonstrate that it is possible for algorithms to pass the audit by pretending to have higher costs than they actually do. For such scenarios, the rule of reason can be applied to bound the range of costs to those that are reasonable for the domain."

They are a core component in many CS undergraduate degrees and address the ACM curricula requirements of inculcating professional dispositions in students and making them aware of the broader societal implications of computing. However, coordinating a capstone course, especially for a large student cohort, can be a daunting task for academic staff. It demands considerable time and energy for planning and coordinating activities between students, academic staff, and any external stakeholders. In this experience report, we outline the iterative development and refinement of our capstone course as it grew substantially in size over a span of six consecutive sessions. We outline the pedagogies that helped us to enhance student engagement and motivation in the course as assessed by end-of-course surveys and students' written reflections. We share the lessons that we have learnt and provide recommendations to educators who are designing new capstone courses or looking to scale existing ones."

The CS correction can be obtained perturbatively by considering the Kerr spacetime to be the background. We obtain the CS scalar field solution around the black hole analytically and numerically, assuming a stationary and axisymmetric configuration. The scalar field diverges on the inner horizon when we impose the boundary condition that the scalar field is regular on the outer horizon and vanishes at infinity. Therefore, the CS scalar field becomes problematic on the inner horizon."

In WSNs, CS based techniques are well motivated by not only the sparsity prior observed in different forms but also by the requirement of efficient in-network processing in terms of transmit power and communication bandwidth even with nonsparse signals. In order to apply CS in a variety of WSN applications efficiently, there are several factors to be considered beyond the standard CS framework. We start the discussion with a brief introduction to the theory of CS and then describe the motivational factors behind the potential use of CS in WSN applications. Then, we identify three main areas along which the standard CS framework is extended so that CS can be efficiently applied to solve a variety of problems specific to WSNs. In particular, we emphasize on the significance of extending the CS framework to (i). take communication constraints into account while designing projection matrices and reconstruction algorithms for signal reconstruction in centralized as well in decentralized settings, (ii) solve a variety of inference problems such as detection, classification and parameter estimation, with compressed data without signal reconstruction and (iii) take practical communication aspects such as measurement quantization, physical layer secrecy constraints, and imperfect channel conditions into account. Finally, open research issues and challenges are discussed in order to provide perspectives for future research directions."

    "title": "Multilevel Illumination Coding for Fourier Transform Interferometry in Fluorescence Spectroscopy",
    "summary": "Fourier Transform Interferometry (FTI) is an interferometric procedure for acquiring HyperSpectral (HS) data. Recently, it has been observed that the light source highlighting a (biologic) sample can be coded before the FTI acquisition in a procedure called Coded Illumination-FTI (CI-FTI). This turns HS data reconstruction into a Compressive Sensing (CS) problem regularized by the sparsity of the HS data. CI-FTI combines the high spectral resolution of FTI with the advantages of reduced-light-exposure imaging in biology. In this paper, we leverage multilevel sampling scheme recently developed in CS theory to adapt the coding strategy of CI-FTI to the spectral sparsity structure of HS data in Fluorescence Spectroscopy (FS). This structure is actually extracted from the spectral signatures of actual fluorescent dyes used in FS. Accordingly, the optimum illumination coding as well as the theoretical recovery guarantee are derived. We conduct numerous numerical experiments on synthetic and experimental data that show the faithfulness of the proposed theory to experimental observations."

    "summary": "We study two-qubit circuits over the Clifford+CS gate set, which consists of the Clifford gates together with the controlled-phase gate CS=diag(1,1,1,i). The Clifford+CS gate set is universal for quantum computation and its elements can be implemented fault-tolerantly in most error-correcting schemes through magic state distillation. Since non-Clifford gates are typically more expensive to perform in a fault-tolerant manner, it is often desirable to construct circuits that use few CS gates. In the present paper, we introduce an efficient and optimal synthesis algorithm for two-qubit Clifford+CS operators. Our algorithm inputs a Clifford+CS operator U and outputs a Clifford+CS circuit for U, which uses the least possible number of CS gates. Because the algorithm is deterministic, the circuit it associates to a Clifford+CS operator can be viewed as a normal form for that operator. We give an explicit description of these normal forms and use this description to derive a worst-case lower bound of 5log(1/epsilon)+O(1) on the number of CS gates required to epsilon-approximate elements of SU(4). Our work leverages a wide variety of mathematical tools that may find further applications in the study of fault-tolerant quantum circuits."

Observations of K-band near-infrared and multi-transition CS and N2H+ millimeter line emission are shown in relation to a sub-millimeter map of the cool dust around the most embedded stars. The near-infrared emission is offset from the dust peak suggesting a shift in the location of star formation over the history of the core. The CS emission is concentrated toward the core center but N2H+ peaks in two main cores offset from the center, opposite to the chemistry observed in low mass cores. A starless core with strong CS but weak N2H+ emission is found toward the western edge of the region. The average CS(2-1) spectrum over the cluster forming core is asymmetrically self-absorbed suggesting infall. We analyze the large scale dynamics by applying a one-dimensional radiative transfer code to a model spherical core with constant temperature and linewidth, and a density profile measured from an archival 850 micron map of the region. The best fit model that matches the three CS profiles requires a low CS abundance in the core and an outer, infalling envelope with a low density and undepleted CS abundance. The integrated intensities of the two N2H+ lines is well matched with a constant N2H+ abundance. The envelope infall velocity is tightly constrained by the CS(2-1) asymmetry and is sub-sonic but the size of the infalling region is poorly determined. The picture of a high density center with depleted CS slowly accreting a low density outer envelope with normal CS abundance suggests that core growth occurs at least partially by the dissipation of turbulent support on large scales."

    "summary": "For planning an assembly of a product from a given set of parts, robots necessitate certain cognitive skills: high-level planning is needed to decide the order of actuation actions, while geometric reasoning is needed to check the feasibility of these actions. For collaborative assembly tasks with humans, robots require further cognitive capabilities, such as commonsense reasoning, sensing, and communication skills, not only to cope with the uncertainty caused by incomplete knowledge about the humans' behaviors but also to ensure safer collaborations. We propose a novel method for collaborative assembly planning under uncertainty, that utilizes hybrid conditional planning extended with commonsense reasoning and a rich set of communication actions for collaborative tasks. Our method is based on answer set programming. We show the applicability of our approach in a real-world assembly domain, where a bi-manual Baxter robot collaborates with a human teammate to assemble furniture.

Previous research has explored methods to surface alarming privacy policies using manual labelers, natural language processing, and deep learning techniques. However, this prior work used pre-determined categories for annotations, and did not investigate what consumers really deem as important from their perspective. In this paper, we instead combine crowdsourcing with an open definition of \"what is important\" in T&Cs. We present a workflow consisting of pairwise comparisons, agreement validation, and Bradley-Terry rank modeling, to effectively establish rankings of T&C statements from non-expert crowdworkers on this open definition, and further analyzed consumers' preferences. We applied this workflow to 1,551 T&C statements from 27 e-commerce websites, contributed by 3,462 unique crowd workers doing 203,068 pairwise comparisons, and conducted thematic and readability analysis on the statements considered as important/unimportant. We found that consumers especially cared about policies related to after-sales and money, and tended to regard harder-to-understand statements as more important. We also present machine learning models to identify T&C clauses that consumers considered important, achieving at best a 92.7% balanced accuracy, 91.6% recall, and 89.2% precision. We foresee using our workflow and model to efficiently and reliably highlight important T&Cs on websites at a large scale, improving consumers' awareness"

    "summary": "In this work, we utilize the framework of compressed sensing (CS) for distributed device detection and resource allocation in large-scale machine-to-machine (M2M) communication networks. The devices deployed in the network are partitioned into clusters according to some pre-defined criteria. Moreover, the devices in each cluster are assigned a unique signature of a particular design that can be used to indicate their active status to the network. The proposed scheme in this work mainly consists of two essential steps: (i) The base station (BS) detects the active clusters and the number of active devices in each cluster using a novel block sketching algorithm, and then assigns a certain amount of resources accordingly. (ii) Each active device detects its ranking among all the active devices in its cluster using an enhanced greedy algorithm and accesses the corresponding resource for transmission based on the ranking. By exploiting the correlation in the device behaviors and the sparsity in the activation pattern of the M2M devices, the device detection problem is thus tackled as a CS support recovery procedure for a particular binary block-sparse signal -- with block sparsity and in-block sparsity over block size . Theoretical analysis shows that the activation pattern of the M2M devices can be reliably reconstructed within an acquisition time of , which achieves a better scaling and less computational complexity of compared with standard CS algorithms. Moreover, extensive simulations confirm the robustness of the proposed scheme in the detection process, especially in terms of higher detection probability and reduced access delay when compared with conventional schemes like LTE random access (RA) procedure and classic cluster-based access approaches."

    "title": "Free energy sources in current sheets formed in collisionless plasma turbulence",
    "summary": "Collisionless dissipation of macroscopic energy into heat is an unsolved problem of space and astrophysical plasmas, e.g., solar wind and Earth's magnetosheath. The most viable process under consideration is the turbulent-cascade of macroscopic energy to kinetic-scales where collisionless-plasma-processes dissipate the energy. Space observations and numerical simulations show the formation of kinetic scale current sheets in turbulent plasmas. Instabilities in these CS can provide collisionless dissipation and influence the turbulence. Spatial gradients of physical quantities and non-Maxwellian velocity distribution functions provide the free-energy-sources for CS plasma instabilities. To determine the free-energy-sources provided by the spatial gradients of plasma density and electron/ion bulk velocities in CS formed in collisionless turbulent plasmas with an external magnetic field , we carried out two-dimensional PIC-hybrid simulations and interpret the results within the limitations of the simulation model. We found that ion-scale CS in a collisionless turbulent plasma are formed primarily by electron shear flows, i.e., electron bulk velocity inside CS is much larger than ion bulk velocity while the density variations through the CS are relatively small ( 10\\%). The electron-bulk-velocity and, thus, the current density inside the sheets are directed mainly parallel to . The shear in the perpendicular electron- and ion-bulk-velocities generates parallel electron- and ion-flow-vorticities. Inside CS, parallel electron-flow-vorticity exceeds the parallel ion-flow-vorticity, changes sign around the CS centers and peaks near the CS edges. An ion temperature anisotropy develops near CS during the CS formation. It has positive correlation with the parallel ion- and electron-flow-vorticities. Theoretical estimates support the simulation results."

    "title": "Reduced Complexity Angle-Doppler-Range Estimation for MIMO Radar That Employs Compressive Sensing",
    "summary": "The authors recently proposed a MIMO radar system that is implemented by a small wireless network. By applying compressive sensing (CS) at the receive nodes, the MIMO radar super-resolution can be achieved with far fewer observations than conventional approaches. This previous work considered the estimation of direction of arrival and Doppler. Since the targets are sparse in the angle-velocity space, target information can be extracted by solving an l1 minimization problem. In this paper, the range information is exploited by introducing step frequency to MIMO radar with CS. The proposed approach is able to achieve high range resolution and also improve the ambiguous velocity. However, joint angle-Doppler-range estimation requires discretization of the angle-Doppler-range space which causes a sharp rise in the computational burden of the l1 minimization problem. To maintain an acceptable complexity, a technique is proposed to successively estimate angle, Doppler and range in a decoupled fashion. The proposed approach can significantly reduce the complexity without sacrificing performance."

    "title": "An Energy-Efficient Compressive Sensing Framework Incorporating Online Dictionary Learning for Long-term Wireless Health Monitoring",
    "summary": "Wireless body area network (WBAN) is emerging in the mobile healthcare area to replace the traditional wire-connected monitoring devices. As wireless data transmission dominates power cost of sensor nodes, it is beneficial to reduce the data size without much information loss. Compressive sensing (CS) is a perfect candidate to achieve this goal compared to existing compression techniques. In this paper, we proposed a general framework that utilize CS and online dictionary learning (ODL) together. The learned dictionary carries individual characteristics of the original signal, under which the signal has an even sparser representation compared to pre-determined dictionaries. As a consequence, the compression ratio is effectively improved by 2-4x comparing to prior works. Besides, the proposed framework offloads pre-processing from sensor nodes to the server node prior to dictionary learning, providing further reduction in hardware costs. As it is data driven, the proposed framework has the potential to be used with a wide range of physiological signals."

All three stars have -3.30 <= [Fe/H] <= -2.85 and moderate to high CNO abundances. CS 22958-042 is one of the most carbon-rich CEMP stars known ([C/Fe] = +3.2), while CS 29528-041 (one of the few N-enhanced metal-poor stars known) is one of the most nitrogen rich ([N/Fe] = +3.0). Oxygen is very high in CS 31080-095 ([O/Fe] = +2.35) and in CS 22958-042 ([O/Fe] = +1.35). All three stars exhibit [Sr/Fe] < 0; Ba is not detected in CS 22958-042 ([Ba/Fe] < -0.53), but it is moderately enhanced ([Ba/Fe] ~ 1) in the other two stars. CS 22958-042 displays one of the largest sodium overabundances yet found in CEMP stars ([Na/Fe] = +2.8). CS 22958-042 has 12C/13C = 9, similar to most other CEMP stars without enhanced neutron-capture elements, while 12C/13C <= 40 in CS 31080-095. CS 31080-095 and CS 29528-041 have A(Li) ~ 1.7, below the Spite Plateau, while Li is not detected in CS 22958-042. CS 22958-042 is a CEMP-no star, but the other two stars are in no known class of CEMP star and thus either constitute a new class or are a link between the CEMP-no and CEMP-s classes, adding complexity to the abundance patterns for CEMP stars. We interpret the abundance patterns in our stars to imply that current models for the presumed AGB binary progenitors lack an extra-mixing process, similar to those apparently operating in RGB stars."

It is manifest through the replacement of classical observables by CS quantum observables, which acts on a Hilbert space of prescribed dimension . The algebra of CS quantum observables has the finite dimension . The application to the 2-sphere provides a family of inequivalent CS quantizations, based on the spin spherical harmonics (the CS quantization from usual spherical harmonics appears to give a trivial issue for the cartesian coordinates). We compare these CS quantizations to the usual (Madore) construction of the fuzzy sphere. The difference allows us to consider our procedures as the constructions of new type of fuzzy spheres. The very general character of our method suggests applications to construct fuzzy versions of a variety of sets."

Their definition of strong noninvertibility has a small twist (``respecting the argument given'') that is needed to ensure cryptographic usefulness.

Based on a system model that takes into account the effects of synchronization impairments such as carrier frequency offset, sampling frequency offset, and symbol timing error, and channel, a Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithm for the joint estimation is proposed. To reduce the complexity of ML grid search, the number of received signal samples used for estimation need to be reduced. The conventional channel estimation methods using Least-Squares (LS) fail for the reduced sample under-determined system, which results in poor performance of the joint estimator. The proposed ML algorithm uses Compressed Sensing (CS) based channel estimation method in a sparse fading scenario, where the received samples used for estimation are less than that required for an LS based estimation. The performance of the estimation method is studied through numerical simulations, and it is observed that CS based joint estimator performs better than LS based joint estimator"

In this paper, we present a non-iterative image reconstruction method from patch-based compressively sensed random measurement. Our method features two cascaded networks based on residual convolution neural network to learn the end-to-end full image restoration, which is capable of reconstructing image patches and removing the blocky effect with low time cost. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art compressive sensing (CS) reconstruction methods with patch-based CS measurement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in more general setting, we apply the de-block process in our method to JPEG compression artifacts removal and achieve outstanding performance as well."

We discuss the experimental tools and procedures to facilitate Cs-Rb interaction. First, we use degenerate Raman side-band cooling of the impurities to enhance the immersion efficiency for the impurity in the quantum gas. We identify the immersed fraction of Cs impurities from the thermalization of Cs atoms upon impinging on a BEC, where elastic collisions lead to a localization of Cs atoms in the Rb cloud. Second, further enhancement of the immersion probability is obtained by localizing the Cs atoms in a species-selective optical lattice and subsequent transport into the Rb cloud. Here, impurity-BEC interaction is monitored by position and time resolved three-body loss of Cs impurities immersed into the BEC. This combination of experimental methods allows for the controlled doping of a BEC with neutral impurity atoms, paving the way to impurity aided probing and coherent impurity-quantum bath interaction."

    "title": "AMP-Net: Denoising based Deep Unfolding for Compressive Image Sensing",
    "summary": "Most compressive sensing (CS) reconstruction methods can be divided into two categories, i.e. model-based methods and classical deep network methods. By unfolding the iterative optimization algorithm for model-based methods onto networks, deep unfolding methods have the good interpretation of model-based methods and the high speed of classical deep network methods. In this paper, to solve the visual image CS problem, we propose a deep unfolding model dubbed AMP-Net. Rather than learning regularization terms, it is established by unfolding the iterative denoising process of the well-known approximate message passing algorithm. Furthermore, AMP-Net integrates deblocking modules in order to eliminate the blocking artifacts that usually appear in CS of visual images. In addition, the sampling matrix is jointly trained with other network parameters to enhance the reconstruction performance. Experimental results show that the proposed AMP-Net has better reconstruction accuracy than other state-of-the-art methods with high reconstruction speed and a small number of network parameters."

This is accomplished by applying a similarity transformation to the generally deformed oscillator algebra (GDOA) generators for PDEM system and construct a new set of operators which close the su(1, 1) Lie algebra, being the PDEM CS of the basis for its unitary irreducible representation. The residual potential is associated to the SHO. From the Lie algebra generators, we evaluate the uncertainty relationship for a position and momentum-like operators in the PDEM CS and show that it is minimized in the sense of Barut-Girardello CS. We prove that the deduced PDEM CS preserve the same analytical form than those of Glauber states. We show that the probability density of dynamical evolution in the PDEM CS oscillates back and forth as time goes by and behaves as classical wave packet."

However, despite its significant impact on scholarly space, only a limited number of studies have been conducted to analyze the research trends and relationships within computer science. In this study, we collected information on fields and subfields from over 2,000 research articles published in the 2022 proceedings of the top Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) conferences spanning various research fields. Through a network approach, we investigated the interconnections between CS fields and subfields to evaluate their interdisciplinarity and multidisciplinarity. Our findings indicate that computing methodologies and privacy and security stand out as the most interdisciplinary fields, while human-centered computing exhibits the highest frequency among the papers. Furthermore, we discovered that machine learning emerges as the most interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary subfield within computer science. These results offer valuable insights for universities seeking to foster interdisciplinary research opportunities for their students."

The baryon classical solution in this model is given by the BPST instanton, and we carry out the collective coordinate quantization of the solution. The CS term should give rise to a first class constraint which selects baryon states with right spins. However, the original CS term written in terms of the CS 5-form does not work. We instead propose a new CS term which is gauge invariant and is given as an integral over a six dimensional space having as its boundary the original five dimensional spacetime of the holographic model. Collective coordinate quantization using our new CS term leads to correct baryon states and their mass formula."

Using the derived formal set-up recently found, the model can be formulated in a way that in many respects closely parallels that of the familiar 3d CS one. In spite of these formal resemblance, the gauge invariance properties of the 4d CS model differ considerably. The 4d CS action is fully gauge invariant if the underlying base 4fold has no boundary. When it does, the action is gauge variant, the gauge variation being a boundary term. If certain boundary conditions are imposed on the gauge fields and gauge transformations, level quantization can then occur. In the canonical formulation of the theory, it is found that, depending again on boundary conditions, the 4d CS model is characterized by surface charges obeying a non trivial Poisson bracket algebra. This is a higher counterpart of the familiar WZNW current algebra arising in the 3d model. 4d CS theory thus exhibits rich holographic properties. The covariant Schroedinger quantization of the 4d CS model is performed. A preliminary analysis of 4d CS edge field theory is also provided. The toric and Abelian projected models are described in some detail."

In this paper, we derive sparse recovery guarantees with OMP, when the CS matrix has unequal column norms. Finally, we show that CS matrices whose column norms are comparable achieve tight guarantees for the successful recovery of the support of a sparse signal and a low mean squared error in the estimate."

    "summary": "Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication is one viable solution to support Gbps sensor data sharing in vehicular networks. The use of large antenna arrays at mmWave and high mobility in vehicular communication make it challenging to design fast beam alignment solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that learns the channel angle-of-departure (AoD) statistics at a base station (BS) and uses this information to efficiently acquire channel measurements. Our framework integrates online learning for compressive sensing (CS) codebook learning and the optimized codebook is used for CS-based beam alignment. We formulate a CS matrix optimization problem based on the AoD statistics available at the BS. Furthermore, based on the CS channel measurements, we develop techniques to update and learn such channel AoD statistics at the BS. We use the upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm to learn the AoD statistics and the CS matrix. Numerical results show that the CS matrix in the proposed framework provides faster beam alignment than standard CS matrix designs. Simulation results indicate that the proposed beam training technique can reduce overhead by 80% compared to exhaustive beam search, and 70% compared to standard CS solutions that do not exploit any AoD statistics."

    "title": "Learning to Invert: Signal Recovery via Deep Convolutional Networks",
    "summary": "The promise of compressive sensing (CS) has been offset by two significant challenges. First, real-world data is not exactly sparse in a fixed basis. Second, current high-performance recovery algorithms are slow to converge, which limits CS to either non-real-time applications or scenarios where massive back-end computing is available. In this paper, we attack both of these challenges head-on by developing a new signal recovery framework we call DeepInverse that learns the inverse transformation from measurement vectors to signals using a deep convolutional network . When trained on a set of representative images, the network learns both a representation for the signals (addressing challenge one) and an inverse map approximating a greedy or convex recovery algorithm (addressing challenge two). Our experiments indicate that the DeepInverse network closely approximates the solution produced by state-of-the-art CS recovery algorithms yet is hundreds of times faster in run time. The tradeoff for the ultrafast run time is a computationally intensive, off-line training procedure typical to deep networks. However, the training needs to be completed only once, which makes the approach attractive for a host of sparse recovery problems."

    "summary": "As information economies burgeon, they unlock innovation and economic wealth while posing novel threats to civil liberties and altering power dynamics between individuals, companies, and governments. Legislatures have reacted with privacy laws designed to empower individuals over their data. These laws typically create rights for \"data subjects\" (individuals) to make requests of data collectors (companies and governments). The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) exemplifies this, granting extensive data rights to data subjects, a model embraced globally. However, the question remains: do these rights-based privacy laws effectively empower individuals over their data? This paper scrutinizes these approaches by reviewing 201 interdisciplinary empirical studies, news articles, and blog posts. We pinpoint 15 key questions concerning the efficacy of rights allocations. The literature often presents conflicting results regarding the effectiveness of rights-based frameworks, but it generally emphasizes their limitations. We offer recommendations to policymakers and Computer Science (CS) groups committed to these frameworks, and suggest alternative privacy regulation approaches."

    "summary": "In this paper, we propose a novel method for efficient implementation of a massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (massive MIMO) system with Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) operation. Our main objective is to reduce the large overhead incurred by Downlink (DL) common training and Uplink (UL) feedback needed to obtain channel state information (CSI) at the base station. Our proposed scheme relies on the fact that the underlying angular distribution of a channel vector, also known as the angular scattering function, is a frequency-invariant entity yielding a UL-DL reciprocity and has a limited angular support. We estimate this support from UL CSI and interpolate it to obtain the corresponding angular support of the DL channel. Finally we exploit the estimated support of the DL channel of all the users to design an efficient channel probing and feedback scheme that maximizes the total spectral efficiency of the system. Our method is different from the existing compressed-sensing (CS) based techniques in the literature. Using support information helps reduce the feedback overhead from O(s*log M) in CS techniques to O(s) in our proposed method, with and being sparsity order of the channel vectors and the number of base station antennas, respectively. Furthermore, in order to control the channel sparsity and therefore the DL common training and UL feedback overhead, we introduce the novel concept of active channel sparsification. In brief, when the fixed pilot dimension is less than the required amount for reliable channel estimation, we introduce a pre-beamforming matrix that artificially reduces the effective channel dimension of each user to be not larger than the DL pilot dimension, while maximizing both the number of served users and the number of probed angles. We provide numerical experiments to compare our method with the state-of-the-art CS technique."

The plug & play nature lies in the fact that manual configuration is not required, including the teaching of the robots. In this paper a digital twin (DT) based concept is proposed that outlines the types of information that have to be provided for each relevant component of the system. In particular, for the devices interfacing with the robot, the robot positions have to be defined beforehand in a device-attached coordinate system (CS) by the vendor. This CS has to be detectable by the vision system of the robot by means of optical markers placed on the front side of the device. With that, the robot is capable of tending the machine by performing the pick-and-place type transportation of standard sample carriers. This basic use case is the primary scope of the LAPP-DT framework. The hardware scope is limited to simple benchtop and mobile manipulators with parallel grippers at this stage. This paper first provides an overview of relevant literature and state-of-the-art solutions, after which it outlines the framework on the conceptual level, followed by the specification of the relevant DT parameters for the robot, for the devices and for the facility.

The study is based on low-resolution (R ~ 2000 and 4000) spectropolarimetric data collected from 2003 to 2005 at the Very Large Telescope (ESO, Chile) with the multi-mode instrument FORS1. We show that the spectropolarimetric results strongly depend on the level of CS contribution to the stellar spectra. We have improved the determination accuracy of magnetic fields up to the 7 sigma level in the two Herbig Ae stars HD139614 and HD144432, observed in 2005 when these objects were at a low level state of their CS activity. We have established that at a higher level state of CS activity the polarisation signatures are related mainly to the CS matter. The presence of CS polarisation signatures formed in the stellar wind supports the assumption that the magnetic centrifuge is a principal mechanism of wind acceleration. We conclude that the most effective way to investigate the magnetism of Herbig Ae stars is to monitor their spectropolarimetric behaviour at different states of CS activity. Obviously, higher resolution spectropolarimetric observations would extend the sample of spectral lines to be used for the measurements of magnetic fields at different levels in the stellar atmosphere and CS envelope. Such observations will give a more complete insight into the magnetic topology in Herbig Ae stars."

    "summary": "Fetal ECG (FECG) telemonitoring is an important branch in telemedicine. The design of a telemonitoring system via a wireless body-area network with low energy consumption for ambulatory use is highly desirable. As an emerging technique, compressed sensing (CS) shows great promise in compressing/reconstructing data with low energy consumption. However, due to some specific characteristics of raw FECG recordings such as non-sparsity and strong noise contamination, current CS algorithms generally fail in this application. This work proposes to use the block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) framework to compress/reconstruct non-sparse raw FECG recordings. Experimental results show that the framework can reconstruct the raw recordings with high quality. Especially, the reconstruction does not destroy the interdependence relation among the multichannel recordings. This ensures that the independent component analysis decomposition of the reconstructed recordings has high fidelity. Furthermore, the framework allows the use of a sparse binary sensing matrix with much fewer nonzero entries to compress recordings. Particularly, each column of the matrix can contain only two nonzero entries. This shows the framework, compared to other algorithms such as current CS algorithms and wavelet algorithms, can greatly reduce code execution in CPU in the data compression stage."

In this paper, we first study the outage performance of the greedy best user scheduling SGF scheme (BU-SGF) by considering the impacts of Rayleigh fading, path loss, and random user locations. In order to tackle the admission fairness problem of the BU-SGF scheme, we propose a fair SGF scheme by applying cumulative distribution function (CDF)-based scheduling (CS-SGF), in which the GF user with the best channel relative to its own statistics will be admitted. Moreover, by employing the theories of order statistics and stochastic geometry, the outage performances of both BU-SGF and CS-SGF schemes are analyzed. Theoretical results show that both schemes can achieve full diversity orders only when the served users' data rate is capped, which severely limits the rate performance of SGF schemes. To further address this issue, we propose a distributed power control strategy to relax such data rate constraint, and derive analytical expressions of the two schemes' outage performances under this strategy. Finally, simulation results validate the fairness performance of the proposed CS-SGF scheme, the effectiveness of the power control strategy, and the accuracy of the theoretical analyses."

    "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) bridge the gap between visual and textual data, enabling a range of advanced applications. However, complex internal interactions among visual elements and their alignment with text can introduce vulnerabilities, which may be exploited to bypass safety mechanisms. To address this, we analyze the relationship between image content and task and find that the complexity of subimages, rather than their content, is key. Building on this insight, we propose the Distraction Hypothesis, followed by a novel framework called Contrasting Subimage Distraction Jailbreaking (CS-DJ), to achieve jailbreaking by disrupting MLLMs alignment through multi-level distraction strategies. CS-DJ consists of two components: structured distraction, achieved through query decomposition that induces a distributional shift by fragmenting harmful prompts into sub-queries, and visual-enhanced distraction, realized by constructing contrasting subimages to disrupt the interactions among visual elements within the model. This dual strategy disperses the model's attention, reducing its ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Extensive experiments across five representative scenarios and four popular closed-source MLLMs, including GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4o, GPT-4V, and Gemini-1.5-Flash, demonstrate that CS-DJ achieves average success rates of 52.40% for the attack success rate and 74.10% for the ensemble attack success rate. These results reveal the potential of distraction-based approaches to exploit and bypass MLLMs' defenses, offering new insights for attack strategies."

    "summary": "Compressive sensing (CS) is widely used to reduce the acquisition time of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although state-of-the-art deep learning based methods have been able to obtain fast, high-quality reconstruction of CS-MR images, their main drawback is that they treat complex-valued MRI data as real-valued entities. Most methods either extract the magnitude from the complex-valued entities or concatenate them as two real-valued channels. In both the cases, the phase content, which links the real and imaginary parts of the complex-valued entities, is discarded. In order to address the fundamental problem of real-valued deep networks, i.e. their inability to process complex-valued data, we propose a novel framework based on a complex-valued generative adversarial network (Co-VeGAN). Our model can process complex-valued input, which enables it to perform high-quality reconstruction of the CS-MR images. Further, considering that phase is a crucial component of complex-valued entities, we propose a novel complex-valued activation function, which is sensitive to the phase of the input. Extensive evaluation of the proposed approach on different datasets using various sampling masks demonstrates that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing CS-MRI reconstruction techniques in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio as well as structural similarity index. Further, it uses significantly fewer trainable parameters to do so, as compared to the real-valued deep learning based methods."

As in arXiv:2309.00532, we enforce the second-order property of converse wellfoundedness by using techniques from cyclic proof theory. We will prove soundness and completeness of this system with respect to the semantics and provide a primitive decision procedure together with a way to extract countermodels."

    "title": "SEGAN: Structure-Enhanced Generative Adversarial Network for Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction",
    "summary": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful tools for reconstructing Compressed Sensing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CS-MRI). However most recent works lack exploration of structure information of MRI images that is crucial for clinical diagnosis. To tackle this problem, we propose the Structure-Enhanced GAN (SEGAN) that aims at restoring structure information at both local and global scale. SEGAN defines a new structure regularization called Patch Correlation Regularization (PCR) which allows for efficient extraction of structure information. In addition, to further enhance the ability to uncover structure information, we propose a novel generator SU-Net by incorporating multiple-scale convolution filters into each layer. Besides, we theoretically analyze the convergence of stochastic factors contained in training process. Experimental results show that SEGAN is able to learn target structure information and achieves state-of-the-art performance for CS-MRI reconstruction."

Leveraging a design-based research approach, we develop, implement, and evaluate a novel learning environment enriched with four distinct chatbot roles: Instructor Bot, Peer Bot, Career Advising Bot, and Emotional Supporter Bot. These roles, designed around the tenets of Self-Determination Theory, cater to the three innate psychological needs of learners - competence, autonomy, and relatedness. Additionally, the system embraces an inquiry-based learning paradigm, encouraging students to ask questions, seek solutions, and explore their curiosities. We test this system in a higher education context over a period of one month with 200 participating students, comparing outcomes with conditions involving a human tutor and a single chatbot. Our research utilizes a mixed-methods approach, encompassing quantitative measures such as chat log sequence analysis, and qualitative methods including surveys and focus group interviews. By integrating cutting-edge Natural Language Processing techniques such as topic modelling and sentiment analysis, we offer an in-depth understanding of the system's impact on learner engagement, motivation, and inquiry-based learning. This study, through its rigorous design and innovative approach, provides significant insights into the potential of AI-empowered, multi-role chatbots in reshaping the landscape of computer science education and fostering an engaging, supportive, and motivating learning environment."

    "title": "Reconstruction of a Large-scale Pre-flare Coronal Current Sheet Associated with an Homologous X-shaped Flare",
    "summary": "As a fundamental magnetic structure in the solar corona, electric current sheets (CSs) can form either prior to or during solar flare, and they are essential for magnetic energy dissipation in the solar corona by enabling magnetic reconnection. However static reconstruction of CS is rare, possibly due to limitation inherent in available coronal field extrapolation codes. Here we present the reconstruction of a large-scale pre-flare CS in solar active region 11967 using an MHD-relaxation model constrained by SDO/HMI vector magnetogram. The CS is found to be associated with a set of peculiar homologous flares that exhibit unique X-shaped ribbons and loops occurring in a quadrupolar magnetic configuration. This is evidenced by that the field lines traced from the CS to the photosphere form an X shape which nearly precisely reproduces the shape of the observed flare ribbons, suggesting that the flare is a product of the dissipation of the CS through reconnection. The CS forms in a hyperbolic flux tube, which is an intersection of two quasi-separatrix layers. The recurrence of the X-shaped flares might be attributed to the repetitive formation and dissipation of the CS, as driven by the photospheric footpoint motions. These results demonstrate the power of data-constrained MHD model in reproducing CS in the corona as well as providing insight into the magnetic mechanism of solar flares."

    "title": "Efficient Low Dose X-ray CT Reconstruction through Sparsity-Based MAP Modeling",
    "summary": "Ultra low radiation dose in X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) is an important clinical objective in order to minimize the risk of carcinogenesis. Compressed Sensing (CS) enables significant reductions in radiation dose to be achieved by producing diagnostic images from a limited number of CT projections. However, the excessive computation time that conventional CS-based CT reconstruction typically requires has limited clinical implementation. In this paper, we first demonstrate that a thorough analysis of CT reconstruction through a Maximum a Posteriori objective function results in a weighted compressive sensing problem. This analysis enables us to formulate a low dose fan beam and helical cone beam CT reconstruction. Subsequently, we provide an efficient solution to the formulated CS problem based on a Fast Composite Splitting Algorithm-Latent Expected Maximization (FCSA-LEM) algorithm. In the proposed method we use pseudo polar Fourier transform as the measurement matrix in order to decrease the computational complexity; and rebinning of the projections to parallel rays in order to extend its application to fan beam and helical cone beam scans. The weight involved in the proposed weighted CS model, denoted by Error Adaptation Weight (EAW), is calculated based on the statistical characteristics of CT reconstruction and is a function of Poisson measurement noise and rebinning interpolation error. Simulation results show that low computational complexity of the proposed method made the fast recovery of the CT images possible and using EAW reduces the reconstruction error by one order of magnitude. Recovery of a high quality 512 512 image was achieved in less than 20 sec on a desktop computer without numerical optimizations."

The lines have equivalent widths ranging from 2.3 to 26.9 mÅ. We performed a spectral synthesis analysis to determine the cesium content in the atmosphere. Non-LTE atmosphere models were computed by considering cesium explicitly in the calculations. For this purpose we calculated oscillator strengths for the bound-bound transitions of Cs IV-Cs VI with both AUTOSTRUCTURE (multiconfiguration Breit-Pauli) and GRASP2K (multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock) atomic structure codes as neither measured nor theoretical values are reported in the literature. We determined a cesium abundance of log N(Cs)/N(He) = -5.45(0.35), which can also be expressed in terms of the mass fraction log X(Cs) = -3.95(0.35)."

    "summary": "We study the tetrad formulation of Chern-Simons (CS) modified gravity, which adds a Pontryagin term to the Einstein-Hilbert action with a spacetime-dependent coupling field. We first verify that CS modified gravity leads to a theory with torsion, where this tensor is given by an antisymmetric product of the Riemann tensor and derivatives of the CS coupling. We then calculate the torsion in the far field of a weakly gravitating source within the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism, and specialize the result to Earth. We find that CS torsion vanishes only if the coupling vanishes, thus generically leading to a modification of gyroscopic precession, irrespective of the coupling choice. Perhaps most interestingly, we couple fermions to CS modified gravity via the standard Dirac action and find that these further correct the torsion tensor. Such a correction leads to two new results: (i) a generic enhancement of CS modified gravity by the Dirac equation and axial fermion currents; (ii) a new two-fermion interactions, mediated by an axial current and the CS correction. We conclude with a discussion of the consequences of these results in particle detectors and realistic astrophysical systems."

    "title": "Compressive Imaging and Characterization of Sparse Light Deflection Maps",
    "summary": "Light rays incident on a transparent object of uniform refractive index undergo deflections, which uniquely characterize the surface geometry of the object. Associated with each point on the surface is a deflection map (or spectrum) which describes the pattern of deflections in various directions. This article presents a novel method to efficiently acquire and reconstruct sparse deflection spectra induced by smooth object surfaces. To this end, we leverage the framework of Compressed Sensing (CS) in a particular implementation of a schlieren deflectometer, i.e., an optical system providing linear measurements of deflection spectra with programmable spatial light modulation patterns. We design those modulation patterns on the principle of spread spectrum CS for reducing the number of observations. The ability of our device to simultaneously observe the deflection spectra on a dense discretization of the object surface is related to a Multiple Measurement Vector (MMV) model. This scheme allows us to estimate both the noise power and the instrumental point spread function. We formulate the spectrum reconstruction task as the solving of a linear inverse problem regularized by an analysis sparsity prior using a translation invariant wavelet frame. Our results demonstrate the capability and advantages of using a CS based approach for deflectometric imaging both on simulated data and experimental deflectometric data. Finally, the paper presents an extension of our method showing how we can extract the main deflection direction in each point of the object surface from a few compressive measurements, without needing any costly reconstruction procedures. This compressive characterization is then confirmed with experimental results on simple plano-convex and multifocal intra-ocular lenses studying the evolution of the main deflection as a function of the object point location."

    "summary": "Millimeter wave channels exhibit structure that allows beam alignment with fewer channel measurements than exhaustive beam search. From a compressed sensing (CS) perspective, the received channel measurements are usually obtained by multiplying a CS matrix with a sparse representation of the channel matrix. Due to the constraints imposed by analog processing, designing CS matrices that efficiently exploit the channel structure is, however, challenging. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning technique to design a structured CS matrix that is well suited to the underlying channel distribution, leveraging both sparsity and the particular spatial structure that appears in vehicular channels. The channel measurements acquired with the designed CS matrix are then used to predict the best beam for link configuration. Simulation results for vehicular communication channels indicate that our deep learning-based approach achieves better beam alignment than standard CS techniques that use the random phase shift-based design."

    "title": "CSFNet: A Cosine Similarity Fusion Network for Real-Time RGB-X Semantic Segmentation of Driving Scenes",
    "summary": "Semantic segmentation, as a crucial component of complex visual interpretation, plays a fundamental role in autonomous vehicle vision systems. Recent studies have significantly improved the accuracy of semantic segmentation by exploiting complementary information and developing multimodal methods. Despite the gains in accuracy, multimodal semantic segmentation methods suffer from high computational complexity and low inference speed. Therefore, it is a challenging task to implement multimodal methods in driving applications. To address this problem, we propose the Cosine Similarity Fusion Network (CSFNet) as a real-time RGB-X semantic segmentation model. Specifically, we design a Cosine Similarity Attention Fusion Module (CS-AFM) that effectively rectifies and fuses features of two modalities. The CS-AFM module leverages cross-modal similarity to achieve high generalization ability. By enhancing the fusion of cross-modal features at lower levels, CS-AFM paves the way for the use of a single-branch network at higher levels. Therefore, we use dual and single-branch architectures in an encoder, along with an efficient context module and a lightweight decoder for fast and accurate predictions. To verify the effectiveness of CSFNet, we use the Cityscapes, MFNet, and ZJU datasets for the RGB-D/T/P semantic segmentation. According to the results, CSFNet has competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art methods while being state-of-the-art in terms of speed among multimodal semantic segmentation models. It also achieves high efficiency due to its low parameter count and computational complexity. The source code for CSFNet will be available at https://github.com/Danial-Qashqai/CSFNet."

Extensive research has been conducted on detecting partiality patterns in the academic community. However, in the last few decades, limited research has focused on assessing gender and nationality biases in graduate admission results of universities. In this study, we collected a novel and comprehensive dataset containing information on approximately 14,000 graduate students majoring in computer science (CS) at the top 25 North American universities. We used statistical hypothesis tests to determine whether there is a preference for students' gender and nationality in the admission processes. In addition to partiality patterns, we discuss the relationship between gender/nationality diversity and the scientific achievements of research teams. Consistent with previous studies, our findings show that there is no gender bias in the admission of graduate students to research groups, but we observed bias based on students' nationality."

    "summary": "Feature extraction, such as spectral occupancy, interferer energy and type, or direction-of-arrival, from wideband radio-frequency~(RF) signals finds use in a growing number of applications as it enhances RF transceivers with cognitive abilities and enables parameter tuning of traditional RF chains. In power and cost limited applications, e.g., for sensor nodes in the Internet of Things, wideband RF feature extraction with conventional, Nyquist-rate analog-to-digital converters is infeasible. However, the structure of many RF features (such as signal sparsity) enables the use of compressive sensing (CS) techniques that acquire such signals at sub-Nyquist rates. While such CS-based analog-to-information (A2I) converters have the potential to enable low-cost and energy-efficient wideband RF sensing, they suffer from a variety of real-world limitations, such as noise folding, low sensitivity, aliasing, and limited flexibility. This paper proposes a novel CS-based A2I architecture called non-uniform wavelet sampling (NUWS). Our solution extracts a carefully-selected subset of wavelet coefficients directly in the RF domain, which mitigates the main issues of existing A2I converter architectures. For multi-band RF signals, we propose a specialized variant called non-uniform wavelet bandpass sampling (NUWBS), which further improves sensitivity and reduces hardware complexity by leveraging the multi-band signal structure. We use simulations to demonstrate that NUWBS approaches the theoretical performance limits of -norm-based sparse signal recovery. We investigate hardware-design aspects and show ASIC measurement results for the wavelet generation stage, which highlight the efficacy of NUWBS for a broad range of RF feature extraction tasks in cost- and power-limited applications."

    "summary": "Deep learning based image compressed sensing (CS) has achieved great success. However, existing CS systems mainly adopt a fixed measurement matrix to images, ignoring the fact the optimal measurement numbers and bases are different for different images. To further improve the sensing efficiency, we propose a novel semantic-aware image CS system. In our system, the encoder first uses a fixed number of base CS measurements to sense different images. According to the base CS results, the encoder then employs a policy network to analyze the semantic information in images and determines the measurement matrix for different image areas. At the decoder side, a semantic-aware initial reconstruction network is developed to deal with the changes of measurement matrices used at the encoder. A rate-distortion training loss is further introduced to dynamically adjust the average compression ratio for the semantic-aware CS system and the policy network is trained jointly with the encoder and the decoder in an en-to-end manner by using some proxy functions. Numerical results show that the proposed semantic-aware image CS system is superior to the traditional ones with fixed measurement matrices."

A simple explanation of the equality between noncommutative and commutative CS actions in and is obtained. The dependent terms are present for and give a higher derivative theory on commutative space reducing to classical CS theory for . These terms depend on the field strength and not on the bare gauge potential. In particular, as for the Dirac-Born-Infeld action, these terms vanish in the slowly varying field strength approximation: in this case noncommutative and commutative CS actions coincide in any dimension. The Seiberg-Witten map on the noncommutative CS theory is explored in more detail, and we give its second order -expansion for any gauge group. The example of extended CS gravity, where the gauge group is , is treated explicitly."

    "title": "Compressed Channel Feedback for Correlated Massive MIMO Systems",

These advantages, however, can be realized only when channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter. Since there are many antennas, CSI is too large to feed back without compression. To compress CSI, prior work has applied compressive sensing (CS) techniques and the fact that CSI can be sparsified. The adopted sparsifying bases fail, however, to reflect the spatial correlation and channel conditions or to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we propose a new sparsifying basis that reflects the long-term characteristics of the channel, and needs no change as long as the spatial correlation model does not change. We propose a new reconstruction algorithm for CS, and also suggest dimensionality reduction as a compression method. To feed back compressed CSI in practice, we propose a new codebook for the compressed channel quantization assuming no other-cell interference. Numerical results confirm that the proposed channel feedback mechanisms show better performance in point-to-point (single-user) and point-to-multi-point (multi-user) scenarios."

The proofs are based on a common semantical framework which is merely instantiated in four different ways. The framework consists of an innovative modification of realizability which allows us to use resource-bounded computations as realisers as opposed to including all Turing computable functions as is usually the case in realizability constructions. For example, all realisers in the model for LFPL are polynomially bounded computations whence soundness holds by construction of the model. The work then lies in being able to interpret all the required constructs in the model. While being the first entirely semantical proof of polytime soundness for light logi cs, our proof also provides a notable simplification of the original already semantical proof of polytime soundness for LFPL. A new result made possible by the semantic framework is the addition of polymorphism and a modality to LFPL thus allowing for an internal definition of inductive datatypes."

    "summary": "Understanding the observed Cold Spot (CS) (temperature of ~ -150 mu K at its centre) on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is an outstanding problem. Explanations vary from assuming it is just a > 3 sigma primordial Gaussian fluctuation to the imprint of a supervoid via the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe and Rees-Sciama (ISW+RS) effects. Since single spherical supervoids cannot account for the full profile, the ISW+RS of multiple line-of-sight voids is studied here to mimic the structure of the cosmic web. Two structure configurations are considered. The first, through simulations of 20 voids, produces a central mean temperature of ~-50 mu K. In this model the central CS temperature lies at ~ 2 sigma but fails to explain the CS hot ring. An alternative multi-void model (using more pronounced compensated voids) produces much smaller temperature profiles, but contains a prominent hot ring. Arrangements containing closely placed voids at low redshift are found to be particularly well suited to produce CS-like profiles. We then measure the significance of the CS if CS-like profiles (which are fitted to the ISW+RS of multi-void scenarios) are removed. The CS tension with the LCDM model can be reduced dramatically for an array of temperature profiles smaller than the CS itself."

Time evolutions of the Doppler shifts, and Line width of Fe~ XII 195.119 line are studied over the CS borders. Transverse kink oscillations are observed both in the Solar-Y direction and in the Doppler shifts over the observers' LOS.

The main kink amplitude velocity and periods are obtained to be 5.3 , and 33.4 minutes, respectively. The anti-correlation observed between the brightness and thickness of the CS (with -178.1 ) suggests the presence of sausage modes with periods of 20.8 minutes.

It is shown that: a) a time-like CS vector makes the vacuum unstable under pairs creation of tachyonic photon modes with the finite vacuum decay rate, i.e. it is unlikely realized at macroscopic time scales; b) on the contrary, the space-like CS vector does not yield any tachyonic modes and, moreover, if its dynamical counterpart is substantially described by a scale invariant interaction, then the QED radiation effects induce the dynamical breaking of Lorentz symmetry, i.e. the occurrence of space-like CS vector appears to be rather natural."

Experimental data suggest a self-similar behavior of the critical shear rate and relaxation time as functions of Cs. Specifically, the former ~ Cs^(-6) whereas the latter ~ Cs^(6) such that an effective Weissenberg number for the onset of the shear thickened phase is only weakly dependent on Cs. A procedure has been developed to collapse the apparent shear viscosity versus shear rate data obtained for various values of Cs into a single master curve. The effect of Cs on the elastic modulus and mesh size of the shear-induced gel phase for different surfactant concentrations is discussed. Experiments performed using different flow cells (Couette and cone-and-plate) show that the critical shear rate, relaxation time and the maximum viscosity attained are geometry-independent. The elastic modulus of the gel phase inferred indirectly by employing simplified hydrodynamic instability analysis of a sheared gel-fluid interface is in qualitative agreement with that predicted for an entangled phase of living polymers. A qualitative mechanism that combines the effect of Cs on average micelle length and Debye parameter with shear-induced configurational changes of rod-like micelles is proposed to rationalize the self-similarity of SIS formation."

    "summary": "Compressed Sensing (CS) takes advantage of signal sparsity or compressibility and allows superb signal reconstruction from relatively few measurements. Based on CS theory, a suitable dictionary for sparse representation of the signal is required. In diffusion MRI (dMRI), CS methods were proposed to reconstruct diffusion-weighted signal and the Ensemble Average Propagator (EAP), and there are two kinds of Dictionary Learning (DL) methods: 1) Discrete Representation DL (DR-DL), and 2) Continuous Representation DL (CR-DL). DR-DL is susceptible to numerical inaccuracy owing to interpolation and regridding errors in a discretized q-space. In this paper, we propose a novel CR-DL approach, called Dictionary Learning - Spherical Polar Fourier Imaging (DL-SPFI) for effective compressed-sensing reconstruction of the q-space diffusion-weighted signal and the EAP. In DL-SPFI, an dictionary that sparsifies the signal is learned from the space of continuous Gaussian diffusion signals. The learned dictionary is then adaptively applied to different voxels using a weighted LASSO framework for robust signal reconstruction. The adaptive dictionary is proved to be optimal. Compared with the start-of-the-art CR-DL and DR-DL methods proposed by Merlet et al. and Bilgic et al., espectively, our work offers the following advantages. First, the learned dictionary is proved to be optimal for Gaussian diffusion signals. Second, to our knowledge, this is the first work to learn a voxel-adaptive dictionary. The importance of the adaptive dictionary in EAP reconstruction will be demonstrated theoretically and empirically. Third, optimization in DL-SPFI is only performed in a small subspace resided by the SPF coefficients, as opposed to the q-space approach utilized by Merlet et al. The experiment results demonstrate the advantages of DL-SPFI over the original SPF basis and Bilgic et al.'s method."

In this work, we consider the interesting, yet relatively unexplored, dynamical formulation of CS modified gravity, where the CS coupling field is treated as a dynamical field, endowed with its own stress-energy tensor and evolution equation. We consider the possibility of observationally testing dynamical CS modified gravity by using the accretion disk properties around slowly-rotating black holes. The energy flux, temperature distribution, the emission spectrum as well as the energy conversion efficiency are obtained, and compared to the standard general relativistic Kerr solution. It is shown that the Kerr black hole provide a more efficient engine for the transformation of the energy of the accreting mass into radiation than their slowly-rotating counterparts in CS modified gravity. Specific signatures appear in the electromagnetic spectrum, thus leading to the possibility of directly testing CS modified gravity by using astrophysical observations of the emission spectra from accretion disks."

We call this particle the Chern-Simons (CS) boson. We construct an effective Lagrangian of the CS boson interaction with quarks of two different flavors. This interaction is given by a divergent loop diagram, however, it turns out that the divergent part is equal to zero as a consequence of the CKM matrix unitarity in the SM. Therefore, we are able to predict the effective interaction of the CS boson with quarks of different flavors without introducing new unknown parameters to the model, using only parameters of the initial effective Lagrangian. Our result shows that the effective interaction of the CS boson with down-type quarks is sufficiently stronger compared with up-type quarks. Based on our results, we give a prediction for the production of CS bosons in mesons decays. Branching fractions were obtained for the main reactions of the CS production in meson decays. The results obtained will be useful for searching for the long-lived GeV-scale CS boson in intensity frontier experiments."

To address this problem, this paper proposes a compressive sensing (CS)-based CE solution for IRS-aided mmWave massive MIMO systems, whereby the angular channel sparsity of large-scale array at mmWave is exploited for improved CE with reduced pilot overhead. Specifically, we first propose a downlink pilot transmission framework. By designing the pilot signals based on the prior knowledge that the line-of-sight dominated BS-to-IRS channel is known, the high-dimensional channels for BS-to-user and IRS-to-user can be jointly estimated based on CS theory. Moreover, to efficiently estimate broadband channels, a distributed orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is exploited, where the common sparsity shared by the channels at different subcarriers is utilized. Additionally, the redundant dictionary to combat the power leakage is also designed for the enhanced CE performance. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."

Thus, the model supports only general relativity solutions. We also show that, when the cosmological constant vanishes and the gradient of the CS scalar field is parallel to the non-null hypersurface orthogonal Killing vector of constant length, CS modified gravity reduces to topologically massive gravity in three dimensions. Meanwhile, with the cosmological constant such a reduction requires an appropriate source term for CS modified gravity."

To achieve this, we establish a general paradigm for applying noisy student training (NST) to the CS-ASR task. Specifically, we introduce the LLM-Filter, which leverages well-designed prompt templates to activate the correction capability of large language models (LLMs) for monolingual data selection and pseudo-labels refinement during NST. Our experiments on the supervised ASRU-CS and unsupervised AISHELL-2 and LibriSpeech datasets show that our method not only achieves significant improvements over supervised and semi-supervised learning baselines for the CS task, but also attains better performance compared with the fully-supervised oracle upper-bound on the CS English part. Additionally, we further investigate the influence of accent on AESRC dataset and demonstrate that our method can get achieve additional benefits when the monolingual data contains relevant linguistic characteristic."

    "title": "Compressive Fluorescence Microscopy for Biological and Hyperspectral Imaging",
    "summary": "The mathematical theory of compressed sensing (CS) asserts that one can acquire signals from measurements whose rate is much lower than the total bandwidth. Whereas the CS theory is now well developed, challenges concerning hardware implementations of CS-based acquisition devices---especially in optics---have only started being addressed. This paper presents an implementation of compressive sensing in fluorescence microscopy and its applications to biomedical imaging. Our CS microscope combines a dynamic structured wide-field illumination and a fast and sensitive single-point fluorescence detection to enable reconstructions of images of fluorescent beads, cells and tissues with undersampling ratios (between the number of pixels and number of measurements) up to 32. We further demonstrate a hyperspectral mode and record images with 128 spectral channels and undersampling ratios up to 64, illustrating the potential benefits of CS acquisition for higher dimensional signals which typically exhibits extreme redundancy. Altogether, our results emphasize the interest of CS schemes for acquisition at a significantly reduced rate and point out to some remaining challenges for CS fluorescence microscopy."

    "summary": "In future wireless networks, one fundamental challenge for massive machine-type communications (mMTC) lies in the reliable support of massive connectivity with low latency. Against this background, this paper proposes a compressive sensing (CS)-based massive random access scheme for mMTC by leveraging the inherent sporadic traffic, where both the active devices and their channels can be jointly estimated with low overhead. Specifically, we consider devices in the uplink massive random access adopt pseudo random pilots, which are designed under the framework of CS theory. Meanwhile, the massive random access at the base stations (BS) can be formulated as the sparse signal recovery problem by leveraging the sparse nature of active devices. Moreover, by exploiting the structured sparsity among different receiver antennas and subcarriers, we develop a distributed multiple measurement vector approximate message passing (DMMV-AMP) algorithm for further improved performance. Additionally, the state evolution (SE) of the proposed DMMV-AMP algorithm is derived to predict the performance. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme, which exhibits a good tightness with the theoretical SE."

    "summary": "A vast population of low-cost low-power transmitters sporadically sending small amounts of data over a common wireless medium is one of the main scenarios for Internet of things (IoT) data communications. At the medium access, the use of grant-free solutions may be preferred to reduce overhead even at the cost of multiple-access interference. Unsourced multiple access (UMA) has been recently established as relevant framework for energy efficient grant-free protocols. The use of a compressed sensing (CS) transmission phase is key in one of the two main classes of UMA protocols, yet little attention has been posed to sparse greedy algorithms as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and its variants. We analyze their performance and provide relevant guidance on how to optimally setup the CS phase. Minimum average transmission power and minimum number of channel uses are investigated together with the performance in terms of receiver operating characteristic (ROC). Interestingly, we show how the basic OMP and generalized OMP (gOMP) are the most competitive algorithms in their class."

    "summary": "Owing to the widespread adoption of the Internet of Things, a vast amount of sensor information is being acquired in real time. Accordingly, the communication cost of data from edge devices is increasing. Compressed sensing (CS), a data compression method that can be used on edge devices, has been attracting attention as a method to reduce communication costs. In CS, estimating the appropriate compression ratio is important. There is a method to adaptively estimate the compression ratio for the acquired data using reinforcement learning (RL). However, the computational costs associated with existing RL methods that can be utilized on edges are often high. In this study, we developed an efficient RL method for edge devices, referred to as the actor--critic online sequential extreme learning machine (AC-OSELM), and a system to compress data by estimating an appropriate compression ratio on the edge using AC-OSELM. The performance of the proposed method in estimating the compression ratio is evaluated by comparing it with other RL methods for edge devices. The experimental results indicate that AC-OSELM demonstrated the same or better compression performance and faster compression ratio estimation than the existing methods."

    "summary": "Interest in computer science is growing. As a result, computer science (CS) and related departments are experiencing an explosive increase in undergraduate enrollments and unprecedented demand from other disciplines for learning computing. According to the 2014 CRA Taulbee Survey, the number of undergraduates declaring a computing major at Ph.D. granting departments in the US has increased 60% from 2011-2014 and the number of degrees granted has increased by 34% from 2008-2013. However, this growth is not limited to higher education. New York City, San Francisco and Oakland public schools will soon be offering computer science to all students at all schools from preschool to 12th grade, although it will be an elective for high school students. This unprecedented demand means that CS departments are likely to teach not only more students in the coming decades, but more diverse students, with more varied backgrounds, motivations, preparations, and abilities. This growth is an unparalleled opportunity to expand the reach of computing education. However, this growth is also a unique research challenge, as we know very little about how best to teach our current students, let alone the students soon to arrive. The burgeoning field of Computing Education Research (CER) is positioned to address this challenge by answering research questions such as, how should we teach computer science, from programming to advanced principles, to a broader and more diverse audience? We argue that computer science departments should lead the way in establishing CER as a foundational research area of computer science, discovering the best ways to teach CS, and inventing the best technologies with which to teach it. This white paper provides a snapshot of the current state of CER and makes actionable recommendations for academic leaders to grow CER as a successful research area in their departments."

However, existing methods assume a reliable and unbiased forecasting environment, which is not always available in the wild. In this work, we investigate the vulnerability of spatiotemporal traffic forecasting models and propose a practical adversarial spatiotemporal attack framework. Specifically, instead of simultaneously attacking all geo-distributed data sources, an iterative gradient-guided node saliency method is proposed to identify the time-dependent set of victim nodes. Furthermore, we devise a spatiotemporal gradient descent based scheme to generate real-valued adversarial traffic states under a perturbation constraint. Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the worst performance bound of adversarial traffic forecasting attacks. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that the proposed two-step framework achieves up to performance degradation on various advanced spatiotemporal forecasting models. Remarkably, we also show that adversarial training with our proposed attacks can significantly improve the robustness of spatiotemporal traffic forecasting models.

In many CS applications, such as electromagnetic imaging, practical limitations on the measurement system prevent one from generating sensing matrices in this fashion. Although one can usually randomized the measurements to some degree, these sensing matrices do not achieve the same reconstruction performance as the truly randomized sensing matrices. In this paper, we present a novel method, based upon capacity maximization, for designing sensing matrices with enhanced block-sparse signal reconstruction capabilities. Through several numerical examples, we demonstrate how our method significantly enhances reconstruction performance."

The ultimate aim of such endeavors is to develop a universal model that can predict products for any chemical reaction given reactants and physical conditions. In pursuit of ever more universal chemical predictors, machine learning models for atom-diatom and diatom-diatom reactions have been developed, yet no such models exist for termolecular reactions. Accordingly, we introduce neural networks trained to predict opacity functions of atom recombination reactions. Our models predict the recombination of Sr + Cs + Cs SrCs + Cs and Sr + Cs + Cs Cs + Sr over multiple orders of magnitude of energy, yielding overall results with a relative error . Even far beyond the range of energies seen during training, our models predict the atom recombination reaction rate accurately. As a result, the machine is capable of learning the physics behind the atom recombination reaction dynamics."

During the training phase, the sensing matrix and the non-linear reconstruction operator are jointly optimized using Structural similarity index (SSIM) as loss rather than the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss. We compare the proposed approach with state-of-the-art in terms of reconstruction quality under both losses, i.e. SSIM score and MSE score."

    "summary": "This paper proposes a novel electric vehicle (EV) classification scheme for a photovoltaic (PV) powered EV charging station (CS) that reduces the effect of intermittency of electricity supply as well as reducing the cost of energy trading of the CS. Since not all EV drivers would like to be environmentally friendly, all vehicles in the CS are divided into three categories: 1) premium, 2) conservative, and 3) green, according to their charging behavior. Premium and conservative EVs are considered to be interested only in charging their batteries, with noticeably higher rate of charging for premium EVs. Green vehicles are more environmentally friendly, and thus assist the CS to reduce its cost of energy trading by allowing the CS to use their batteries as distributed storage. A different charging scheme is proposed for each type of EV, which is adopted by the CS to encourage more EVs to be green. A basic mixed integer programming (MIP) technique is used to facilitate the proposed classification scheme. It is shown that the uncertainty in PV generation can be effectively compensated, along with minimization of total cost of energy trading to the CS, by consolidating more green EVs. Real solar and pricing data are used for performance analysis of the system. It is demonstrated that the total cost to the CS reduces considerably as the percentage of green vehicles increases, and also that the contributions of green EVs in winter are greater than those in summer."

Here we extend that approach to any SU(l,1) group and construct explicitly corresponding CS. The CS are parametrized by dots of a coset space, which is, in that particular case, the open complex ball . This space together with the projective space , which parametrizes CS of the SU(l+1) group, exhausts all complex spaces of constant curvature. Thus, both sets of CS provide a possibility for an explicit analysis of the quantization problem on all the spaces of constant curvature."

The Kraus form ensures that the reconstructed process is completely positive. To make the process trace-preserving, we use a constrained gradient-descent (GD) approach on the so-called Stiefel manifold during optimization to obtain the Kraus operators. Our ansatz uses a few Kraus operators to avoid direct estimation of large process matrices, e.g., the Choi matrix, for low-rank quantum processes. The GD-QPT matches the performance of both compressed-sensing (CS) and projected least-squares (PLS) QPT in benchmarks with two-qubit random processes, but shines by combining the best features of these two methods. Similar to CS (but unlike PLS), GD-QPT can reconstruct a process from just a small number of random measurements, and similar to PLS (but unlike CS) it also works for larger system sizes, up to at least five qubits. We envisage that the data-driven approach of GD-QPT can become a practical tool that greatly reduces the cost and computational effort for QPT in intermediate-scale quantum systems."

Specifically, we consider two variants of the so-called CS problem. The goal of the first problem, which is called the exact CS problem, is to steer the mean and the covariance of the state process to their desired values in finite time. In the second one, which is called the ``relaxed'' CS problem, the covariance assignment constraint is relaxed into a positive semi-definite constraint. We show that the relaxed CS problem can be cast as an equivalent convex semi-definite program (SDP) after applying suitable variable transformations and constraint relaxations. Furthermore, we propose a two-step solution procedure for the exact CS problem based on the relaxed problem formulation which returns a feasible solution, if there exists one. Finally, results from numerical experiments are provided to show the efficacy of the proposed solution methods."

    "title": "Sampling and Reconstruction of Sparse Signals in Shift-Invariant Spaces: Generalized Shannon's Theorem Meets Compressive Sensing",
    "summary": "This paper introduces a novel framework and corresponding methods for sampling and reconstruction of sparse signals in shift-invariant (SI) spaces. We reinterpret the random demodulator, a system that acquires sparse bandlimited signals, as a system for the acquisition of linear combinations of the samples in the SI setting with the box function as the sampling kernel. The sparsity assumption is exploited by the compressive sensing (CS) paradigm for a recovery of the SI samples from a reduced set of measurements. The SI samples are subsequently filtered by a discrete-time correction filter to reconstruct expansion coefficients of the observed signal. Furthermore, we offer a generalization of the proposed framework to other compactly supported sampling kernels that span a wider class of SI spaces. The generalized method embeds the correction filter in the CS optimization problem which directly reconstructs expansion coefficients of the signal. Both approaches recast an inherently continuous-domain inverse problem in a set of finite-dimensional CS problems in an exact way. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments on signals in polynomial B-spline spaces whose expansion coefficients are assumed to be sparse in a certain transform domain. The coefficients can be regarded as parametric models of an underlying continuous-time signal, obtained from a reduced set of measurements. Such continuous signal representations are particularly suitable for signal processing without converting them into samples."

Second, how can we track current and emerging trends to capture relevant competencies? We argue a study of the scholarly literature will have a limited impact on our understanding of current and emerging trends and curriculum designers would do well to utilize GL.

We show that the partitioning rule without losing the feature of being a CS coincides with the non-squashing partitions of a positive integer and leads to a symmetric separation of clusters. We analytically derive the number of partitioned CSs for given bandwidth and a minimum distance constraint and obtain the corresponding recursive methods for enumerating the values of separations. We show that partitioning can increase the spectral efficiency (SE) without changing the alphabet of the nonzero elements of the CS, i.e., standard CSs relying on Reed-Muller (RM) code. We also develop an encoder for partitioned CSs and a maximum-likelihood-based recursive decoder for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and fading channels. Our results indicate that the partitioned CSs under a minimum distance constraint can perform similar to the standard CSs in terms of average block error rate (BLER) and provide a higher SE at the expense of a limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss."

The problem of completion time minimization for FL is tackled by optimizing the rate-splitting transmission and fronthaul quantization strategies along with training hyperparameters such as precision and iteration numbers. Numerical results show that the proposed rate-splitting transmission achieves notable gains over benchmark schemes which rely solely on edge or cloud decoding."

Here we demonstrate another method of cooling ions that is based on resonant charge exchange (RCE) between the trapped ion and the ultracold parent atom. Specifically, trapped Cs ions are cooled by collisions with co-trapped, ultracold Cs atoms and, separately, by collisions with co-trapped, ultracold Rb atoms. We observe that the cooling of Cs ions by Cs atoms is more efficient than cooling of Cs ions by Rb atoms. This signals the presence of a cooling mechanism apart from the elastic ion-atom collision channel for the Cs-Cs case, which is cooling by RCE. The efficiency of cooling by RCE is experimentally determined and the per-collision cooling is found to be two orders of magnitude higher than cooling by EC. The result provides the experimental basis for future studies on charge transport by electron hopping in atom-ion hybrid systems."

[Question/Problem] We address the challenge of SoS requirements specification, where requirements can describe the SoS behavior, but also the behavior of CSs that are developed independently. [Principal Ideas] To support the requirements specification in an SoS environment, we propose a scenario-based and iterative specification technique. This allows requirements engineers to continuously model and jointly execute and test the system behavior for the SoS and the CS in order to detect contradictions in the requirement specifications at an early stage. [Contribution] In this paper, we describe an extension for the scenario-modeling language for Kotlin (SMLK) to continuously and formally model requirements on SoS and CS level. To support the iterative requirements specification and modeling we combine SMLK with agile development techniques.

To achieve such an ambitious goal, new mechanisms for foreign pronunciation generation and language model (LM) enrichment have been devised. Specifically, we have designed an automatic approach to obtain high quality pronunciation of foreign language (FL) words in the native language (NL) phoneme set using existing acoustic phone decoders and an LSTM-based grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model. Improved accented pronunciations have thus been obtained by learning foreign pronunciations directly from data. Furthermore, a code-switching LM was deployed by converting the original NL LM into a CS LM using translated word pairs and borrowing statistics for the NL LM. Experimental evidence clearly demonstrates that our approach better deals with accented foreign pronunciations than techniques based on human labeling. Moreover, our best system achieves a 55.5% relative word error rate reduction from 34.4%, obtained with a conventional monolingual ASR system, to 15.3% on an intra-sentential CS task without harming the monolingual recognition accuracy."

    "summary": "Recently, deep learning approaches have been extensively investigated to reconstruct images from accelerated magnetic resonance image (MRI) acquisition. Although these approaches provide significant performance gain compared to compressed sensing MRI (CS-MRI), it is not clear how to choose a suitable network architecture to balance the trade-off between network complexity and performance. Recently, it was shown that an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN) can be interpreted as a piecewise linear basis-like representation, whose specific representation is determined by the ReLU activation patterns for a given input image. Thus, the expressivity or the representation power is determined by the number of piecewise linear regions. As an extension of this geometric understanding, this paper proposes a systematic geometric approach using bootstrapping and subnetwork aggregation using an attention module to increase the expressivity of the underlying neural network. Our method can be implemented in both k-space domain and image domain that can be trained in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results show that the proposed schemes significantly improve reconstruction performance with negligible complexity increases."

We also derive, for the first time, a backpropagation rule, which is applicable to train any algorithm that implements a sparse code recovery layer. The key observation behind our algorithm is that cell detection task is a point object detection task in computer vision, where the cell centers (i.e., point objects) occupy only a tiny fraction of the total number of pixels in an image. Thus, we can apply compressed sensing (or, equivalently sparse coding) to compactly represent a variable number of cells in a projected space. Then, CNN regresses this compressed vector from the input microscopy image. Thanks to the SC/CS recovery algorithm (L1 optimization) that can recover sparse cell locations from the output of CNN. We train this entire processing pipeline end-to-end and demonstrate that end-to-end training provides accuracy improvements over a training paradigm that treats CNN and CS-recovery layers separately. Our algorithm design also takes into account a form of ensemble average of trained models naturally to further boost accuracy of cell detection.

More specifically, we cast the problem of user identification and CSI estimation as a block sparse signal recovery problem in compressive sensing (CS). Using existing CS block recovery algorithms, we first obtain the identity of the strong users and then estimate their CSI using the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE). To minimize the effect of noise on the estimated CSI, we introduce a back-off strategy that optimally backs-off on the noisy estimated CSI and derive the error covariance matrix of the post-detection noise. In addition to this, we provide exact closed form expressions for the average maximum equivalent SNR at the destination user. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm drastically reduces the feedback air-time and achieves a rate close to that obtained by scheduling schemes that require dedicated error-free feedback from all the network users."

CS forms are also the natural generalization of the minimal coupling between the electromagnetic field and a point charge when the source is not point-like but an extended fundamental object, a membrane. They are found in relation with anomalies in quantum field theories, and as Lagrangians for gauge fields, including gravity and supergravity. A cursory review of the role of CS forms in gravitation theories is presented at an introductory level."

    "summary": "Massive machine-type communication (mMTC) is a newly introduced service category in 5G wireless communication systems to support a variety of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. In recovering sparsely represented multi-user vectors, compressed sensing based multi-user detection (CS-MUD) can be used. CS-MUD is a feasible solution to the grant-free uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) environments. In CS-MUD, active user detection (AUD) and channel estimation (CE) should be performed before data detection. In this paper, we propose the expectation propagation based joint AUD and CE (EP-AUD/CE) technique for mMTC networks. The expectation propagation (EP) algorithm is a Bayesian framework that approximates a computationally intractable probability distribution to an easily tractable distribution. The proposed technique finds the best approximation of the posterior distribution of the sparse channel vector. Using the approximate distribution, AUD and CE are jointly performed. We show by numerical simulations that the proposed technique substantially enhances AUD and CE performances over competing algorithms."

    "title": "Clinically Deployed Distributed Magnetic Resonance Imaging Reconstruction: Application to Pediatric Knee Imaging",
    "summary": "Magnetic resonance imaging is capable of producing volumetric images without ionizing radiation. Nonetheless, long acquisitions lead to prohibitively long exams. Compressed sensing (CS) can enable faster scanning via sub-sampling with reduced artifacts. However, CS requires significantly higher reconstruction computation, limiting current clinical applications to 2D/3D or limited-resolution dynamic imaging. Here we analyze the practical limitations to T2 Shuffling, a four-dimensional CS-based acquisition, which provides sharp 3D-isotropic-resolution and multi-contrast images in a single scan. Our improvements to the pipeline on a single machine provide a 3x overall reconstruction speedup, which allowed us to add algorithmic changes improving image quality. Using four machines, we achieved additional 2.1x improvement through distributed parallelization. Our solution reduced the reconstruction time in the hospital to 90 seconds on a 4-node cluster, enabling its use clinically. To understand the implications of scaling this application, we simulated running our reconstructions with a multiple scanner setup typical in hospitals."

    "title": "Incentives for Early Arrival in Cost Sharing",
    "summary": "In cooperative games, we study how values created or costs incurred by a coalition are shared among the members within it, and the players may join the coalition in a online manner such as investors invest a startup. Recently, Ge et al. [10] proposed a new property called incentives for early arrival (I4EA) in such games, which says that the online allocation of values or costs should incentivize agents to join early in order to prevent mutual strategic waiting. Ideally, the allocation should also be fair, so that agents arriving in an order uniformly at random should expect to get/pay their Shapley values. Ge et al. [10] showed that not all monotone value functions admit such mechanisms in online value sharing games. In this work, we show a sharp contrast in online cost sharing games. We construct a mechanism with all the properties mentioned above, for every monotone cost function. To achieve this, we first solve 0-1 valued cost sharing games with a novel mechanism called Shapley-fair shuffle cost sharing mechanism (SFS-CS), and then extend SFS-CS to a family called generalized Shapley-fair shuffle cost sharing mechanisms (GSFS-CS). The critical technique we invented here is a mapping from one arrival order to another order so that we can directly apply marginal cost allocation on the shuffled orders to satisfy the properties. Finally, we solve general valued cost functions, by decomposing them into 0-1 valued functions in an online fashion."

    "summary": "The broad adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) is impacting Computer Science education, and recent studies found its benefits and potential concerns when students use it for programming learning. However, most existing explorations focus on GenAI tools that primarily support text-to-text interaction. With recent developments, GenAI applications have begun supporting multiple modes of communication, known as multimodality. In this work, we explored how undergraduate programming novices choose and work with multimodal GenAI tools, and their criteria for choices. We selected a commercially available multimodal GenAI platform for interaction, as it supports multiple input and output modalities, including text, audio, image upload, and real-time screen-sharing. Through 16 think-aloud sessions that combined participant observation with follow-up semi-structured interviews, we investigated student modality choices for GenAI tools when completing programming problems and the underlying criteria for modality selections. With multimodal communication emerging as the future of AI in education, this work aims to spark continued exploration on understanding student interaction with multimodal GenAI in the context of CS education."

    "title": "Multichannel Compressive Sensing MRI Using Noiselet Encoding",
    "summary": "The incoherence between measurement and sparsifying transform matrices and the restricted isometry property (RIP) of measurement matrix are two of the key factors in determining the performance of compressive sensing (CS). In CS-MRI, the randomly under-sampled Fourier matrix is used as the measurement matrix and the wavelet transform is usually used as sparsifying transform matrix. However, the incoherence between the randomly under-sampled Fourier matrix and the wavelet matrix is not optimal, which can deteriorate the performance of CS-MRI. Using the mathematical result that noiselets are maximally incoherent with wavelets, this paper introduces the noiselet unitary bases as the measurement matrix to improve the incoherence and RIP in CS-MRI, and presents a method to design the pulse sequence for the noiselet encoding. This novel encoding scheme is combined with the multichannel compressive sensing (MCS) framework to take the advantage of multichannel data acquisition used in MRI scanners. An empirical RIP analysis is presented to compare the multichannel noiselet and multichannel Fourier measurement matrices in MCS. Simulations are presented in the MCS framework to compare the performance of noiselet encoding reconstructions and Fourier encoding reconstructions at different acceleration factors. The comparisons indicate that multichannel noiselet measurement matrix has better RIP than that of its Fourier counterpart, and that noiselet encoded MCS-MRI outperforms Fourier encoded MCS-MRI in preserving image resolution and can achieve higher acceleration factors. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed noiselet encoding scheme, two pulse sequences with tailored spatially selective RF excitation pulses was designed and implemented on a 3T scanner to acquire the data in the noiselet domain from a phantom and a human brain."

To address this issue, we propose a novel Interweaved Graph and Attention Network (IGANet) that allows bidirectional communications between graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and attentions. Specifically, we introduce an IGA module, where attentions are provided with local information from GCNs and GCNs are injected with global information from attentions. Additionally, we design a simple yet effective U-shaped multi-layer perceptron (uMLP), which can capture multi-granularity information for body joints. Extensive experiments on two popular benchmark datasets (i.e. Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) are conducted to evaluate our proposed method.The results show that IGANet achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.

Whereas GWs propagate at the speed of light, c, in CS gravity, we point out that this is specific to CS gravity and the GW propagation speed deviates from c, in general, in parity-violating gravity. Therefore, contrary to the previous literature in which only CS gravity is studied as a concrete example, we show that GW170817/GRB 170817A can, in fact, be used to limit gravitational parity violation. Our argument implies that the constraint on the propagation speed of GWs can pin down the parity-violating sector, if any, to CS gravity."

It was proposed that group I elements like Cs can be oxidized further under high pressure. Here we perform a comprehensive study for the CsF-F system at pressures up to 100 GPa, and find extremely versatile chemistry. A series of CsF ( 1) compounds are predicted to be stable already at ambient pressure. Under pressure, 5 electrons in Cs atoms become active, with growing tendency to form Cs and Cs valence states at fluorine-rich conditions. Although Cs and Cs are not energetically favoured, the interplay between two mechanisms (polyfluoride anions and polyvalent Cs cations) allows CsF and CsF compounds to be stable under pressure. The estimated defluorination temperatures of CsF (n=2,3,5) compounds at atmospheric pressure (218 C, 150 C, -15 C, respectively), are attractive for fluorine storage applications."

In September 2023, CHEOPS completed its nominal mission and remains in excellent operational conditions. The mission has been extended until the end of 2026. Scientific and instrumental data have been collected throughout in-orbit commissioning and nominal operations, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the mission's performance. In this article, we present the results of this analysis with a twofold goal. First, we aim to inform the scientific community about the present status of the mission and what can be expected as the instrument ages. Secondly, we intend for this publication to serve as a legacy document for future missions, providing insights and lessons learned from the successful operation of CHEOPS. To evaluate the instrument performance in flight, we developed a comprehensive monitoring and characterisation programme. It consists of dedicated observations that allow us to characterise the instrument's response. In addition to the standard collection of nominal science and housekeeping data, these observations provide input for detecting, modelling, and correcting instrument systematics, discovering and addressing anomalies, and comparing the instrument's actual performance with expectations. The precision of the CHEOPS measurements has enabled the mission objectives to be met and exceeded. Careful modelling of the instrumental systematics allows the data quality to be significantly improved during the light curve analysis phase, resulting in more precise scientific measurements. CHEOPS is compliant with the driving scientific requirements of the mission. Although visible, the ageing of the instrument has not affected the mission's performance."

We show that a known collective field description of the CS model, which is based on conformal field theory (CFT), is actually a collective field description of the deformed CS model. This provides a natural application of the deformed CS model in Wen's effective field theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), with the two kinds of particles corresponding to electrons and quasi-hole excitations. In particular, we use known mathematical results about super Jack polynomials to obtain simple explicit formulas for the orthonormal CFT basis proposed by van Elburg and Schoutens in the context of the FQHE."

    "title": "Channel Estimation for Underwater Visible Light Communication: A Sparse Learning Perspective",
    "summary": "The underwater propagation environment for visible light signals is affected by complex factors such as absorption, shadowing, and reflection, making it very challengeable to achieve effective underwater visible light communication (UVLC) channel estimation. It is difficult for the UVLC channel to be sparse represented in the time and frequency domains, which limits the chance of using sparse signal processing techniques to achieve better performance of channel estimation. To this end, a compressed sensing (CS) based framework is established in this paper by fully exploiting the sparsity of the underwater visible light channel in the distance domain of the propagation links. In order to solve the sparse recovery problem and achieve more accurate UVLC channel estimation, a sparse learning based underwater visible light channel estimation (SL-UVCE) scheme is proposed. Specifically, a deep-unfolding neural network mimicking the classical iterative sparse recovery algorithm of approximate message passing (AMP) is employed, which decomposes the iterations of AMP into a series of layers with different learnable parameters. Compared with the existing non-CS-based and CS-based schemes, the proposed scheme shows better performance of accuracy in channel estimation, especially in severe conditions such as insufficient measurement pilots and large number of multipath components."

Moreover, we aim to model the changing trends of the connections, such as \"cnn\" becomes highly related to \"imagenet\" after 2010, which enables the tracking of knowledge evolutions.

    "title": "Enhanced Compressive Wideband Frequency Spectrum Sensing for Dynamic Spectrum Access",
    "summary": "Wideband spectrum sensing detects the unused spectrum holes for dynamic spectrum access (DSA). Too high sampling rate is the main problem. Compressive sensing (CS) can reconstruct sparse signal with much fewer randomized samples than Nyquist sampling with high probability. Since survey shows that the monitored signal is sparse in frequency domain, CS can deal with the sampling burden. Random samples can be obtained by the analog-to-information converter. Signal recovery can be formulated as an L0 norm minimization and a linear measurement fitting constraint. In DSA, the static spectrum allocation of primary radios means the bounds between different types of primary radios are known in advance. To incorporate this a priori information, we divide the whole spectrum into subsections according to the spectrum allocation policy. In the new optimization model, the minimization of the L2 norm of each subsection is used to encourage the cluster distribution locally, while the L0 norm of the L2 norms is minimized to give sparse distribution globally. Because the L0/L2 optimization is not convex, an iteratively re-weighted L1/L2 optimization is proposed to approximate it. Simulations demonstrate the proposed method outperforms others in accuracy, denoising ability, etc."

However, due to the insufficient number of projection views, an analytic reconstruction approach results in severe streaking artifacts and CS-based iterative approach is computationally very expensive. To address this issue, here we propose a novel deep residual learning approach for sparse view CT reconstruction. Specifically, based on a novel persistent homology analysis showing that the manifold of streaking artifacts is topologically simpler than original ones, a deep residual learning architecture that estimates the streaking artifacts is developed. Once a streaking artifact image is estimated, an artifact-free image can be obtained by subtracting the streaking artifacts from the input image. Using extensive experiments with real patient data set, we confirm that the proposed residual learning provides significantly better image reconstruction performance with several orders of magnitude faster computational speed."

During the phases of VoLTE deployments, carriers would typically face challenges in understanding the factors affecting the VoLTE performance and then optimizing it to meet or exceed the performance of the legacy circuit switched (CS) network (i.e., 2G/3G). The main challenge of VoLTE service quality is the LTE network optimization and the performance aspects of the service in different LTE deployment scenarios. In this paper, we present a detailed practical performance analysis of VoLTE based on commercially deployed 3GPP Release-10 LTE networks. The analysis evaluates VoLTE performance in terms of real-time transport protocol (RTP) error rate, RTP jitter and delays, block error rate (BLER) in different radio conditions and VoLTE voice quality in terms of mean opinion score (MOS). In addition, the paper evaluates key VoLTE features such as RObust Header Compression (ROHC) and transmission time interval (TTI) bundling. This paper provides guidelines for best practices of VoLTE deployment as well as practical performance evaluation based on field measurement data from commercial LTE networks."

In order to face the problem, the use of sound features to reason on the system from data processing is a key step. In the specific case of complex societal systems, sentiment analysis allows to mirror (part of) the affective dimension. However it is not reasonable to think that individual sentiment categorization can encompass the new affective phenomena in digital social networks. The present papers addresses the problem of isolating sentiment concepts which emerge in social networks. In an analogy to Artificial Intelligent Singularity, we propose the study and analysis of these new complex sentiment structures and how they are similar to or diverge from classic conceptual structures associated to sentiment lexicons. The conjecture is that it is highly probable that hypercomplex sentiment structures -not explained with human categorizations- emerge from high dynamic social information networks. Roughly speaking, new sentiment can emerge from the new global nervous systems as it occurs in humans."

We prove that this structure satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP) with high probability if the number of measurements for -sparse signals of length and if the column-wise orthonormal matrix is bounded. Some existing structured sensing models can be studied under this framework, which then gives tighter bounds on the required number of measurements to satisfy the RIP. More importantly, we propose several structured sensing models by appealing to this unified framework, such as a general sensing model with arbitrary/determinisic subsamplers, a fast and efficient block compressed sensing scheme, and structured sensing matrices with deterministic phase modulations, all of which can lead to improvements on practical applications. In particular, one of the constructions is applied to simplify the transceiver design of CS-based channel estimation for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems."

In the meanwhile, when compared with the spots at the same position in the simulated maps, the values of local variance and skewness around CS are all systematically larger in the scale of , which implies that WMAP CS is a large-scale non-Gaussian structure, rather than a combination of some small structures. This is consistent with the finding that the non-Gaussianity of CS is totally encoded in the WMAP low multipoles. Furthermore, we find that the cosmic texture can excellently explain all the anomalies in these statistics."

    "title": "Accelerating CS in Parallel Imaging Reconstructions Using an Efficient and Effective Circulant Preconditioner",
    "summary": "Purpose: Design of a preconditioner for fast and efficient parallel imaging and compressed sensing reconstructions. Theory: Parallel imaging and compressed sensing reconstructions become time consuming when the problem size or the number of coils is large, due to the large linear system of equations that has to be solved in l_1 and l_2-norm based reconstruction algorithms. Such linear systems can be solved efficiently using effective preconditioning techniques. Methods: In this paper we construct such a preconditioner by approximating the system matrix of the linear system, which comprises the data fidelity and includes total variation and wavelet regularization, by a matrix with the assumption that is a block circulant matrix with circulant blocks. Due to its circulant structure, the preconditioner can be constructed quickly and its inverse can be evaluated fast using only two fast Fourier transformations. We test the performance of the preconditioner for the conjugate gradient method as the linear solver, integrated into the Split Bregman algorithm. Results: The designed circulant preconditioner reduces the number of iterations required in the conjugate gradient method by almost a factor of~5. The speed up results in a total acceleration factor of approximately 2.5 for the entire reconstruction algorithm when implemented in MATLAB, while the initialization time of the preconditioner is negligible. Conclusion: The proposed preconditioner reduces the reconstruction time for parallel imaging and compressed sensing in a Split Bregman implementation and can easily handle large systems since it is Fourier-based, allowing for efficient computations.

    "summary": "The fact that the millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel has sparse support in the spatial domain has motivated recent compressed sensing (CS)-based mmWave channel estimation methods, where the angles of arrivals (AoAs) and angles of departures (AoDs) are quantized using angle dictionary matrices. However, the existing CS-based methods usually obtain the estimation result through one-stage channel sounding that have two limitations: (i) the requirement of large-dimensional dictionary and (ii) unresolvable quantization error. These two drawbacks are irreconcilable; improvement of the one implies deterioration of the other. To address these challenges, we propose, in this paper, a two-stage method to estimate the AoAs and AoDs of mmWave channels. In the proposed method, the channel estimation task is divided into two stages, Stage I and Stage II. Specifically, in Stage I, the AoAs are estimated by solving a multiple measurement vectors (MMV) problem. In Stage II, based on the estimated AoAs, the receive sounders are designed to estimate AoDs. The dimension of the angle dictionary in each stage can be reduced, which in turn reduces the computational complexity substantially. We then analyze the successful recovery probability (SRP) of the proposed method, revealing the superiority of the proposed framework over the existing one-stage CS-based methods. We further enhance the reconstruction performance by performing resource allocation between the two stages. We also overcome the unresolvable quantization error issue present in the prior techniques by applying the atomic norm minimization method to each stage of the proposed two-stage approach. The simulation results illustrate the substantially improved performance with low complexity of the proposed two-stage method."

Recent attention on synchronization is focused on the chimera state (CS) and explosive synchronization (ES), but little attention has been paid to their relationship. We here study this topic by presenting a model to bridge these two phenomena, which consists of two groups of coupled oscillators and its coupling strength is adaptively controlled by a local order parameter. We find that this model displays either CS or ES in two limits. In between the two limits, this model exhibits both CS and ES, where CS can be observed for a fixed coupling strength and ES appears when the coupling is increased adiabatically. Moreover, we show both theoretically and numerically that there are a variety of CS basin patterns for the case of identical oscillators, depending on the distributions of both the initial order parameters and the initial average phases. This model suggests a way to easily observe CS, in contrast to others models having some (weak or strong) dependence on initial conditions."

    "summary": "In an X-ray reflection spectrum, a tail-like spectral feature generated via Compton down-scattering, known as a Compton shoulder (CS), appears at the low-energy side of the iron K line. Despite its great diagnostic potential, its use as a spectral probe of the reflector has been seriously limited due to observational difficulties and modelling complexities. We revisit the basic nature of the CS by systematic investigation into its dependence on spatial and temporal parameters. The calculations are performed by Monte-Carlo simulations for sphere and slab geometries. The dependence is obtained in a two-dimensional space of column density and metal abundance, demonstrating that the CS solves parameter degeneration between them which was seen in conventional spectral analysis using photoelectric absorption and fluorescence lines. Unlike the iron line, the CS does not suffer from any observational dependence on the spectral hardness. The CS profile is highly dependent on the inclination angle of the slab geometry unless the slab is Compton-thick, and the time evolution of the CS is shown to be useful to constrain temporal information on the source if the intrinsic radiation is variable. We also discuss how atomic binding of the scattering electrons in cold matter blurs the CS profile, finding that the effect is practically similar to thermal broadening in a plasma with a moderate temperature of 5 eV. Spectral diagnostics using the CS is demonstrated with grating data of X-ray binary GX 301 2, and will be available in future with high-resolution spectra of active galactic nuclei obtained by microcalorimeters."

In detail, this paper first proposes an algorithm to generate a 2D key which depends on the physical property of communication channels.

To fully exploit the impacts of interactions, this paper proposes a ego-planning guided multi-graph convolutional network (EPG-MGCN) to predict the trajectories of heterogeneous agents using both historical trajectory information and ego vehicle's future planning information. The EPG-MGCN first models the social interactions by employing four graph topologies, i.e., distance graphs, visibility graphs, planning graphs and category graphs. Then, the planning information of the ego vehicle is encoded by both the planning graph and the subsequent planning-guided prediction module to reduce uncertainty in the trajectory prediction. Finally, a category-specific gated recurrent unit (CS-GRU) encoder-decoder is designed to generate future trajectories for each specific type of agents. Our network is evaluated on two real-world trajectory datasets: ApolloScape and NGSIM. The experimental results show that the proposed EPG-MGCN achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods."

    "title": "Compressive and Noncompressive Power Spectral Density Estimation from Periodic Nonuniform Samples",
    "summary": "This paper presents a novel power spectral density estimation technique for band-limited, wide-sense stationary signals from sub-Nyquist sampled data. The technique employs multi-coset sampling and incorporates the advantages of compressed sensing (CS) when the power spectrum is sparse, but applies to sparse and nonsparse power spectra alike. The estimates are consistent piecewise constant approximations whose resolutions (width of the piecewise constant segments) are controlled by the periodicity of the multi-coset sampling. We show that compressive estimates exhibit better tradeoffs among the estimator's resolution, system complexity, and average sampling rate compared to their noncompressive counterparts. For suitable sampling patterns, noncompressive estimates are obtained as least squares solutions. Because of the non-negativity of power spectra, compressive estimates can be computed by seeking non-negative least squares solutions (provided appropriate sampling patterns exist) instead of using standard CS recovery algorithms. This flexibility suggests a reduction in computational overhead for systems estimating both sparse and nonsparse power spectra because one algorithm can be used to compute both compressive and noncompressive estimates."

    "title": "Switch Point biased Self-Training: Re-purposing Pretrained Models for Code-Switching",
    "summary": "Code-switching (CS), a ubiquitous phenomenon due to the ease of communication it offers in multilingual communities still remains an understudied problem in language processing. The primary reasons behind this are: (1) minimal efforts in leveraging large pretrained multilingual models, and (2) the lack of annotated data. The distinguishing case of low performance of multilingual models in CS is the intra-sentence mixing of languages leading to switch points. We first benchmark two sequence labeling tasks -- POS and NER on 4 different language pairs with a suite of pretrained models to identify the problems and select the best performing model, char-BERT, among them (addressing (1)). We then propose a self training method to repurpose the existing pretrained models using a switch-point bias by leveraging unannotated data (addressing (2)). We finally demonstrate that our approach performs well on both tasks by reducing the gap between the switch point performance while retaining the overall performance on two distinct language pairs in both the tasks. Our code is available here: https://github.com/PC09/EMNLP2021-Switch-Point-biased-Self-Training."

Generalization of RL agents is critical to success in the real world, yet zero-shot policy transfer is a challenging problem since even minor visual changes could make the trained agent completely fail in the new task. We propose USRA: Unified State Representation Learning under Data Augmentation, a representation learning framework that learns a latent unified state representation by performing data augmentations on its observations to improve its ability to generalize to unseen target domains. We showcase the success of our approach on the DeepMind Control Generalization Benchmark for the Walker environment and find that USRA achieves higher sample efficiency and 14.3% better domain adaptation performance compared to the best baseline results."

    "title": "Transform Learning for Magnetic Resonance Image Reconstruction: From Model-based Learning to Building Neural Networks",
    "summary": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used in clinical practice, but it has been traditionally limited by its slow data acquisition. Recent advances in compressed sensing (CS) techniques for MRI reduce acquisition time while maintaining high image quality. Whereas classical CS assumes the images are sparse in known analytical dictionaries or transform domains, methods using learned image models for reconstruction have become popular. The model could be pre-learned from datasets, or learned simultaneously with the reconstruction, i.e., blind CS (BCS). Besides the well-known synthesis dictionary model, recent advances in transform learning (TL) provide an efficient alternative framework for sparse modeling in MRI. TL-based methods enjoy numerous advantages including exact sparse coding, transform update, and clustering solutions, cheap computation, and convergence guarantees, and provide high-quality results in MRI compared to popular competing methods. This paper provides a review of some recent works in MRI reconstruction from limited data, with focus on the recent TL-based methods. A unified framework for incorporating various TL-based models is presented. We discuss the connections between transform learning and convolutional or filter bank models and corresponding multi-layer extensions, with connections to deep learning. Finally, we discuss recent trends in MRI, open problems, and future directions for the field."

    "summary": "Multi-task learning is an open and challenging problem in computer vision. The typical way of conducting multi-task learning with deep neural networks is either through handcrafted schemes that share all initial layers and branch out at an adhoc point, or through separate task-specific networks with an additional feature sharing/fusion mechanism. Unlike existing methods, we propose an adaptive sharing approach, called AdaShare, that decides what to share across which tasks to achieve the best recognition accuracy, while taking resource efficiency into account. Specifically, our main idea is to learn the sharing pattern through a task-specific policy that selectively chooses which layers to execute for a given task in the multi-task network. We efficiently optimize the task-specific policy jointly with the network weights, using standard back-propagation. Experiments on several challenging and diverse benchmark datasets with a variable number of tasks well demonstrate the efficacy of our approach over state-of-the-art methods.

Guided by symmetry considerations, we first relate the controversial CS terms to specific components in the spin conductance matrix. Then we quantify these components by studying the spin-dependent electron scattering on a fully compensated interface. We ascertain the absence of all CS contributions in the collinear regime. Even in the non-collinear regime, the CS contributions only constitute a higher-order correction to the existing theory."

    "summary": "We address the issue of applying quantized compressed sensing (CS) on low-energy telemonitoring. So far, few works studied this problem in applications where signals were only approximately sparse. We propose a two-stage data compressor based on quantized CS, where signals are compressed by compressed sensing and then the compressed measurements are quantized with only 2 bits per measurement. This compressor can greatly reduce the transmission bit-budget. To recover signals from underdetermined, quantized measurements, we develop a Bayesian De-quantization algorithm. It can exploit both the model of quantization errors and the correlated structure of physiological signals to improve the quality of recovery. The proposed data compressor and the recovery algorithm are validated on a dataset recorded on 12 subjects during fast running. Experiment results showed that an averaged 2.596 beat per minute (BPM) estimation error was achieved by jointly using compressed sensing with 50% compression ratio and a 2-bit quantizer. The results imply that we can effectively transmit n bits instead of n samples, which is a substantial improvement for low-energy wireless telemonitoring."

    "title": "Sequential Interval Passing for Compressed Sensing",
    "summary": "The reconstruction of sparse signals from a limited set of measurements poses a significant challenge as it necessitates a solution to an underdetermined system of linear equations. Compressed sensing (CS) deals with sparse signal reconstruction using techniques such as linear programming (LP) and iterative message passing schemes. The interval passing algorithm (IPA) is an attractive CS approach due to its low complexity when compared to LP. In this paper, we propose a sequential IPA that is inspired by sequential belief propagation decoding of low-density-parity-check (LDPC) codes used for forward error correction in channel coding. In the sequential setting, each check node (CN) in the Tanner graph of an LDPC measurement matrix is scheduled one at a time in every iteration, as opposed to the standard ``flooding'' interval passing approach in which all CNs are scheduled at once per iteration. The sequential scheme offers a significantly lower message passing complexity compared to flooding IPA on average, and for some measurement matrix and signal sparsity, a complexity reduction of 36% is achieved. We show both analytically and numerically that the reconstruction accuracy of the IPA is not compromised by adopting our sequential scheduling approach."

    "summary": "In a typical MIMO radar scenario, transmit nodes transmit orthogonal waveforms, while each receive node performs matched filtering with the known set of transmit waveforms, and forwards the results to the fusion center. Based on the data it receives from multiple antennas, the fusion center formulates a matrix, which, in conjunction with standard array processing schemes, such as MUSIC, leads to target detection and parameter estimation. In MIMO radars with compressive sensing (MIMO-CS), the data matrix is formulated by each receive node forwarding a small number of compressively obtained samples. In this paper, it is shown that under certain conditions, in both sampling cases, the data matrix at the fusion center is low-rank, and thus can be recovered based on knowledge of a small subset of its entries via matrix completion (MC) techniques. Leveraging the low-rank property of that matrix, we propose a new MIMO radar approach, termed, MIMO-MC radar, in which each receive node either performs matched filtering with a small number of randomly selected dictionary waveforms or obtains sub-Nyquist samples of the received signal at random sampling instants, and forwards the results to a fusion center. Based on the received samples, and with knowledge of the sampling scheme, the fusion center partially fills the data matrix and subsequently applies MC techniques to estimate the full matrix. MIMO-MC radars share the advantages of the recently proposed MIMO-CS radars, i.e., high resolution with reduced amounts of data, but unlike MIMO-CS radars do not require grid discretization. The MIMO-MC radar concept is illustrated through a linear uniform array configuration, and its target estimation performance is demonstrated via simulations."

We select the samples of CS from the ( , ) colour-magnitude diagrams, as, in this combination of filters, CS are bright and easy to identify. We fit the CS -band luminosity functions using a Lorentzian distribution modified to allow the distribution to be asymmetric. We use the parameters of the best-fit distribution to determine if the CS luminosity function of a given galaxy resembles that of the LMC or SMC. Based on this resemblance, we use either the LMC or SMC as the calibrator and estimate the distance to the given galaxy using the median magnitude ( ) of the CS samples. We apply this new method to the two Local Group galaxies NGC 6822 and IC 1613. We find that NGC 6822 has an \"LMC-like\" CS luminosity function while IC 1613 is more \"SMC-like\". Using the values for the median absolute magnitude for the LMC and SMC found in Paper I we find a distance modulus of (stat) for NGC 6822 and (stat) for IC 1613."

    "title": "Sample Size Calculations for the Development of Risk Prediction Models that Account for Performance Variability",
    "summary": "Existing approaches to sample size calculations for developing clinical prediction models have focused on ensuring that the expected value of a chosen performance measure meets a pre-specified target. For example, to limit model-overfitting, the sample size is commonly chosen such that the expected calibration slope (CS) is 0.9, close to 1 for a perfectly calibrated model. In practice, due to sampling variability, model performance can vary considerably across different development samples of the recommended size. If this variability is high, the probability of obtaining a model with performance close to the target for a given measure may be unacceptably low. To address this, we propose an adapted approach to sample size calculations that explicitly incorporates performance variability by targeting the probability of acceptable performance (PrAP). For example, in the context of calibration, we may define a model as acceptably calibrated if CS falls in a pre-defined range, e.g. between 0.85 and 1.15. Then we choose the required sample size to ensure that PrAP(CS)=80%. For binary outcomes we implemented our approach for CS within a simulation-based framework via the R package `samplesizedev'. Additionally, for CS specifically, we have proposed an equivalent analytical calculation which is computationally efficient. While we focused on CS, the simulation-based framework is flexible and can be easily extended to accommodate other performance measures and types of outcomes. When adhering to existing recommendations, we found that performance variability increased substantially as the number of predictors, p, decreased. Consequently, PrAP(CS) was often low. For example, with 5 predictors, PrAP(CS) was around 50%. Our adapted approach resulted in considerably larger sample sizes, especially for p<10. Applying shrinkage tends to improve PrAP(CS)."

    "title": "A fundamental mechanism of solar eruption initiation in multipolar magnetic field",
    "summary": "Recently we established a fundamental mechanism of solar eruption initiation, in which an eruption can be initiated from a bipolar field through magnetic reconnection in the current sheet (CS) that is formed slowly in the core field as driven by photospheric shearing motion. Here using a series of fully 3D MHD simulations with a range of different photospheric magnetic flux distributions, we extended this fundamental mechanism to the quadrupolar magnetic field containing a null point above the core field, which is the basic configuration of the classical breakout model. As is commonly believed, in such multipolar configuration, the reconnection triggered in the CS originated at the null point (namely, the breakout reconnection) plays the key role in eruption initiation by establishing a positive feedback-loop between the breakout reconnection and the expansion of the core field. However, our simulation showed that the key of eruption initiation in such multipolar configuration remains to be the slow formation of the CS in the sheared core rather than the onset of fast breakout reconnection. The breakout reconnection only helps the formation of the core CS by letting the core field expand faster, but the eruption cannot occur when the bottom surface driving is stopped well before the core CS is formed, even though the fast reconnection has already been triggered in the breakout CS. This study clarified the role of breakout reconnection and confirmed formation of the core CS as the key to the eruption initiation in a multipolar magnetic field."

We measure the coldest spot, found by applying the Spherical Mexican Hat Wavelet transform on 100 000 cut-sky (masked) and full-sky CMB simulated maps. The CS itself is barely affected by the mask; we estimate a 94 per cent probability that the CS is the full-sky temperature minimum. However, approximately 48 per cent (masked fraction of the mask) of full-sky minima are obscured by the mask. Since the observed minima are slightly hotter than the full-sky ensemble of minima, a cut-sky analysis would have found the CS to be significant at approximately 2.2 sigma with a wavelet angular scale of R = 5 degrees. None the less, comparisons to full-sky minima show the CS significance to be only approximately 1.9 sigma and less than 2 sigma for all R. The CS on the last scattering surface may be hotter due to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect in the line of sight. However, our simulations show that this on average only approximately 10 per cent (about 10 micro K but consistent with zero) of the CS temperature profile. This is consistent with Lambda and cold dark matter reconstructions of this effect based on observed line-of-sight voids."

    "summary": "Compressed Sensing (CS) is a novel technique for simultaneous signal sampling and compression based on the existence of a sparse representation of signal and a projected dictionary , where is the projection matrix and is the dictionary. To exactly recover the signal with a small number of measurements , the projected dictionary is expected to be of low mutual coherence. Several previous methods attempt to find the projection such that the mutual coherence of can be as low as possible. However, they do not minimize the mutual coherence directly and thus their methods are far from optimal. Also the solvers they used lack of the convergence guarantee and thus there has no guarantee on the quality of their obtained solutions. This work aims to address these issues. We propose to find an optimal projection by minimizing the mutual coherence of directly. This leads to a nonconvex nonsmooth minimization problem. We then approximate it by smoothing and solve it by alternate minimization. We further prove the convergence of our algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which directly minimizes the mutual coherence of the projected dictionary with a convergence guarantee. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can recover sparse signals better than existing methods."

    "summary": "We study the time-dependent formation and evolution of a current sheet (CS) in a magnetized, collisionless, high-beta plasma using hybrid-kinetic particle-in-cell simulations. An initially tearing-stable Harris sheet is frozen into a persistently driven incompressible flow so that its characteristic thickness gradually decreases in time. As the CS thins, the strength of the reconnecting field increases, and adiabatic invariance in the inflowing fluid elements produces a field-biased pressure anisotropy with excess perpendicular pressure. At large plasma beta, this anisotropy excites the mirror instability, which deforms the reconnecting field on ion-Larmor scales and dramatically reduces the effective thickness of the CS. Tearing modes whose wavelengths are comparable to that of the mirrors then become unstable, triggering reconnection on smaller scales and at earlier times than would have occurred if the thinning CS were to have retained its Harris profile. A novel method for identifying and tracking X-points is introduced, yielding X-point separations that are initially intermediate between the perpendicular and parallel mirror wavelengths in the upstream plasma. These mirror-stimulated tearing modes ultimately grow and merge to produce island widths comparable to the CS thickness, an outcome we verify across a range of CS formation timescales and initial CS widths. Our results may find their most immediate application in the tearing disruption of magnetic folds generated by turbulent dynamo in weakly collisional, high-beta, astrophysical plasmas."

It has also been shown that such stable embeddings can be achieved for general Riemannian submanifolds when random orthoprojectors are used for dimensionality reduction. Due to computational costs and system constraints, the CS community has recently explored the RIP for structured random matrices (e.g., random convolutions, localized measurements, deterministic constructions). The main contribution of this paper is to show that any matrix satisfying the RIP (i.e., providing a stable embedding for sparse signals) can be used to construct a stable embedding for manifold-modeled signals by randomizing the column signs and paying reasonable additional factors in the number of measurements. We demonstrate this result with several new constructions for stable manifold embeddings using structured matrices. This result allows advances in efficient projection schemes for sparse signals to be immediately applied to manifold signal models."

    "summary": "Compressive Sensing (CS) is a new paradigm for the efficient acquisition of signals that have sparse representation in a certain domain. Traditionally, CS has provided numerous methods for signal recovery over an orthonormal basis. However, modern applications have sparked the emergence of related methods for signals not sparse in an orthonormal basis but in some arbitrary, perhaps highly overcomplete, dictionary, particularly due to their potential to generate different kinds of sparse representation of signals. To this end, we apply a signal space greedy method, which relies on the ability to optimally project a signal onto a small number of dictionary atoms, to address signal recovery in this setting. We describe a generalized variant of the iterative recovery algorithm called Signal space Subspace Pursuit (SSSP) for this more challenging setting. Here, using the Dictionary-Restricted Isometry Property (D-RIP) rather than classical RIP, we derive a low bound on the number of measurements required and then provide the proof of convergence for the algorithm. The algorithm in noisy and noise-free measurements has low computational complexity and provides high recovery accuracy. Simulation results show that the algorithm outperforms best compared with the existing recovery algorithms."

It has been speculated that either new physics or ISW effect induced by the presence of a cosmic void at high redshift can account for the observations. Here we investigate if the systematic decrease in CMB temperature in the neighbourhood of nearby galaxies may create such a strong temperature depression. In particular, we note that the Eridanus supergroup and its neighbouring groups, is in the CS area. Our goal is to analyse observational galaxy data to characterise the neighbourhood of the CS, explore the properties of these galaxies and thereby make a prediction of the CMB temperature decrement in this region. We use the Planck SMICA maps and the galaxy catalogues 2MRS, 6dF and HIPASS as foreground tracers. We apply mean temperature profiles to model the temperature decrement from the galaxies in the CS area. Even after correcting for the mean low temperature of the CS region, we find that the temperature decrement around galaxies is significantly stronger than the mean decrement in other parts of the sky. We discuss whether this could be attributed to the fact that the CS area coincides with one of the regions populated by the most HI deficient galaxies. Modelling the foreground temperature profile, we find a particularly strong temperature decrement due to the presence of the late-type overabundant largest group complex in the nearby universe. A CS shape, which to a large degree overlaps with the CMB CS, is observed. We conclude that the coincidence of the only nearby spiral rich group complex located in the CS region, and the success of the modelling performed, adds strong evidence to the existence of a local extragalactic foreground which could account for the observed temperature depression, alleviating the tension with an otherwise Gaussian field expected in the CMB."

We show that this intriguing photo-stimulated process originates from the adsorption of Cs atoms via the neutralisation of Cs ions by substrate electrons. The Cs ions are produced via two-photon absorption by excited Cs atoms very close to the surface, which enables the transfer of the laser spatial intensity profile to the film thickness. An initial decrease of the surface work function is required to guarantee Cs neutralisation and results in a threshold in the vapour density. This understanding of the film growth mechanism may facilitate the development of new techniques of laser-controlled lithography, starting from thermal vapours."

Strong theoretical guarantees have been established concerning the embedding of a sparse signal family under a random measurement operator and on the accuracy to which sparse signals can be recovered from noisy compressive measurements. In this paper, we address similar questions in the context of a different modeling framework. Instead of sparse models, we focus on the broad class of manifold models, which can arise in both parametric and non-parametric signal families. Using tools from the theory of empirical processes, we improve upon previous results concerning the embedding of low-dimensional manifolds under random measurement operators. We also establish both deterministic and probabilistic instance-optimal bounds in for manifold-based signal recovery and parameter estimation from noisy compressive measurements. In line with analogous results for sparsity-based CS, we conclude that much stronger bounds are possible in the probabilistic setting. Our work supports the growing evidence that manifold-based models can be used with high accuracy in compressive signal processing."

First, we develop bounds on the trade-off between security and bandwidth overhead that any fingerprinting defense scheme can achieve. This enables us to compare schemes with different security/overhead trade-offs by comparing how close they are to the lower bound. We then refine, implement, and evaluate the Congestion Sensitive BuFLO scheme outlined by Cai, et al. CS-BuFLO, which is based on the provably-secure BuFLO defense proposed by Dyer, et al., was not fully-specified by Cai, et al, but has nonetheless attracted the attention of the Tor developers.

Based on a high-resolution 2.5-dimensional MHD simulation of magnetic reconnection, we explore the formation mechanism of the CS oscillations. We find that large-amplitude transverse waves are excited by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) at the highly turbulent cusp-shaped region. The perturbations propagate upward along the CS with a phase speed close to local Alfvén speed thus resulting in the CS oscillations we observe. Though the perturbations damp after propagating for a long distance, the CS oscillations are still detectable.

Each transmitter is assumed to be a fully rational entity with complete information on the game, aiming to maximize its own individual spectral efficiency by tuning its own power allocation (PA) vector. Two scenarios are analysed. First, we consider that transmitters can split their transmit power between both dimensions (PA game). Second, we consider that each transmitter is limited to use only one dimension (channel selection CS game). In the first scenario, the game might have either one or three NE in pure strategies (PS). However, two or infinitely many NE in PS might also be observed with zero probability. In the second scenario, there always exists either one or two NE in PS. We show that in both games there always exists a non-zero probability of observing more than one NE. More interestingly, using Monte-Carlo simulations, we show that the highest and lowest network spectral efficiency at any of the NE in the CS game are always higher than the ones in the PA."

This ranking relies on a careful analysis of the research groups in terms of their size, number of PhDs graduated, research results and their impact, among other variables. While research results are not the only variable to consider, they are frequently given special attention because of the notoriety they confer to the researchers and the programs they are affiliated with. In here we introduce a new metric for quantifying publication output, called R-Score for reputation-based score, which can be used in support to the ranking of research groups or programs. The novelty is that the metric depends solely on the listings of the publications of the members of a group, with no dependency on citation counts. R-Score has some interesting properties: (a) it does not require access to the contents of published material, (b) it can be curated to produce highly accurate results, and (c) it can be naturally used to compare publication output of research groups (e.g., graduate programs) inside a same country, geographical area, or across the world. An experiment comparing the publication output of 25 CS graduate programs from Brazil suggests that R-Score can be quite useful for providing early insights into the publication patterns of the various research groups one wants to compare."

    "summary": "In favourable cases the low energy dynamics of a stack of M2-branes at a toric Calabi-Yau fourfold singularity can be described by an N=2 supersymmetric Chern-Simons quiver theory, but there still does not exists an \"inverse algorithm\" going from the toric data of the CY_4 to the CS quiver. We make progress in that direction by deriving CS quiver theories for M2-branes probing cones over a large class of geometries Ypq(B_4), which are S^3/Z_p bundles over toric Fano varieties B_4. We rely on the type IIA understanding of CS quivers, giving a firm string theory footing to our CS theories. In particular we give a derivation of some previously conjectured CS quivers in the case B_4= CP^1*CP^1, as field theories dual to M-theory backgrounds with nontrivial torsion G_4 fluxes."

    "summary": "We theoretically investigate the dynamics and stability of a temporal cavity soliton (CS) excited inside a silicon-based microresonator that exhibits free-carrier generation as a result of two-photon absorption (TPA). The optical propagation of the CS is modeled through a mean-field Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE) coupled with an ordinary differential equation accounting for the generation of free carriers owing to TPA. The CS experiences several perturbations (like intrapulse Raman scattering (IRS), TPA, free-carrier absorption (FCA), free-carrier dispersion (FCD), etc.) during its round-trip evolution inside the cavity. We develop a full variational analysis based on a Ritz optimization principle which is useful in deriving simple analytical expressions describing the dynamics of individual pulse parameters of the CS under perturbation. TPA and FCA limit the efficient comb generation and modify the stability condition of the CS. We determine the critical condition of stability modified due to TPA and derive closed-form expressions of the saturated amplitude and width of stable CS. We perform detailed modulation-instability analysis and obtain stability condition against perturbations of steady-state solution of LLE. The CS experiences FCD which leads to a temporal acceleration resulting in spectral blueshift. Exploiting the variational analysis, we estimate these temporal and spectral shifts. We also include IRS in our perturbation theory and analytically estimate the frequency redshifting. Finally, we study the effect of pump-phase-modulation on a stable CS. All our analytical results are found to be in good agreement with the data obtained from the full numerical solution of LLE."

    "summary": "Concept inventories are standardized assessments that evaluate student understanding of key concepts within academic disciplines. While prevalent across STEM fields, their development lags for advanced computer science topics like dynamic programming (DP) -- an algorithmic technique that poses significant conceptual challenges for undergraduates. To fill this gap, we developed and validated a Dynamic Programming Concept Inventory (DPCI). We detail the iterative process used to formulate multiple-choice questions targeting known student misconceptions about DP concepts identified through prior research studies. We discuss key decisions, tradeoffs, and challenges faced in crafting probing questions to subtly reveal these conceptual misunderstandings. We conducted a preliminary psychometric validation by administering the DPCI to 172 undergraduate CS students finding our questions to be of appropriate difficulty and effectively discriminating between differing levels of student understanding. Taken together, our validated DPCI will enable instructors to accurately assess student mastery of DP. Moreover, our approach for devising a concept inventory for an advanced theoretical computer science concept can guide future efforts to create assessments for other under-evaluated areas currently lacking coverage."

    "summary": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have aroused great attention in Compressed Sensing (CS) restoration. However, the working mechanism of DNNs is not explainable, thereby it is unclear that how to design an optimal DNNs for CS restoration. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical framework to explain DNNs, which proves that the hidden layers of DNNs are equivalent to Gibbs distributions and interprets DNNs as a Bayesian hierarchical model. The framework provides a Bayesian perspective to explain the working mechanism of DNNs, namely some hidden layers learn a prior distribution and other layers learn a likelihood distribution. Moreover, the framework provides insights into DNNs and reveals two inherent limitations of DNNs for CS restoration. In contrast to most previous works designing an end-to-end DNNs for CS restoration, we propose a novel DNNs to model a prior distribution only, which can circumvent the limitations of DNNs. Given the prior distribution generated from the DNNs, we design a Bayesian inference algorithm to realize CS restoration in the framework of Bayesian Compressed Sensing. Finally, extensive simulations validate the proposed theory of DNNs and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art CS restoration methods."

A promising alternative approach focuses on character-level translation, which simplifies processing pipelines in NMT considerably. This approach, however, must consider relatively longer sequences, rendering the training process prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we discuss a novel, Transformer-based approach, that we compare, both in speed and in quality to the Transformer at subword and character levels, as well as previously developed character-level models. We evaluate our models on 4 language pairs from WMT'15: DE-EN, CS-EN, FI-EN and RU-EN. The proposed novel architecture can be trained on a single GPU and is 34% percent faster than the character-level Transformer; still, the obtained results are at least on par with it. In addition, our proposed model outperforms the subword-level model in FI-EN and shows close results in CS-EN. To stimulate further research in this area and close the gap with subword-level NMT, we make all our code and models publicly available."

    "summary": "In this paper, an efficient distributed approach for implementing the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm, named distributed AMP (DAMP), is developed for compressed sensing (CS) recovery in sensor networks with the sparsity K unknown. In the proposed DAMP, distributed sensors do not have to use or know the entire global sensing matrix, and the burden of computation and storage for each sensor is reduced. To reduce communications among the sensors, a new data query algorithm, called global computation for AMP (GCAMP), is proposed. The proposed GCAMP based DAMP approach has exactly the same recovery solution as the centralized AMP algorithm, which is proved theoretically in the paper. The performance of the DAMP approach is evaluated in terms of the communication cost saved by using GCAMP. For comparison purpose, thresholding algorithm (TA), a well known distributed Top-K algorithm, is modified so that it also leads to the same recovery solution as the centralized AMP. Numerical results demonstrate that the GCAMP based DAMP outperforms the Modified TA based DAMP, and reduces the communication cost significantly."

    "summary": "Compressed Sensing (CS) based channel estimation techniques have recently emerged as an effective way to acquire the channel of millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems with a small number of measurements. These techniques, however, are based on prior knowledge of transmit and receive array manifolds, and assume perfect antenna arrays at both the transmitter and the receiver. In the presence of antenna imperfections, the geometry and response of the arrays are modified. This distorts the CS measurement matrix and results in channel estimation errors. This paper studies the effects of both transmit and receive antenna imperfections on the mmWave channel estimate. A relay-aided solution which corrects for errors caused by faulty transmit arrays is then proposed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution and show that comparable channel estimates can be obtained when compared to systems with perfect antennas without the need for additional training overhead."

    "title": "Custodial symmetry, Georgi-Machacek model, and other scalar extensions",
    "summary": "In an SU(2) gauge theory, if the gauge bosons turn out to be degenerate after spontaneous symmetry breaking, obviously these mass terms are invariant under a global SU(2) symmetry that is unbroken. The pure gauge terms are also invariant under this symmetry. This symmetry is called the custodial symmetry (CS). In gauge theories, CS implies a mass relation between the and the bosons. The Standard Model (SM), as well as various extensions of it in the scalar sector, possess such a symmetry. In this paper, we critically examine the notion of CS and show that there may be three different classes of CS, depending on the gauge couplings and self-couplings of the scalars. Among old models that preserve CS, we discuss the Two-Higgs Doublet Model and the one doublet plus two triplet model by Georgi and Machacek. We show that for two-triplet extensions, the Georgi-Machacek model is not the most general possibility with CS. Rather, we find, as the most general extension, a new model with more parameters and hence a richer phenomenology. Some of the consequences of this new model have also been discussed."

Previously these two tasks, reconstruction and classification were treated as separate problems. This is the first work to propose a combined framework to address the issue in a holistic fashion. Reconstruction techniques for biomedical signals for tele-monitoring are largely based on compressed sensing (CS) based method, these are designed techniques where the reconstruction formulation is based on some assumption regarding the signal. In this work, we propose a new paradigm for reconstruction we learn to reconstruct. An autoencoder can be trained for the same. But since the final goal is to analyze classify the signal we learn a linear classification map inside the autoencoder. The ensuing optimization problem is solved using the Split Bregman technique. Experiments have been carried out on reconstruction and classification of ECG arrhythmia classification and EEG seizure classification signals. Our proposed tool is capable of operating in a semi-supervised fashion. We show that our proposed method is better and more than an order magnitude faster in reconstruction than CS based methods; it is capable of real-time operation. Our method is also better than recently proposed classification methods. Significance: This is the first work offering an alternative to CS based reconstruction. It also shows that representation learning can yield better results than hand-crafted features for signal analysis."

This task is known as the problem of learning halfspaces in learning theory and one-bit compressive sensing (1bit-CS) in signal processing. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms based on both convex and nonconvex sparsity-inducing penalties for robust 1bit-CS. We provide a sufficient condition to verify whether a solution is globally optimal or not. Then we show that the globally optimal solution for positive homogeneous penalties can be obtained in two steps: a proximal operator and a normalization step. For several nonconvex penalties, including minimax concave penalty (MCP), norm, and sorted penalty, we provide fast algorithms for finding the analytical solutions by solving the dual problem. Specifically, our algorithm is more than times faster than the existing algorithm for MCP. Its efficiency is comparable to the algorithm for the penalty in time, while its performance is much better. Among these penalties, the sorted penalty is most robust to noise in different settings."

    "summary": "Explaining why an answer is in the result of a query or why it is missing from the result is important for many applications including auditing, debugging data and queries, and answering hypothetical questions about data. Both types of questions, i.e., why and why-not provenance, have been studied extensively. In this work, we present the first practical approach for answering such questions for queries with negation (first-order queries). Our approach is based on a rewriting of Datalog rules (called firing rules) that captures successful rule derivations within the context of a Datalog query. We extend this rewriting to support negation and to capture failed derivations that explain missing answers. Given a (why or why-not) provenance question, we compute an explanation, i.e., the part of the provenance that is relevant to answer the question. We introduce optimizations that prune parts of a provenance graph early on if we can determine that they will not be part of the explanation for a given question. We present an implementation that runs on top of a relational database using SQL to compute explanations. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach scales to large instances and significantly outperforms an earlier approach which instantiates the full provenance to compute explanations."

However, a pre-trained teacher model is not always accessible due to training cost, privacy, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel online knowledge distillation framework to resolve this problem. Specifically, each student GNN model learns the extracted local structure from another simultaneously trained counterpart in an alternating training procedure. We further develop a cross-layer distillation strategy by aligning ahead one student layer with the layer in different depth of another student model, which theoretically makes the structure information spread over all layers. Experimental results on five datasets including PPI, Coauthor-CS/Physics and Amazon-Computer/Photo demonstrate that the student performance is consistently boosted in our collaborative training framework without the supervision of a pre-trained teacher model. In addition, we also find that our alignahead technique can accelerate the model convergence speed and its effectiveness can be generally improved by increasing the student numbers in training.

    "summary": "Existing image compressed sensing (CS) coding frameworks usually solve an inverse problem based on measurement coding and optimization-based image reconstruction, which still exist the following two challenges: 1) The widely used random sampling matrix, such as the Gaussian Random Matrix (GRM), usually leads to low measurement coding efficiency. 2) The optimization-based reconstruction methods generally maintain a much higher computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a new CNN based image CS coding framework using local structural sampling (dubbed CSCNet) that includes three functional modules: local structural sampling, measurement coding and Laplacian pyramid reconstruction. In the proposed framework, instead of GRM, a new local structural sampling matrix is first developed, which is able to enhance the correlation between the measurements through a local perceptual sampling strategy. Besides, the designed local structural sampling matrix can be jointly optimized with the other functional modules during training process. After sampling, the measurements with high correlations are produced, which are then coded into final bitstreams by the third-party image codec. At last, a Laplacian pyramid reconstruction network is proposed to efficiently recover the target image from the measurement domain to the image domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing state-of-the-art CS coding methods, while maintaining fast computational speed."

CS has not yet gained widespread adoption in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), despite potentially offering the advantages of lower acquisition time and enhanced tolerance to noise. Here we applied a simple CS framework, using a weighted iterative thresholding algorithm for CS reconstruction, to representative high-resolution STM images of superconducting surfaces and adsorbed molecules. We calculated reconstruction diagrams for a range of scanning patterns, sampling densities, and noise intensities, evaluating reconstruction quality for the whole image and chosen defects. Overall we find that typical STM images can be satisfactorily reconstructed down to 30\\% sampling - already a strong improvement. We furthermore outline limitations of this method, such as sampling pattern artifacts, which become particularly pronounced for images with intrinsic long-range disorder, and propose ways to mitigate some of them. Finally we investigate compressibility of STM images as a measure of intrinsic noise in the image and a precursor to CS reconstruction, enabling a priori estimation of the effectiveness of CS reconstruction with minimal computational cost."

This paper presents a publicly available database of 64 scanned images of transverse sections of commercially grown Pinus taeda trees from northern Uruguay, ranging from 17 to 24 years old. The collection contains several challenging features for automatic ring detection, including illumination and surface preparation variation, fungal infection (blue stains), knot formation, missing cortex or interruptions in outer rings, and radial cracking. This dataset can be used to develop and test automatic tree ring detection algorithms. This paper presents to the dendrochronology community one such method, Cross-Section Tree-Ring Detection (CS-TRD), which identifies and marks complete annual rings in cross-sections for tree species presenting a clear definition between early and latewood. We compare the CS-TRD performance against the ground truth manual delineation of all rings over the UruDendro dataset. The CS-TRD software identified rings with an average F-score of 89% and RMSE error of 5.27px for the entire database in less than 20 seconds per image. Finally, we propose a robust measure of the ring growth using the equivalent radius of a circle having the same area enclosed by the detected tree ring. Overall, this study contributes to the dendrochronologist's toolbox of fast and low-cost methods to automatically detect rings in conifer species, particularly for measuring diameter growth rates and stem transverse area using entire cross-sections."

Large spatial-scale problems falling within this category - i.e. wide-scale transdisciplinary modelling for environment (WSTMe) - often deal with factors (a) for which deep-uncertainty may prevent usual statistical analysis of modelled quantities and need different ways for providing policy-making with science-based support.

This is accomplished by checking if two CSs -- one forwards and the other backwards -- ever fail to intersect. Since the literature on CSs has been rapidly evolving recently, the reduction provided in this paper immediately solves several old and new change detection problems. Further, our \"backward CS\", constructed by reversing time, is new and potentially of independent interest.

    "summary": "Constructing nonasymptotic confidence intervals (CIs) for the mean of a univariate distribution from independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) observations is a fundamental task in statistics. For bounded observations, a classical nonparametric approach proceeds by inverting standard concentration bounds, such as Hoeffding's or Bernstein's inequalities. Recently, an alternative betting-based approach for defining CIs and their time-uniform variants called confidence sequences (CSs), has been shown to be empirically superior to the classical methods. In this paper, we provide theoretical justification for this improved empirical performance of betting CIs and CSs. Our main contributions are as follows: (i) We first compare CIs using the values of their first-order asymptotic widths (scaled by ), and show that the betting CI of Waudby-Smith and Ramdas (2023) has a smaller limiting width than existing empirical Bernstein (EB)-CIs. (ii) Next, we establish two lower bounds that characterize the minimum width achievable by any method for constructing CIs/CSs in terms of certain inverse information projections. (iii) Finally, we show that the betting CI and CS match the fundamental limits, modulo an additive logarithmic term and a multiplicative constant. Overall these results imply that the betting CI~(and CS) admit stronger theoretical guarantees than the existing state-of-the-art EB-CI~(and CS); both in the asymptotic and finite-sample regimes."

To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy, Divide and Conquer Reasoning (DCR), to enhance the reasoning capability of LLMs for MCQs, as inspired by human beings using heuristics to first categorize tasks and then handle them separately. In particular, we first categorize questions into two subsets based on confidence score ( ), which is estimated by statistical frequency of generated answers. Subsequently, we propose Filter Choices based Reasoning (FCR) to improve model performance on MCQs with low ( ).

We work out the string tension of the confining potential which acts between the spinons and show that the CS term induces a screening effect on the magnetic field only. The confining potential between spinons is not affected by the CS flux. The strict site-occupation by a single spin 1/2 is enforced by the introduction of an imaginary chemical potential constraint."

Eigenstates of generators of the group are constructed as one dimensional integral superpositions of CS along their orbits. We distinguish certain privileged orbits where the superposition is in phase. Interestingly, for closed in phase orbits, the geometric phase must be quantized to , else the superposition vanishes. This corresponds to exact Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization. The maximum of the Husimi-Kano quasiprobability distribution is used to diagnose where in phase space the eigenstates of the generators lie. The function of a generator eigenstate is constant along each orbit. We conjecture that the maximum of the function corresponds to these privileged in phase orbits. We provide some intuition for this proposition using interference in phase space, and then demonstrate it for canonical CS ( oscillator group), spin CS ( ) and CS, relevant to squeezing."

This paper proposes using these statistics for analyzing random compressed sensing matrices, in the non-asymptotic regime (relevant to practice). The aim is to address certain pessimisms of \"worst-case\" restricted isometry analyses, as observed by both Blanchard & Dossal, et. al. We show how U-statistics can obtain \"average-case\" analyses, by relating to statistical restricted isometry property (StRIP) type recovery guarantees. However unlike standard StRIP, random signal models are not required; the analysis here holds in the almost sure (probabilistic) sense. For Gaussian/bounded entry matrices, we show that both l1-minimization and LASSO essentially require on the order of k [ ((n-k)/u) + 2(k/n) (n/k) ] measurements to respectively recover at least 1-5u fraction, and 1-4u fraction, of the signals.

Empirical evidence suggests our analysis to compare well to Donoho & Tanner's recent large deviation bounds for l0/l1-equivalence, in the regime of block lengths 1000-3000 with high undersampling (50-150 measurements); similar system sizes are found in recent CS implementation. In this work, it is assumed throughout that matrix columns are independently sampled."

    "title": "Estimating Unknown Sparsity in Compressed Sensing",
    "summary": "In the theory of compressed sensing (CS), the sparsity ||x||_0 of the unknown signal x ^p is commonly assumed to be a known parameter. However, it is typically unknown in practice. Due to the fact that many aspects of CS depend on knowing ||x||_0, it is important to estimate this parameter in a data-driven way. A second practical concern is that ||x||_0 is a highly unstable function of x. In particular, for real signals with entries not exactly equal to 0, the value ||x||_0=p is not a useful description of the effective number of coordinates. In this paper, we propose to estimate a stable measure of sparsity s(x):=||x||_1^2/||x||_2^2, which is a sharp lower bound on ||x||_0. Our estimation procedure uses only a small number of linear measurements, does not rely on any sparsity assumptions, and requires very little computation. A confidence interval for s(x) is provided, and its width is shown to have no dependence on the signal dimension p. Moreover, this result extends naturally to the matrix recovery setting, where a soft version of matrix rank can be estimated with analogous guarantees. Finally, we show that the use of randomized measurements is essential to estimating s(x). This is accomplished by proving that the minimax risk for estimating s(x) with deterministic measurements is large when n<<p."

    "summary": "Bit vectors are fundamental building blocks of many succinct data structures. They can be used to represent graphs, are an important part of many text indices in the form of the wavelet tree, and can be used to encode ordered sequences of integers as Elias-Fano codes. To do so, two queries have to be answered: namely rank and select queries. Given a position in the bit vector, a rank query returns the number of 1-bits before that position. A select query, given a parameter , returns the position of the -th 1-bit. On a length-n bit vector, both queries can be answered in time and require bits of additional space. In practice, the smallest (uncompressed) rank and select data structure cs-poppy has a space overhead of 3.51% [Zhou et al., SEA 13]. In this paper, we present an improved rank and select data structure that has the same space overhead but can answer queries up to 8% (rank) and 16.5% (select) faster compared with cs-poppy."

Although iterative rounding methods have been applied to packing problems, no single method has emerged that matches the effectiveness and simplicity afforded by the covering case. We offer a simple iterative packing technique that retains features of Jain's seminal approach, including the property that the magnitude of the fractional value of the element rounded during each iteration has a direct impact on the approximation guarantee. We apply iterative packing to generalized matching problems including demand matching and -column-sparse column-restricted packing ( -CS-PIP) and obtain approximation algorithms that essentially settle the integrality gap for these problems. We present a simple deterministic -approximation for -CS-PIP, where an -approximation was the best deterministic algorithm previously known. The integrality gap in this case is at least . We also give a deterministic -approximation for a generalization of demand matching, settling its natural integrality gap."

Graph generation is a crucial computational task on graphs with numerous real-world applications. It aims to learn the distribution of given graphs and then generate new graphs. Given the great success of diffusion models in image generation, increasing efforts have been made to leverage these techniques to advance graph generation in recent years. In this paper, we first provide a comprehensive overview of generative diffusion models on graphs, In particular, we review representative algorithms for three variants of graph diffusion models, i.e., Score Matching with Langevin Dynamics (SMLD), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), and Score-based Generative Model (SGM). Then, we summarize the major applications of generative diffusion models on graphs with a specific focus on molecule and protein modeling.

    "summary": "Many gauge theories possess a hidden duality between color and kinematics in their on-shell scattering amplitudes. An open problem is to formulate an off-shell realization of the duality, thus manifesting a kinematic algebra. We show that 3D Chern-Simons (CS) theory in Lorenz gauge obeys off-shell color-kinematics duality. This holds both for the gauge field and the BRST ghosts, and the duality is manifest in the Feynman rules. A kinematic algebra can be formulated through a second-order differential operator (Poisson bracket) acting on the off-shell fields, and it corresponds to 3D volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, generated by functions in Lorenz gauge. We consider several admissible double-copy constructions of CS theory with Yang-Mills theory, a higher-derivative (DF)^2 gauge theory, or CS theory itself. To obtain non-vanishing amplitudes, we deform pure CS theory by including the maximum amount of adjoint matter that respects the on-shell duality. This gives a new formulation of an N=4 CS-matter theory, with fields of unusual statistics. We argue that the color-stripped tree amplitudes of this theory are equivalent to those of the Gaiotto-Witten N=4 CS theory with bi-fundamental matter. We further show that the double copy of the N=4 CS theory with itself corresponds to maximally supersymmetric N=8 Dirac-Born-Infeld theory."

Special attention is paid to Lagrangians invariant only up to a surface term, shown to be in a one-to-one correspondence with Chern-Simons (CS) theories for unbroken symmetry. Without making specific assumptions on spacetime symmetry, we give explicit expressions for these Lagrangians, generalizing the Berry and Hopf terms in ferromagnets. Globally well-defined matrix expressions are derived for symmetric coset spaces of broken symmetry. The CS Lagrangians exhibit special properties, on both the perturbative and the global topological level. The order-one CS term is responsible for non-invariance of canonical momentum density under internal symmetry, known as the linear momentum problem. The order-three CS term gives rise to a novel type of interaction among NG bosons. All the CS terms are robust against local variations of microscopic physics."

    "title": "Convex Shape Prior for Deep Neural Convolution Network based Eye Fundus Images Segmentation",
    "summary": "Convex Shapes (CS) are common priors for optic disc and cup segmentation in eye fundus images. It is important to design proper techniques to represent convex shapes. So far, it is still a problem to guarantee that the output objects from a Deep Neural Convolution Networks (DCNN) are convex shapes. In this work, we propose a technique which can be easily integrated into the commonly used DCNNs for image segmentation and guarantee that outputs are convex shapes. This method is flexible and it can handle multiple objects and allow some of the objects to be convex. Our method is based on the dual representation of the sigmoid activation function in DCNNs. In the dual space, the convex shape prior can be guaranteed by a simple quadratic constraint on a binary representation of the shapes. Moreover, our method can also integrate spatial regularization and some other shape prior using a soft thresholding dynamics (STD) method. The regularization can make the boundary curves of the segmentation objects to be simultaneously smooth and convex. We design a very stable active set projection algorithm to numerically solve our model. This algorithm can form a new plug-and-play DCNN layer called CS-STD whose outputs must be a nearly binary segmentation of convex objects. In the CS-STD block, the convexity information can be propagated to guide the DCNN in both forward and backward propagation during training and prediction process. As an application example, we apply the convexity prior layer to the retinal fundus images segmentation by taking the popular DeepLabV3+ as a backbone network. Experimental results on several public datasets show that our method is efficient and outperforms the classical DCNN segmentation methods."

The time-frequency resource allocated for initial access, however, is limited, which gives rise to need for efficient approaches for beam detection. For hybrid analog-digital beamforming (HB) architectures, which are used to reduce power consumption, we propose a compressed sensing (CS) based approach for 5G initial access beam detection that is for a HB architecture and that is compliant with the 3GPP standard. The CS-based approach is compared with the exhaustive search in terms of beam detection accuracy and by simulation is shown to outperform. Up to 256 antennas are considered, and the importance of a careful codebook design is reaffirmed."

With the combined choice of characters from multiple languages, the outcome from character-based models suffers from phoneme duplication, resulting in language-inconsistent spellings. We propose Contextualized Connectionist Temporal Classification (CCTC) loss to encourage spelling consistencies of a character-based non-autoregressive ASR which allows for faster inference. The CCTC loss conditions the main prediction on the predicted contexts to ensure language consistency in the spellings. In contrast to existing CTC-based approaches, CCTC loss does not require frame-level alignments, since the context ground truth is obtained from the model's estimated path. Compared to the same model trained with regular CTC loss, our method consistently improved the ASR performance on both CS and monolingual corpora."

    "summary": "Many communication systems involve high bandwidth, while sparse, radio frequency (RF) signals. Working with high frequency signals requires appropriate system-level components such as high-speed analog-to-digital converters (ADC). In particular, an analog signal should be sampled at rates that meet the Nyquist requirements to avoid aliasing. However, implementing high-speed ADC devices can be a limiting factor as well as expensive. To mitigate the caveats with high-speed ADC, the solution space can be explored in several dimensions such as utilizing the compressive sensing (CS) framework in order to reduce the sampling rate to the order of information rate of the signal rather than a rate dictated by the Nyquist. In this note, we review the compressive sensing structure and its extensions for continuous-time signals, which is ultimately used to reduce the sampling rate of high-speed ADC devices. Moreover, we consider the application of the compressive sensing framework in wireless sensor networks to save power by reducing the transmission rate of sensor nodes. We propose an alternative solution for the CS minimization problem that can be solved using gradient descent methods. The modified minimization problem is potentially faster and simpler to implement at the hardware level."

We use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate two candidate systems of brain regions which may support this -- the Multiple Demand (MD) system, known to respond to a range of cognitively demanding tasks, and the Language system (LS), known to primarily respond to language stimuli. We devise experiment conditions to isolate the act of code comprehension, and employ a state-of-the-art method to locate brain systems of interest. We administer these experiments in Python (24 participants) and Scratch Jr. (19 participants) - which provides a visual interface to programming, thus eliminating the effect of text in code comprehension. From this robust experiment setup, we find that the Language system is not consistently involved in code comprehension, while the MD is. Further, we find no other brain regions beyond those in the MD to be responsive to code. We also find that variable names, the control flow used in the program, and the types of operations performed do not affect brain responses. We discuss the implications of our findings on the software engineering and CS education communities."

    "title": "Deep Learning based Channel Estimation for Massive MIMO with Hybrid Transceivers",
    "summary": "Accurate and efficient estimation of the high dimensional channels is one of the critical challenges for practical applications of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). In the context of hybrid analog-digital (HAD) transceivers, channel estimation becomes even more complicated due to information loss caused by limited radio-frequency chains. The conventional compressive sensing (CS) algorithms usually suffer from unsatisfactory performance and high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning (DL) based framework for uplink channel estimation in HAD massive MIMO systems. To better exploit the sparsity structure of channels in the angular domain, a novel angular space segmentation method is proposed, where the entire angular space is segmented into many small regions and a dedicated neural network is trained offline for each region. During online testing, the most suitable network is selected based on the information from the global positioning system. Inside each neural network, the region-specific measurement matrix and channel estimator are jointly optimized, which not only improves the signal measurement efficiency, but also enhances the channel estimation capability. Simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CS algorithms in terms of estimation performance and computational complexity."

In this work, to tackle explainability and generalizability, we propose a unifying deep unfolding multi-sampling-ratio interpretable CS-MRI framework. The combined approach offers more generalizability than previous works whereas deep learning gains explainability through a geometric prior module. Inspired by the multigrid algorithm, we first embed the CS-MRI-based optimization algorithm into correction-distillation scheme that consists of three ingredients: pre-relaxation module, correction module and geometric prior distillation module. Furthermore, we employ a condition module to learn adaptively step-length and noise level, which enables the proposed framework to jointly train multi-ratio tasks through a single model. The proposed model not only compensates for the lost contextual information of reconstructed image which is refined from low frequency error in geometric characteristic k-space , but also integrates the theoretical guarantee of model-based methods and the superior reconstruction performances of deep learning-based methods. Therefore, it can give us a novel perspective to design biomedical imaging networks. Numerical experiments show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our method achieves 3.18 dB improvement at low CS ratio 10\\% and average 1.42 dB improvement over other comparison methods on brain dataset using Cartesian sampling mask."

If properly chosen, the number of measurements can be significantly smaller than the ambient dimension of the signal and yet preserve the significant signal information. Interestingly, it can be shown that random measurement schemes provide a near-optimal encoding in terms of the required number of measurements. In this report, we explore another relatively unexplored, though often alluded to, advantage of using random matrices to acquire CS measurements. Specifically, we show that random matrices are democractic, meaning that each measurement carries roughly the same amount of signal information. We demonstrate that by slightly increasing the number of measurements, the system is robust to the loss of a small number of arbitrary measurements. In addition, we draw connections to oversampling and demonstrate stability from the loss of significantly more measurements."

Because of the growing scale of these conferences, the tight timelines on which they operate, and a recent surge in explicitly dishonest behavior, there is now no alternative to performing this matching in an automated way. This paper studies a novel reviewer-paper matching approach that was recently deployed in the 35th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2021), and has since been adopted (wholly or partially) by other conferences including ICML 2022, AAAI 2022, and IJCAI 2022. This approach has three main elements: (1) collecting and processing input data to identify problematic matches and generate reviewer-paper scores; (2) formulating and solving an optimization problem to find good reviewer-paper matchings; and (3) a two-phase reviewing process that shifts reviewing resources away from papers likely to be rejected and towards papers closer to the decision boundary.

In standard parallel execution, per-iteration waiting time is limited by the execution time of the straggling servers. Coded DGD techniques have been introduced recently, which can tolerate straggling servers via assigning redundant computation tasks to the CSs. In most of the existing DGD schemes, either with coded computation or coded communication, the non-straggling CSs transmit one message per iteration once they complete all their assigned computation tasks. However, although the straggling servers cannot complete all their assigned tasks, they are often able to complete a certain portion of them. In this paper, we allow multiple transmissions from each CS at each iteration in order to make sure a maximum number of completed computations can be reported to the aggregating server (AS), including the straggling servers. We numerically show that the average completion time per iteration can be reduced significantly by slightly increasing the communication load per server."

    "summary": "Vision-Language Models (vLLMs) have emerged as powerful architectures for joint reasoning over visual and textual inputs, enabling breakthroughs in image captioning, cross modal retrieval, and multimodal dialogue. However, as these models scale to longer video sequences and richer language descriptions, the quadratic complexity of the standard attention mechanism presents a fundamental computational bottleneck. This challenge is exacerbated in vLLMs, where attention must be computed not only within modalities but also across them, leading to prohibitive memory and latency costs. In this work, we introduce the Compressed Sensing Attention Transformer (CSAT), a novel architecture that reimagines attention computation through the lens of compressed sensing. By projecting high dimensional key and value representations into a lower-dimensional subspace via random measurement matrices and reconstructing the attention outputs using sparse recovery algorithms, CSAT significantly reduces attention complexity while maintaining semantic fidelity. Applied to vLLMs, CSAT exploits the inherent compressibility of both visual and textual representations especially evident in video, where temporal redundancy is high, and in language, where cross-modal grounding is often sparse. In contrast to LLMs, which must often model entangled symbolic dependencies, vLLMs benefit from structured sparsity in alignment and scene composition, making them particularly well-suited to compressed attention. We provide a formal mathematical treatment of CSAT, demonstrate its integration into vision language pipelines, and validate its performance on standard benchmarks, highlighting its promise as a scalable, interpretable, and resource efficient solution for next generation multimodal transformers."

The sensitivity of mainstream OAD models to varying video viewpoints often hampers their generalization when confronted with unseen sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA) model, which leverages probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed representations of video frames in a cross-view setting. The PTMA model incorporates a GRU-based temporal masked attention (TMA) cell, which leverages these representations to effectively query the input video sequence, thereby enhancing information interaction and facilitating autoregressive frame-level video analysis. Additionally, multi-view information can be integrated into the probabilistic modeling to facilitate the extraction of view-invariant features. Experiments conducted under three evaluation protocols: cross-subject (cs), cross-view (cv), and cross-subject-view (csv) show that PTMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DAHLIA, IKEA ASM, and Breakfast datasets."

    "summary": "In millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems, beamforming with large antenna arrays is critical to overcome high path losses. Separating all-digital beamforming into analog and digital stages can provide the large reduction in power consumption and small loss in spectral efficiency needed for practical implementations. Developing algorithms with this favorable tradeoff is challenging due to the additional degrees of freedom in the analog stage and its accompanying hardware constraints. In hybrid beamforming systems, for example, channel estimation algorithms do not directly observe the channels, face a high channel count, and operate at low SNR before transmit-receive beam alignment. Since mmWave channels are sparse in time and beam domains, many compressed sensing (CS) channel estimation algorithms have been developed that randomly configure the analog beamformers, digital beamformers, and/or pilot symbols. In this paper, we propose to design deterministic beamformers and pilot symbols for open-loop channel estimation. We use CS approaches that rely on low coherence for their recovery guarantees, and hence seek to minimize the mutual coherence of the compressed sensing matrix. We also propose a precoder column ordering to design the pilot symbols. Simulation results show that our beamformer designs reduce channel estimation error over competing methods."

(2016) reported a near-infrared (NIR) excess for SN 2012dn, and proposed that the excess originates from an echo by circumstellar (CS) dust. In this paper, we examine a detailed distribution of the CS dust around SN 2012dn, and investigate implications of the CS dust echo scenario for general cases of SC-SNe Ia. We find that a disk/bipolar CS medium configuration reproduces the NIR excess fairly well, where the radial density distribution is given by a stationary mass loss. The inner radius of the CS dust is pc. The mass-loss rate of the progenitor system is estimated to be and M yr for the disk and bipolar CS medium configurations, respectively, which adds another support for the single degenerate scenario. Our models limit SN 2009dc, another SC-SN Ia, to have a dust mass less than times that of SN 2012dn. While this may merely indicate some variation on the CS environment among SC-SNe Ia, this could raise another interesting possibility. There could be two classes among SC-SNe Ia; the brighter SC-SNe Ia in a clean environment (SN 2009dc) and the fainter SC-SNe Ia in a dusty environment (SN 2012dn)."

In particular, we derive the high-rate scaling law for MP decoding of LDPC codes on the binary erasure channel (BEC) and the -ary symmetric channel ( -SC). For the BEC, the density evolution (DE) threshold of iterative decoding scales like and the critical stopping ratio scales like . For the -SC, the DE threshold of verification decoding depends on the details of the decoder and scales like for one decoder. Using the fact that coding over large finite alphabets is very similar to coding over the real numbers, the analysis of verification decoding is also extended to the the compressed sensing (CS) of strictly-sparse signals. A DE based approach is used to analyze the CS systems with randomized-reconstruction guarantees. This leads to the result that strictly-sparse signals can be reconstructed efficiently with high-probability using a constant oversampling ratio (i.e., when the number of measurements scales linearly with the sparsity of the signal). A stopping-set based approach is also used to get stronger (e.g., uniform-in-probability) reconstruction guarantees."

Further, females, under-represented minorities, and first generation students may be too intimidated or the idea of research may be too amorphous, so that they miss out on these programs. As a consequence, we lose out on opportunities for greater diversity in CS research. We have started a pilot program in our department where a larger number of students (close to two dozen) work with a single faculty member as part of a research group focused on Machine Learning and related areas. The goal of this program is not to convince students to pursue a research career but rather to enable them to make a more informed decision about what role they would like research to play in their future. In order to evaluate our approach, we elicited student experience via two anonymized exit surveys. Students report that they develop a better understanding of what research in Computer Science is.

    "title": "Correlations between Chondroitin Sulfate Physicochemical Properties and its in-vitro Absorption and Anti-inflammatory Activity",
    "summary": "Here, we investigated the influence of physicochemical characteristics of chondroitin sulfate (CS) on its in vitro absorption and anti-inflammatory activity. We used eight different synthetic and natural CS samples with a range of molecular weights (7-35 kDa) and sulfation patterns. Our studies indicate that the absorption of CS is moderately correlated to percentage of chondroitin-6-sulfate while the anti-inflammatory activity may be weakly related to the molecular weight and the amount of total sulfation in the samples. Our in vitro studies could provide helpful screening tools for quick and effective evaluation of CS samples as a preliminary step towards in vivo studies."

    "title": "Simulation analysis of the Compton-to-peak method for quantifying radiocesium deposition quantities",
    "summary": "Compton-to-peak analysis is a method for selecting coefficients for converting count rates measured with in situ gamma ray spectrometry to radioactivity concentrations of Cs and Cs in the environment. Compton-to-peak analysis is based on the count rate ratio between the spectral regions containing scattered gamma rays to the primary Cs and Cs photopeaks (known as the Compton-to-peak ratio - RCP). RCP changes with the vertical distribution of Cs and Cs within the ground. Inferring this distribution enables the selection of appropriate count rate to activity concentration conversion coefficients. Here PHITS was used to simulate the dependency of RCP on different vertical distributions of Cs and Cs within the ground. A model was created of a LaBr (Ce) detector used in drone helicopter aerial surveys in Fukushima Prefecture. The model was verified by comparing simulated gamma ray spectra to measurements from test sources. Simulations were performed for the infinite half-space geometry to calculate the dependency of RCP on the mass depth distribution (exponential or uniform) of Cs and Cs within the ground, and on the altitude of the detector above the ground. The calculations suggest that the sensitivity of the Compton-to-peak method is greatest for the initial period following nuclear fallout when Cs and Cs are located close to the ground surface, and for aerial surveys conducted at low altitudes. This is because the relative differences calculated between RCP with respect to changes in the mass depth distribution were largest for these two cases. Data on the measurement height above and on the Cs to Cs activity ratio is necessary for applying the Compton-to-peak method to determine the distribution and radioactivity concentration of Cs and Cs within the ground."

    "summary": "Phase-only compressed sensing (PO-CS) concerns the recovery of sparse signals from the phases of complex measurements. Recent results show that sparse signals in the standard sphere can be exactly recovered from complex Gaussian phases by a linearization procedure, which recasts PO-CS as linear compressed sensing and then applies (quadratically constrained) basis pursuit to obtain . This paper focuses on the instance optimality and robustness of . First, we strengthen the nonuniform instance optimality of Jacques and Feuillen (2021) to a uniform one over the entire signal space. We show the existence of some universal constant such that holds for all in the unit Euclidean sphere, where is the distance of to its closest -sparse signal. This is achieved by showing the new sensing matrices corresponding to all approximately sparse signals simultaneously satisfy RIP. Second, we investigate the estimator's robustness to noise and corruption. We show that dense noise with entries bounded by some small , appearing either prior or posterior to retaining the phases, increments by . This is near-optimal (up to log factors) for any algorithm. On the other hand, adversarial corruption, which changes an arbitrary -fraction of the measurements to any phase-only values, increments by . The developments are then combined to yield a robust instance optimal guarantee that resembles the standard one in linear compressed sensing."

    "title": "On the Cyclostationary Linear Inverse Models: A Mathematical Insight and Implication",
    "summary": "Cyclostationary linear inverse models (CS-LIMs), generalized versions of the classical (stationary) LIM, are advanced data-driven techniques for extracting the first-order time-dependent dynamics and random forcing relevant information from complex non-linear stochastic processes. Though CS-LIMs lead to a breakthrough in climate sciences, their mathematical background and properties are worth further exploration. This study focuses on the mathematical perspective of CS-LIMs and introduces two variants: e-CS-LIM and l-CS-LIM. The former refines the original CS-LIM using the interval-wise linear Markov approximation, while the latter serves as an analytic inverse model for the linear periodic stochastic systems. Although relying on approximation, e-CS-LIM converges to l-CS-LIM under specific conditions and shows noise-robust performance. Numerical experiments demonstrate that each CS-LIM reveals the temporal structure of the system. The e-CS-LIM optimizes the original model for better dynamics performance, while l-CS-LIM excels in diffusion estimation due to reduced approximation reliance. Moreover, CS-LIMs are applied to real-world ENSO data, yielding a consistent result aligning with observations and current ENSO understanding."

With the rise of large language models (LLMs), there is potential to leverage this technology to support NNES students more effectively. Recent implementations of LLMs as tutors in classrooms have shown promising results. In this study, we deployed an LLM tutor in an accelerated introductory computing course to evaluate its effectiveness specifically for NNES students. Key insights for LLM tutor use are as follows: NNES students signed up for the LLM tutor at a similar rate to native English speakers (NES); NNES students used the system at a lower rate than NES students -- to a small effect; NNES students asked significantly more questions in languages other than English compared to NES students, with many of the questions being multilingual by incorporating English programming keywords. Results for views of the LLM tutor are as follows: both NNES and NES students appreciated the LLM tutor for its accessibility, conversational style, and the guardrails put in place to guide users to answers rather than directly providing solutions; NNES students highlighted its approachability as they did not need to communicate in perfect English; NNES students rated help-seeking preferences of online resources higher than NES students; Many NNES students were unfamiliar with computing terminology in their native languages. These results suggest that LLM tutors can be a valuable resource for NNES students in computing, providing tailored support that enhances their learning experience and overcomes language barriers."

    "title": "Diffusion Adaptation Framework for Compressive Sensing Reconstruction",
    "summary": "Compressive sensing(CS) has drawn much attention in recent years due to its low sampling rate as well as high recovery accuracy. As an important procedure, reconstructing a sparse signal from few measurement data has been intensively studied. Many reconstruction algorithms have been proposed and shown good reconstruction performance. However, when dealing with large-scale sparse signal reconstruction problem, the storage requirement will be high, and many algorithms also suffer from high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion adaptation framework for CS reconstruction, where the reconstruction is performed in a distributed network. The data of measurement matrix are partitioned into small parts and are stored in each node, which assigns the storage load in a decentralized manner. The local information interaction provides the reconstruction ability. Then, a simple and efficient gradient-descend based diffusion algorithm has been proposed to collaboratively recover the sparse signal over network. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. To further increase the convergence speed, a mini-batch based diffusion algorithm is also proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can achieve good reconstruction accuracy as well as fast convergence speed."

    "summary": "This paper proposes a low-computational Bayesian algorithm for noisy sparse recovery (NSR), called BHT-BP. In this framework, we consider an LDPC-like measurement matrices which has a tree-structured property, and additive white Gaussian noise. BHT-BP has a joint detection-and-estimation structure consisting of a sparse support detector and a nonzero estimator. The support detector is designed under the criterion of the minimum detection error probability using a nonparametric belief propagation (nBP) and composite binary hypothesis tests. The nonzeros are estimated in the sense of linear MMSE, where the support detection result is utilized. BHT-BP has its strength in noise robust support detection, effectively removing quantization errors caused by the uniform sampling-based nBP. Therefore, in the NSR problems, BHT-BP has advantages over CS-BP which is an existing nBP algorithm, being comparable to other recent CS solvers, in several aspects. In addition, we examine impact of the minimum nonzero value of sparse signals via BHT-BP, on the basis of the results of the recent literature. Our empirical result shows that variation of x_min is reflected to recovery performance in the form of SNR shift."

The use of tools such as ChatGPT to complete various student programming exercises (e.g., in Python) and assignments has gained prominence amongst various academic institutions. However, recent literature has suggested that the use of ChatGPT in academia is problematic and the impact on teaching and learning should be further scrutinized. More specifically, little is known about how ChatGPT can be practically used with code (programming) writing to complete programming exercises amongst IS and CS undergraduate university students. Furthermore, the paper provides insights for academics who teach programming to create more challenging exercises and how to engage responsibly in the use of ChatGPT to promote classroom integrity. In this paper, we used Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) theory as a theoretical guide to understand the various dynamics through classroom code demonstrations. Using ChatGPT 3.5, we analyzed the various practical programming examples from past IS exercises and compared those with memos created by tutors and lecturers in a university setting. This paper highlights common ways of assessment, programming errors created by ChatGPT and the potential consideration for IS academics to ensure the development of critical programming skills among students."

    "summary": "A method we developed recently for the reconstruction of the initial density field in the nearby Universe is applied to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. A high-resolution N-body constrained simulation (CS) of the reconstructed initial condition, with particles evolved in a 500 Mpc/h box, is carried out and analyzed in terms of the statistical properties of the final density field and its relation with the distribution of SDSS galaxies. We find that the statistical properties of the cosmic web and the halo populations are accurately reproduced in the CS. The galaxy density field is strongly correlated with the CS density field, with a bias that depend on both galaxy luminosity and color. Our further investigations show that the CS provides robust quantities describing the environments within which the observed galaxies and galaxy systems reside. Cosmic variance is greatly reduced in the CS so that the statistical uncertainties can be controlled effectively even for samples of small volumes."

    "summary": "Massive connectivity for extra large-scale multi-input multi-output (XL-MIMO) systems is a challenging issue due to the near-field access channels and the prohibitive cost. In this paper, we propose an uplink grant-free massive access scheme for XL-MIMO systems, in which a mixed-analog-to-digital converters (ADC) architecture is adopted to strike the right balance between access performance and power consumption. By exploiting the spatial-domain structured sparsity and the piecewise angular-domain cluster sparsity of massive access channels, a compressive sensing (CS)-based two-stage orthogonal approximate message passing algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the joint activity detection and channel estimation problem. Particularly, high-precision quantized measurements are leveraged to perform accurate hyper-parameter estimation, thereby facilitating the activity detection. Moreover, we adopt a subarray-wise estimation strategy to overcome the severe angular-domain energy dispersion problem which is caused by the near-field effect in XL-MIMO channels. Simulation results verify the superiority of our proposed algorithm over state-of-the-art CS algorithms for massive access based on XL-MIMO with mixed-ADC architectures."

    "summary": "Turbulence plays a key role for forming the complex geometry of the large-scale current sheet (CS) and fast energy release in a solar eruption. In this paper, we present full 3D high-resolution simulations for the process of a moderate Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) and the thermodynamical evolution of the highly confined CS. Copious elongated blobs are generated due to tearing and plasmoid instabilities giving rise to a higher reconnection rate and undergo the splitting, merging and kinking processes in a more complex way in 3D. A detailed thermodynamical analysis shows that the CS is mainly heated by adiabatic and numerical viscous terms, and thermal conduction is the dominant factor that balances the energy inside the CS. Accordingly, the temperature of the CS reaches to a maximum of about 20 MK and the range of temperatures is relatively narrow. From the face-on view in the synthetic Atmospheric Imaging Assembly 131 , the downflowing structures with similar morphology to supra-arcade downflows are mainly located between the post-flare loops and loop-top, while moving blobs can extend spikes higher above the loop-top. The downward-moving plasmoids can keep the twisted magnetic field configuration until the annihilation at the flare loop-top, indicating that plasmoid reconnection dominates in the lower CS. Meanwhile, the upward-moving ones turn into turbulent structures before arriving at the bottom of the CME, implying that turbulent reconnection dominates in the upper CS. The spatial distributions of the turbulent energy and anisotropy are addressed, which show a significant variation in the spectra with height."

Similarly the diffusion constant, , at a constant temperature has a maximum at a density and a minimum at a density , and structural properties are also anomalous. For the discrete CS potential none of these anomalies are observed. The absence of anomalies in the discrete case and its presence in the continuous CS potential are discussed in the framework of the excess entropy."

It is assumed that the signal model p(x) is known, and w CN(w;0,S_w), for known S_W. The objective is to design a projection matrix M C^(l x m) to maximize key information-theoretic quantities with operational significance, including the mutual information between the signal and the projections I(x;y) or the Renyi entropy of the projections h_a(y) (Shannon entropy is a special case). By capitalizing on explicit characterizations of the gradients of the information measures with respect to the projections matrix, where we also partially extend the well-known results of Palomar and Verdu from the mutual information to the Renyi entropy domain, we unveil the key operations carried out by the optimal projections designs: mode exposure and mode alignment. Experiments are considered for the case of compressive sensing (CS) applied to imagery. In this context, we provide a demonstration of the performance improvement possible through the application of the novel projection designs in relation to conventional ones, as well as justification for a fast online projections design method with which state-of-the-art adaptive CS signal recovery is achieved."

    "summary": "The compressive sensing (CS) and 1-bit CS demonstrate superior efficiency in signal acquisition and resource conservation, while 1-bit CS achieves maximum resource efficiency through sign-only measurements. With the emergence of massive data, the distributed signal aggregation under CS and 1-bit CS measurements introduces many challenges, including nonconvexity and heterogeneity. The nonconvexity originates from the unidentifiability of signal magnitude under finite-precision measurements. The heterogeneity arises from the signal and noisy measurement on each node. To address these challenges, we propose a framework with a squared cosine similarity penalty. We address nonconvexity by an novel invex relaxation formulation to ensure the uniqueness of the global optimality. For heterogeneous signals and noisy measurements, the proposed estimate adaptively debiases through correction guided by similarity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) information. Our method achieves a high probability minimax-optimal convergence rate under sufficient node counts and similarity conditions, improving from to , with signal dimension , local and total sizes and . Extensive simulations validate the method's effectiveness and performance gains in reconstructing heterogeneous signals from 1-bit CS measurements.

In the envisioned system, IoT devices are connected with the centralized cloud server (CS) via multiple fog access points (F-APs). We consider two different scenarios for training the local models. In the first scenario, local models are trained at the IoT devices and the F-APs upload the local model parameters to the CS. In the second scenario, local models are trained at the F-APs based on the collected data from the IoT devices and the F-APs collaborate with the CS for updating the model parameters. Our objective is to minimize the overall energy-consumption of both scenarios subject to FL time constraint. Towards this goal, we devise a joint optimization of scheduling of IoT devices with the F-APs, transmit power allocation, computation frequency allocation at the devices and F-APs and decouple it into two subproblems. In the first subproblem, we optimize the IoT device scheduling and power allocation, while in the second subproblem, we optimize the computation frequency allocation. For each scenario, we develop a conflict graph based solution to iteratively solve the two subproblems. Simulation results show that the proposed two schemes achieve a considerable performance gain in terms of the energy consumption minimization. The presented simulation results interestingly reveal that for a large number of IoT devices and large data sizes, it is more energy efficient to train the local models at the IoT devices instead of the F-APs."

SCNet combines both the explicit guidance from optimization algorithms with implicit regularization from advanced NN blocks to learn a collaborative signal representation.

UAVs communicate with each other during flight and exchange information with each other. However, such communication poses security challenges due to its dynamic topology. To solve these challenges, the proposed method uses two phases to counter malicious UAV attacks. In the first phase, we applied a number of rules and principles to detect malicious UAVs. In this phase, we try to identify and remove malicious UAVs according to the behavior of UAVs in the network in order to prevent sending fake information to the investigating UAVs. In the second phase, a mobile agent based on a three-step negotiation process is used to eliminate malicious UAVs. In this way, we use mobile agents to inform our normal neighbor UAVs so that they do not listen to the data generated by the malicious UAVs. Therefore, the mobile agent of each UAV uses reliable neighbors through a three-step negotiation process so that they do not listen to the traffic generated by the malicious UAVs. The NS-3 simulator was used to demonstrate the efficiency of the SAUAV method. The proposed method is more efficient than CST-UAS, CS-AVN, HVCR, and BSUM-based methods in detection rate, false positive rate, false negative rate, packet delivery rate, and residual energy."

Its main focus is finding bugs and generating test cases with the aim of maximizing code coverage. A previous approach to concolic testing in logic programming was not sound because it only dealt with positive constraints (by means of substitutions) but could not represent negative constraints. In this paper, we present a novel framework for concolic testing of CLP programs that generalizes the previous technique. In the CLP setting, one can represent both positive and negative constraints in a natural way, thus giving rise to a sound and (potentially) more efficient technique. Defining verification and testing techniques for CLP programs is increasingly relevant since this framework is becoming popular as an intermediate representation to analyze programs written in other programming paradigms."

We present an extension of the low-rank representation (LRR) model, termed the clustering-aware structure-constrained low-rank representation (CS-LRR) model, for unsupervised learning of human action attributes from video data. Our model is based on the union-of-subspaces (UoS) framework, and integrates spectral clustering into the LRR optimization problem for better subspace clustering results. We lay out an efficient linear alternating direction method to solve the CS-LRR optimization problem. We also introduce a hierarchical subspace clustering approach, termed hierarchical CS-LRR, to learn the attributes without the need for a priori specification of their number. By visualizing and labeling these action attributes, the hierarchical model can be used to semantically summarize long video sequences of human actions at multiple resolutions. A human action or activity can also be uniquely represented as a sequence of transitions from one action attribute to another, which can then be used for human action recognition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model for semantic summarization and action recognition through comprehensive experiments on five real-world human action datasets."

These biases limit the availability of high-quality data, leaving size estimates reliant on spherical shape assumptions. Such approximations introduce significant uncertainties propagating, e.g. into density determinations or thermophysical and compositional studies, affecting our understanding of asteroid properties. Aims. This work targets poorly studied main-belt asteroids, most of which lacked shape models. Using only high-quality dense light curves, thermal IR observations (incl. WISE), and stellar occultations, we aimed to produce reliable shape models and scale them via two independent techniques, allowing size comparison. We conducted two campaigns to obtain dense photometric light curves and to acquire multi-chord stellar occultations. Methods. Shape and spin models were reconstructed using lightcurve inversion. Sizes were determined by (1) thermophysical modeling with the Convex Inversion Thermophysical Model (CITPM), optimizing spin and shape models to visible lightcurve and IR data, and (2) scaling shape models with stellar occultations. Results. We obtained precise sizes and shape models for 15 asteroids. CITPM- and occultation-derived sizes agree within 5% in most cases, demonstrating the modeling's reliability. Larger discrepancies usually stem from incomplete occultation chord coverage. The study also gives insights into surface properties incl. albedo, roughness and thermal inertia. Conclusions. Using high-quality data and an advanced TPM integrating thermal and visible data with shape adjustment enabled precise size estimates comparable to those from multi-chord stellar occultations. We resolved major inconsistencies in previous size estimates, providing solid input for future studies on asteroid densities and surfaces."

Approach: We evaluated DIR accuracy in 25 patients treated with 30 Gy in 5 fractions on a 1.5 T MR-linac using an adaptive workflow. A reference MR was used for planning, with three images collected at each fraction: adapt MR for adaptive planning, verify MR for pretreatment position verification and beam-on for capturing anatomy during radiation delivery. We assessed three DIR approaches: intensity-based, intensity-based with controlling structures (CS) and novel intensity based with controlling structures and points of interest (CS+P). DIRs were performed between the reference and fraction images and within fractions. We propagated CTV, bladder, and rectum contours using the DIRs and compared to manual contours using Dice similarity coefficient, mean distance to agreement (DTAmean), and dose-volume metrics. Results: CS and CS+P improved geometric agreement between contours over intensity-only DIR. DTAmean for reference-to-beam-on intensity-only DIR was 0.131+/-0.009cm (CTV), 0.46+/-0.08cm (bladder), and 0.154+/-0.013cm (rectum). For the CS, the values were 0.018+/-0.002cm, 0.388+/-0.14cm, and 0.036+/-0.013cm. For CS+P these values were 0.015+/-0.001cm, 0.025+/-0.004cm, and 0.021+/-0.002cm. Dosimetrically, comparing CS and CS+P for reference to beam-on DIRs resulted in a change of CTV D98% from [-29cGy, 19cGy] to [-18cGy, 26cGy], rectum D1cc from [-106cGy, 72cGy] to [-52cGy, 74cGy], and bladder D5cc from [-51cGy, 544cGy] to [-79cGy, 36cGy].

The DC-LCS problem provides a clear mathematical formulation of a sequence comparison problem in Computational Biology and generalizes two other constrained variants of the LCS problem: the Constrained LCS and the Repetition-Free LCS. We present two results for the DC-LCS problem. First, we illustrate a fixed-parameter algorithm where the parameter is the length of the solution. Secondly, we prove a parameterized hardness result for the Constrained LCS problem when the parameter is the number of the constraint strings and the size of the alphabet A. This hardness result also implies the parameterized hardness of the DC-LCS problem (with the same parameters) and its NP-hardness when the size of the alphabet is constant."

Results: Re-Con-GAN consistently achieved comparable/better PSNR, SSIM, and RMSE scores compared to CS/UNet models. The inference time of Re-Con-GAN, UNet and CS are 0.15s, 0.16s, and 120s. The GTV detection task showed that Re-Con-GAN and CS, compared to UNet, better improved the dice score (3x Re-Con-GAN 80.98%; 3x CS 80.74%; 3x UNet 79.88%) of unprocessed under-sampled images (3x 69.61%). Conclusion: A generative network with adversarial training is proposed with promising and efficient reconstruction results demonstrated on an in-house dataset. The rapid and qualitative reconstruction of 4D liver MR has the potential to facilitate online adaptive MR-guided radiotherapy for liver cancer."

    "summary": "Single walled carbon nanotubes of 2 nm diameter and 3 to 13 micro meter length were compressed in Cu bullets and irradiated with positive ions of Cs with energies from 0.2 to 2.0 keV and subjected to successively increasing Cs dose. From the mass spectra of the sputtered carbon atoms and clusters as a function of Cs energy the monitoring of trend of the relative number densities of the fragmenting species indicates the accumulating damage. Irradiation induced fragmentation provide clues to the structural changes as a result of creation of vacancies due to the sputtering of monatomic, diatomic, triatomic and higher species. Monitoring of the the irradiated target electrical conductivity provides information of the sequences of the transformation that may be occurring in the structures of the single walled carbon nanotube as a function of Cs energy and dose."

    "title": "Dynamic Routing for the Electric Vehicle Shortest Path Problem with Charging Station Occupancy Information",
    "summary": "We study EVs traveling from origin to destination in the shortest time, focusing on long-distance settings with energy requirements exceeding EV autonomy. The EV may charge its battery at public Charging Stations (CSs), which are subject to uncertain waiting times. We model CSs using appropriately defined queues, whose status is revealed upon the EV arrival. However, we consider the availability of real-time binary Occupancy Indicator (OI) information, signaling if a CS is busy or not. At each OI update, we determine the sequence of CSs to visit along with associated charging quantities. We name the resulting problem the Electric Vehicle Shortest Path Problem with charging station Occupancy Indicator information (EVSPP-OI). In this problem, we consider that the EV is allowed to partially charge its battery, and we model charging times via piecewise linear charging functions that depend on the CS technology. We propose an MDP formulation for the EVSPP-OI and develop a reoptimization algorithm that establishes the sequence of CS visits and charging amounts based on system updates. Specifically, we propose a simulation-based approach to estimate the waiting time of the EV at a CS as a function of its arrival time. As the path to a CS may consist of multiple intermediate CS stops, estimating the arrival times at each CS is fairly intricate. To this end, we propose an efficient heuristic that yields approximate lower bounds on the arrival time of the EV at each CS. We use these estimations to define a deterministic EVSPP, which we solve with an existing algorithm. We conduct a comprehensive computational study and compare the performance of our methodology with a benchmark that observes the status of CSs only upon arrival. Results show that our method reduces waiting times and total trip duration by an average of 23.7%-95.4% and 1.4%-18.5%, respectively."

Arguments are spelled out as to why fractional statistics is only possible in two space dimensions. This phenomenon is most naturally discussed within the framework of field theories with CS term, hence as a prelude to this discussion I first discuss the various properties of the CS term. In particular its role as a gauge field mass term is emphasized. In the presence of the CS term, anyons can appear in two different ways i.e. either as soliton of the corresponding field theory or as a fundamental quanta carrying fractional statistics and both approaches are elaborated in some detail."

    "summary": "Self-supervised representation learning of Multivariate Time Series (MTS) is a challenging task and attracts increasing research interests in recent years. Many previous works focus on the pretext task of self-supervised learning and usually neglect the complex problem of MTS encoding, leading to unpromising results. In this paper, we tackle this challenge from two aspects: encoder and pretext task, and propose a unified channel-aware self-supervised learning framework CaSS. Specifically, we first design a new Transformer-based encoder Channel-aware Transformer (CaT) to capture the complex relationships between different time channels of MTS. Second, we combine two novel pretext tasks Next Trend Prediction (NTP) and Contextual Similarity (CS) for the self-supervised representation learning with our proposed encoder. Extensive experiments are conducted on several commonly used benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art comparing with previous self-supervised MTS representation learning methods (up to +7.70\\% improvement on LSST dataset) and can be well applied to the downstream MTS classification."

    "summary": "PIBT is a popular Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) method at the core of many state-of-the-art MAPF methods including LaCAM, CS-PIBT, and WPPL. The main utility of PIBT is that it is a very fast and effective single-step MAPF solver and can return a collision-free single-step solution for hundreds of agents in less than a millisecond. However, the main drawback of PIBT is that it is extremely greedy in respect to its priorities and thus leads to poor solution quality. Additionally, PIBT cannot use all the planning time that might be available to it and returns the first solution it finds. We thus develop Anytime PIBT, which quickly finds a one-step solution identically to PIBT but then continuously improves the solution in an anytime manner. We prove that Anytime PIBT converges to the optimal solution given sufficient time. We experimentally validate that Anytime PIBT can rapidly improve single-step solution quality within milliseconds and even find the optimal single-step action. However, we interestingly find that improving the single-step solution quality does not have a significant effect on full-horizon solution costs."

    "summary": "Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is crucial for ensuring safe and efficient autonomous driving. This work explores the integration of Transformer based model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based technique to enhance spatial and temporal feature learning in vehicle trajectory prediction. Here, a hybrid model that combines LSTMs for temporal encoding with a Transformer encoder for capturing complex interactions between vehicles is proposed. Spatial trajectory features of the neighboring vehicles are processed and goes through a masked scatter mechanism in a grid based environment, which is then combined with temporal trajectory of the vehicles. This combined trajectory data are learned by sequential LSTM encoding and Transformer based attention layers. The proposed model is benchmarked against predecessor LSTM based methods, including STA-LSTM, SA-LSTM, CS-LSTM, and NaiveLSTM. Our results, while not outperforming it's predecessor, demonstrate the potential of integrating Transformers with LSTM based technique to build interpretable trajectory prediction model. Future work will explore alternative architectures using Transformer applications to further enhance performance. This study provides a promising direction for improving trajectory prediction models by leveraging transformer based architectures, paving the way for more robust and interpretable vehicle trajectory prediction system."

With the advent of a number of multimodal models, there is the potential to reduce the amount of manual labor for this task. In this work, we aim to explore different models and determine what is most effective for the Hateful Memes Challenge, a challenge by Meta designed to further machine learning research in content moderation. Specifically, we explore the differences between early fusion and late fusion models in classifying multimodal memes containing text and images. We first implement a baseline using unimodal models for text and images separately using BERT and ResNet-152, respectively. The outputs from these unimodal models were then concatenated together to create a late fusion model. In terms of early fusion models, we implement ConcatBERT, VisualBERT, ViLT, CLIP, and BridgeTower. It was found that late fusion performed significantly worse than early fusion models, with the best performing model being CLIP which achieved an AUROC of 70.06.

    "title": "HACK: Hallucinations Along Certainty and Knowledge Axes",
    "summary": "Hallucinations in LLMs present a critical barrier to their reliable usage. Existing research usually categorizes hallucination by their external properties rather than by the LLMs' underlying internal properties. This external focus overlooks that hallucinations may require tailored mitigation strategies based on their underlying mechanism. We propose a framework for categorizing hallucinations along two axes: knowledge and certainty. Since parametric knowledge and certainty may vary across models, our categorization method involves a model-specific dataset construction process that differentiates between those types of hallucinations. Along the knowledge axis, we distinguish between hallucinations caused by a lack of knowledge and those occurring despite the model having the knowledge of the correct response. To validate our framework along the knowledge axis, we apply steering mitigation, which relies on the existence of parametric knowledge to manipulate model activations. This addresses the lack of existing methods to validate knowledge categorization by showing a significant difference between the two hallucination types. We further analyze the distinct knowledge and hallucination patterns between models, showing that different hallucinations do occur despite shared parametric knowledge. Turning to the certainty axis, we identify a particularly concerning subset of hallucinations where models hallucinate with certainty despite having the correct knowledge internally. We introduce a new evaluation metric to measure the effectiveness of mitigation methods on this subset, revealing that while some methods perform well on average, they fail disproportionately on these critical cases. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both knowledge and certainty in hallucination analysis and call for targeted mitigation approaches that consider the hallucination underlying factors."

    "title": "Sparse Sampling for Fast Quasiparticle Interference Mapping",
    "summary": "Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is a notoriously slow technique; Data-recording is serial which renders complex measurement tasks, such as quasiparticle interference (QPI) mapping, impractical. However, QPI would provide insight into band-structure details of quantum materials which can be inaccessible to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Here we use compressed sensing (CS) to fundamentally speed-up QPI mapping. We reliably recover the QPI information from a fraction of the usual local density of state measurements. The requirement of CS is naturally fulfilled for QPI, since CS relies on sparsity in a vector domain, here given by few nonzero coefficients in Fourier space. We exemplify CS on a simulated Cu(111) surface using random sampling of constant and varying probability density. We further simplify the motion of the STM tip through an open traveling salesman's problem for greater efficiency. We expect that the implications of our CS approach will be transformative for the exploration of 2D quantum materials."

These artifacts become more prominent when use in the presence of undersampled data. Recently, compressed sensing (CS) is developed as an MR reconstruction technique, to recover good quality images from the compressive k-space samples. To maximize the benefits of CS in free breathing data, it is understandable to use CS with the motion corrected images. In this paper, we have developed a new CS based motion corrected image reconstruction technique. In this two-stage technique, we use similarity measure to sort the motion corrupted data into different respiratory states. Then, we use a new reconstruction algorithm, which iteratively performs reconstruction and motion correction. The performance of the proposed method is qualitatively and quantitively evaluated using simulated data and clinical data. Results depict that this method performs the better reconstruction of respiratory motion corrected cardiac cine images as compared to the CS based reconstruction method."

The edges of the Pb nano-islands are decorated with Cs adatoms, and the nano-islands preferentially nucleate and grow on the quantum mechanically unstable regions of the mesa. Furthermore, first-principles calculations within density functional theory show that the Pb atoms forming these nano-islands were expelled by the adsorbed Cs atoms via a kinetically accessible place exchange process when the Cs atoms alloyed into the top layer of the Pb mesa."

Several sulfur-bearing molecules are observed in the interstellar medium and in comets, in strong contrast to protoplanetary disks where only CS, H CS and SO have been detected so far. Aims. We combine observations and chemical models to constrain the sulfur abundances and their sensitivity to physical and chemical conditions in the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. Methods. We obtained ALMA observations of DM Tau in Bands 4 and 6 in lines of CS, SO, SO , OCS, CCS, H CS and H S, achieving a mJy sensitivity. Using the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX and the forward-modeling tool DiskFit, disk-averaged CS column densities and upper limits for the other species were derived. Results. Only CS was detected with a derived column density of cm . We report a first tentative detection of SO in DM Tau. The upper limits range between and cm for the other S-bearing species. The best-fit chemical model matching these values requires a gas-phase C/O ratio of > 1 at au. With chemical modeling we demonstrate that sulfur-bearing species could be robust tracers of the gas-phase C/O ratio, surface reaction rates, grain size and UV intensities. Conclusions. The lack of detections of a variety of sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of reactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or because most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in comets. The inferred high CS/SO and CS/SO ratios require a non-solar C/O gas-phase ratio of > 1, consistent with the recent observations of hydrocarbon rings in DM Tau. The stronger depletion of oxygen-bearing S-species compared to CS is likely linked to the low observed abundances of gaseous water in DM Tau and points to a removal mechanism of oxygen from the gas."

Several basic quantities (e.g., mass number and proton number of projectile and target) and the CS obtained from phenomenological formula are fed into the LightGBM algorithm to predict the CS. It is found that, on the validation set, the mean absolute error (MAE) which measures the average magnitude of the absolute difference between of the predicted CS and experimental CS is 0.129 by only using the basic quantities as the input, this value is smaller than 0.154 obtained from the empirical coupled channel model. MAE can be further reduced to 0.08 by including an physical-informed input feature. The MAE on the test set (it consists of 280 data points from 18 reaction systems that not included in the training set) is about 0.19 and 0.53 by including and excluding the physical-informed feature, respectively. We further verify the LightGBM predictions by comparing the CS of + obtained from the density-constrained time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach. Our study demonstrates the importance of physical information in predicting fusion cross section of heavy-ion reaction with machine learning."

Our proposed method utilizes ideas from classical dictionary-based CS and, in particular, sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), to integrate a strong regularization towards sparse solutions. At the same time, by leveraging the notion of conditional Gaussianity, it also incorporates the adaptability from generative models to training data. However, unlike most state-of-the-art generative models, it is able to learn from a few compressed and noisy data samples and requires no optimization algorithm for solving the inverse problem. Additionally, similar to Dirichlet prior networks, our model parameterizes a conjugate prior enabling its application for uncertainty quantification. We support our approach theoretically through the concept of variational inference and validate it empirically using different types of compressible signals."

We show that in this \"phase-only compressive sensing\" (PO-CS) scenario, we can perfectly recover such a signal with high probability and up to global unknown amplitude if the sensing matrix is a complex Gaussian random matrix and if the number of measurements is large compared to the complexity level of the signal space. Our approach proceeds by recasting the (non-linear) PO-CS scheme as a linear compressive sensing model built from a signal normalization constraint, and a phase-consistency constraint imposing any signal estimate to match the observed phases in the measurement domain. Practically, stable and robust signal direction estimation is achieved from any \"instance optimal\" algorithm of the compressive sensing literature (such as basis pursuit denoising). This is ensured by proving that the matrix associated with this equivalent linear model satisfies with high probability the restricted isometry property under the above condition on the number of measurements. We finally observe experimentally that robust signal direction recovery is reached at about twice the number of measurements needed for signal recovery in compressive sensing."

    "summary": "The majority of planetary nebulae (PNe) are not spherical, and current single-star models cannot adequately explain all the morphologies we observe. This has led to the Binary Hypothesis, which states that PNe are preferentially formed by binary systems. This hypothesis can be corroborated or disproved by comparing the estimated binary fraction of all PNe central stars (CS) to that of the supposed progenitor population. One way to quantify the rate of CS binarity is to detect near infra-red (IR) excess indicative of a low-mass main sequence companion. In this paper, a sample of known PNe within data release 2 of the ongoing VPHAS+ are investigated. We give details of the method used to calibrate VPHAS+ photometry, and present the expected colours of CS and main sequence stars within the survey. Objects were scrutinized to remove PN mimics from our sample and identify true CS. Within our final sample of 7 CS, 6 had previously either not been identified or confirmed. We detected an band excess indicative of a low-mass companion star in 3 CS, including one known binary, leading us to to conclude that VPHAS+ provides the precise photometry required for the IR excess method presented here, and will likely improve as the survey completes and the calibration process finalised. Given the promising results from this trial sample, the entire VPHAS+ catalogue should be used to study PNe and extend the IR excess-tested CS sample."

During the luminous phase (first 100 d) the line profiles are composed of three major components: (i) narrow P-Cygni lines with the absorption minima at -700 km/s; (ii) broad emission lines with BVZI ~4000 km/s; and (iii) broad, smooth wings, most apparent in H-alpha. These components are identified with an expanding circumstellar (CS) envelope, shocked cool gas in the forward post-shock region, and multiple Thomson scattering in the CS envelope, respectively. The absence of broad P-Cygni lines from the supernova is the result of the formation of an optically thick, cool, dense shell at the interface of the ejecta and the CS envelope. We model the supernova deceleration and Thomson scattering wings to recover the density, radial extent and Thomson optical depth of the CS envelope during the first month. We reproduce the light curve with a hydrodynamical model and find it to be powered by a combination of internal energy leakage after the explosion of an extended pre-supernova (~10^15 cm) and luminosity from circumstellar interaction. We recover the pre-explosion kinematics of the CS envelope: it is close to homologous expansion with outer velocity ~1100 km/s and a kinematic age of ~1.5 yr. The CS envelope's high mass and kinetic energy, combined with its small age, strongly suggest that the CS envelope was explosively ejected about 1.5 yr before the supernova explosion."

Previous works have largely focused on predicting crime events with historical crime data. The usage of large-scale mobility data collected from Location-Based Social Network, or check-ins, and Point of Interests (POI) data for designing an effective police patrol is largely understudied. Given that there are multiple police officers being on duty in a real-life situation, this makes the problem more complex to solve. In this paper, we formulate the dynamic crime patrol planning problem for multiple police officers using check-ins, crime, incident response data, and POI information. We propose a joint learning and non-random optimisation method for the representation of possible solutions where multiple police officers patrol the high crime risk areas simultaneously first rather than the low crime risk areas. Later, meta-heuristic Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Cuckoo Search (CS) are implemented to find the optimal routes. The performance of the proposed solution is verified and compared with several state-of-art methods using real-world datasets."

    "title": "Recent progress on scaling algorithms and applications",
    "summary": "Scaling problems have a rich and diverse history, and thereby have found numerous applications in several fields of science and engineering. For instance, the matrix scaling problem has had applications ranging from theoretical computer science to telephone forecasting, economics, statistics, optimization, among many other fields. Recently, a generalization of matrix scaling known as operator scaling has found applications in non-commutative algebra, invariant theory, combinatorics and algebraic complexity; and a further generalization (tensor scaling) has found more applications in quantum information theory, geometric complexity theory and invariant theory. In this survey, we will describe in detail the scaling problems mentioned above, showing how alternating minimization algorithms naturally arise in this setting, and we shall present a general framework to rigorously analyze such algorithms. These simple problems and algorithms are not just applicable to diverse mathematical and CS areas, but also serve to bring out deep connections between them. As this framework makes extensive use of concepts from invariant theory, we also provide a very gentle introduction to basic concepts of invariant theory and how they are used to analyze alternating minimization algorithms for the scaling problems. This survey is intended for a general computer science audience, and the only background required is basic knowledge of calculus and linear algebra, thereby making it accessible to graduate students and even to advanced undergraduates."

    "title": "Restricted Structural Random Matrix for Compressive Sensing",
    "summary": "Compressive sensing (CS) is well-known for its unique functionalities of sensing, compressing, and security (i.e. CS measurements are equally important). However, there is a tradeoff. Improving sensing and compressing efficiency with prior signal information tends to favor particular measurements, thus decrease the security. This work aimed to improve the sensing and compressing efficiency without compromise the security with a novel sampling matrix, named Restricted Structural Random Matrix (RSRM). RSRM unified the advantages of frame-based and block-based sensing together with the global smoothness prior (i.e. low-resolution signals are highly correlated). RSRM acquired compressive measurements with random projection (equally important) of multiple randomly sub-sampled signals, which was restricted to be the low-resolution signals (equal in energy), thereby, its observations are equally important. RSRM was proven to satisfies the Restricted Isometry Property and shows comparable reconstruction performance with recent state-of-the-art compressive sensing and deep learning-based methods."

    "title": "Multi-sequence Spreading Random Access (MSRA) for Compressive Sensing-based Grant-free Communication",
    "summary": "The performance of grant-free random access (GF-RA) is limited by the number of accessible random access resources (RRs) due to the absence of collision resolution. Compressive sensing (CS)-based RA schemes scale up the RRs at the expense of increased non-orthogonality among transmitted signals. This paper presents the design of multi-sequence spreading random access (MSRA) which employs multiple spreading sequences to spread the different symbols of a user as opposed to the conventional schemes in which a user employs the same spreading sequence for each symbol. We show that MSRA provides code diversity, enabling the multi-user detection (MUD) to be modeled into a well-conditioned multiple measurement vector (MMV) CS problem. The code diversity is quantified by the decrease in the average Babel mutual coherence among the spreading sequences. Moreover, we present a two-stage active user detection (AUD) scheme for both wideband and narrowband implementation. Our theoretical analysis shows that with MSRA activity misdetection falls exponentially while the size of GF-RA frame is increased. Finally, the simulation results show that about 82% increase in utilization of RRs, i.e., more active users, is supported by MSRA than the conventional schemes while achieving the RA failure rate lower bound set by random access collision."

    "summary": "The ITER Heating Neutral Beam (HNB) injector is required to deliver 16.7 MW power into the plasma from a neutralised beam of H-/D- negative ions, produced by an RF source and accelerated up to 1 MeV. To enhance the H-/D- production, the surface of the acceleration system grid facing the source (the plasma grid) will be coated with Cs because of its low work function. Cs will be routinely evaporated in the source by means of specific ovens. Monitoring the evaporation rate and the distribution of Cs inside the source is fundamental to get the desired performances on the ITER HNB. In order to proper design the source of the ITER HNB and to identify the best operation practices for it, the prototype RF negative ion source SPIDER has been developed and built in the Neutral Beam Test Facility at Consorzio RFX. A Laser Absorption Spectroscopy diagnostic will be installed in SPIDER for a quantitative estimation of Cs density. By using a wavelength tunable laser, the diagnostic will measure the absorption spectrum of the 852 nm line along 4 lines of sight, parallel to the plasma grid surface and close to it. From the absorption spectra the line-integrated density of Cs at ground state will be measured. The design of this diagnostic for SPIDER is presented, with details of the layout and of the key components. A preliminary installation of the diagnostic on the test stand for Cs ovens is also described, together with its first experimental results; the effect of ground state depopulation on collected measurements is discussed and partially corrected."

We study scaling laws for HPs: formulas for how to scale HPs as we scale model size N, dataset size D, and batch size B. Recent work suggests the AdamW timescale, , should remain constant across training settings, and we verify the implication that optimal scales linearly with B, for a fixed N and D. However, as N and D scale, we show optimal obeys a precise power law in the tokens-per-parameter ratio, D/N. This law thus provides a method to accurately predict opt in advance of large-scale training. We also study scaling laws for optimal batch size Bopt (the B enabling lowest loss at a given N,D) and critical batch size Bcrit (the B beyond which further data parallelism becomes ineffective). In contrast to prior work, we find both Bopt and Bcrit scale as power laws in D, independent of model size, N. Finally, we analyze how these findings inform the real-world selection of Pareto-optimal N and D under dual training time and compute objectives. All experiments were run on Cerebras CS-3 systems."

We first establish a global-in-time existence of measure-valued solutions to the kinetic CS equation. For this, we use a proper change of variable to reformulate the particle CS model as a first-order particle system and provide the uniform-in-time stability for that particle system. We then extend this stability estimate for the singular CS particle system. By using that stability estimate, we construct the measure-valued solutions to the kinetic CS equation globally in time. Moreover, as a direct application of the uniform-in-time stability estimate, we show the quantitative uniform-in-time mean-field limit from the particle system to that kinetic CS equation in -Wasserstein distance with . Our result gives the uniqueness of measure-valued solution in the sense of mean-field limits, i.e., the measure-valued solutions, approximated by the empirical measures associated to the particle system, uniquely exist. Similar results for the first-order model also follow as a by-product. We also reformulate the continuity-type equation, which is derived from the first-order model, as an integro-differential equation by employing the pseudo-inverse of the accumulative particle distribution. By making use of a modified -Wasserstein distance, we provide the contractivity estimate for absolutely continuous solutions of the continuum equation."

To this end we generalize the known spin equation (SE) to an infinite-dimensional Fock space. The equation describes a special quadratic system in the latter space. Its projections on -dimensional subspaces, represent analogs of SE for -dimensional systems in an external electromagnetic field which describe -dimensional systems with a given angular moment. Using a modification of Malkin-Manko method developed in our earlier work, we construct the corresponding CS for the total quadratic system. Projections of the later CS on finite-dimensional subspaces we call angular moment CS (AMCS) of finite-level systems. The AMCS have a clear physical meaning, they obey the Schrödinger for a -dimensional system with a given angular moment in an external electromagnetic field. Their possible exact solutions are constructed via exact solutions of the SE in -dimensional space. The latter solutions can be found analytically and are completely described in our earlier works. A one subset of AMCS can be related to Perelomov spinning CS (PSCS). This reflects the fact that the set of possible AMCS is wider than the set of PSCS. AMCS states in a constant magnetic field are constructed. Some of them coincide with the Bloch CS."

Targeted at the German NLP community, the model also promotes Bavarian as a low-resource language. Development tackled four challenges: (1) curating a multilingual corpus despite Bavarian scarcity, (2) creating a unified tokenizer for English, German, and Bavarian, (3) optimizing architecture and language-ratio hyperparameters for cross-lingual transfer, and (4) establishing the first standardized trilingual evaluation suite by translating German benchmarks into Bavarian. Evaluations show that Llama-GENBA-10B achieves strong cross-lingual performance, with the fine-tuned variant surpassing Apertus-8B-2509 and gemma-2-9b in Bavarian and establishing itself as the best model in its class for this language, while also outperforming EuroLLM in English and matching its results in German.

    "summary": "Recent deep network-based compressive sensing (CS) methods have achieved great success. However, most of them regard different sampling matrices as different independent tasks and need to train a specific model for each target sampling matrix. Such practices give rise to inefficiency in computing and suffer from poor generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a novel COntrollable Arbitrary-Sampling neTwork, dubbed COAST, to solve CS problems of arbitrary-sampling matrices (including unseen sampling matrices) with one single model. Under the optimization-inspired deep unfolding framework, our COAST exhibits good interpretability. In COAST, a random projection augmentation (RPA) strategy is proposed to promote the training diversity in the sampling space to enable arbitrary sampling, and a controllable proximal mapping module (CPMM) and a plug-and-play deblocking (PnP-D) strategy are further developed to dynamically modulate the network features and effectively eliminate the blocking artifacts, respectively. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed COAST is not only able to handle arbitrary sampling matrices with one single model but also to achieve state-of-the-art performance with fast speed.

    "title": "Compressive Sensing-Based Detection with Multimodal Dependent Data",
    "summary": "Detection with high dimensional multimodal data is a challenging problem when there are complex inter- and intra- modal dependencies. While several approaches have been proposed for dependent data fusion (e.g., based on copula theory), their advantages come at a high price in terms of computational complexity. In this paper, we treat the detection problem with compressive sensing (CS) where compression at each sensor is achieved via low dimensional random projections. CS has recently been exploited to solve detection problems under various assumptions on the signals of interest, however, its potential for dependent data fusion has not been explored adequately. We exploit the capability of CS to capture statistical properties of uncompressed data in order to compute decision statistics for detection in the compressed domain. First, a Gaussian approximation is employed to perform likelihood ratio (LR) based detection with compressed data. In this approach, inter-modal dependence is captured via a compressed version of the covariance matrix of the concatenated (temporally and spatially) uncompressed data vector. We show that, under certain conditions, this approach with a small number of compressed measurements per node leads to enhanced performance compared to detection with uncompressed data using widely considered suboptimal approaches. Second, we develop a nonparametric approach where a decision statistic based on the second order statistics of uncompressed data is computed in the compressed domain. The second approach is promising over other related nonparametric approaches and the first approach when multimodal data is highly correlated at the expense of slightly increased computational complexity."

    "summary": "Compressive sensing (CS), acquiring and reconstructing signals below the Nyquist rate, has great potential in image and video acquisition to exploit data redundancy and greatly reduce the amount of sampled data. To further reduce the sampled data while keeping the video quality, this paper explores the temporal redundancy in video CS and proposes a block based adaptive compressive sensing framework with a sampling rate (SR) control strategy. To avoid redundant compression of non-moving regions, we first incorporate moving block detection between consecutive frames, and only transmit the measurements of moving blocks. The non-moving regions are reconstructed from the previous frame. In addition, we propose a block storage system and a dynamic threshold to achieve adaptive SR allocation to each frame based on the area of moving regions and target SR for controlling the average SR within the target SR. Finally, to reduce blocking artifacts and improve reconstruction quality, we adopt a cooperative reconstruction of the moving and non-moving blocks by referring to the measurements of the non-moving blocks from the previous frame. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that this work is able to control SR and obtain better performance than existing works."

    "summary": "The spreading of the X-line out of the reconnection plane under a strong guide field is investigated using large-scale three-dimensional (3D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations in asymmetric magnetic reconnection. A simulation with a thick, ion-scale equilibrium current sheet (CS) reveals that the X-line spreads at the ambient ion/electron drift speeds, significantly slower than the Alfvén speed based on the guide field . Additional simulations with a thinner, sub-ion-scale CS show that the X-line spreads at (Alfvénic spreading), much higher than the ambient species drifts. An Alfvénic signal consistent with kinetic Alfvén waves develops and propagates, leading to CS thinning and extending, which then results in reconnection onset. The continuous onset of reconnection in the signal propagation direction manifests as Alfvénic X-line spreading. The strong dependence on the CS thickness of the spreading speeds, and the X-line orientation are consistent with the collisionless tearing instability. Our simulations indicate that when the collisionless tearing growth is sufficiently strong in a thinner CS such that , Alfvénic X-line spreading can take place. Our results compare favorably with a number of numerical simulations and recent magnetopause observations. A key implications is that the magnetopause CS is typically too thick for Alfvénic X-line spreading to effectively take place."

Recently, a more powerful approach has been proposed, called flexible coinduction, to express a variety of intermediate interpretations, necessary in some cases to get the correct meaning. We provide a detailed formal account of an extension of logic programming supporting flexible coinduction. Syntactically, programs are enriched by coclauses, clauses with a special meaning used to tune the interpretation of predicates. As usual, the declarative semantics can be expressed as a fixed point which, however, is not necessarily the least, nor the greatest one, but is determined by the coclauses. Correspondingly, the operational semantics is a combination of standard SLD resolution and coSLD resolution. We prove that the operational semantics is sound and complete with respect to declarative semantics restricted to finite comodels. This paper is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP."

    "summary": "Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) are the most common class of core-collapse SNe. They often show rapid increase of polarization degree in the late phase. This time evolution is generally believed to originate from the emergence of an inner aspherical core, while an effect of polarized-scattered echoes by circumstellar (CS) dust around the SN may also substantially contribute to this polarization feature. In this study, we examine the effects of the scatted echoes on the SN polarization through radiative transfer simulations for various geometry and amount of CS dust. It has been found that asymmetrically-distributed CS dust, which is generally inferred for red supergiants, could reproduce the observed polarization features. We have applied our results to SNe 2004dj and 2006ov, deriving the geometry and amount of CS dust to explain their observed polarization features in this scenario. For both SNe, the blob-like or bipolar distribution of CS dust rather than the disk-like distribution is favored. The derived dust mass in the blob model (the bipolar CS dust model) for SNe 2004dj and 2006ov are M ( M ) and M ( M ), respectively. Even in the case where this process would not play a dominant role in the observed polarization signals, this effect should in principle contribute to it, the strength of which depends on the nature of CS dust. Therefore, this effect must be taken into account in discussing multi-dimensional structure of an SN explosion through polarimetric observations."

    "summary": "Conventional Glauber coherent states (CS) can be defined in several equivalent ways, e.g., by displacing the vacuum or, explicitly, by their infinite Poissonian expansion in Fock states. It is well known that these definitions become inequivalent if applied to finite -level systems (qudits). We present a comparative Wigner-function description of the qudit CS defined (i) by the action of the truncated displacement operator on the vacuum and (ii) by the Poissonian expansion in Fock states of the Glauber CS truncated at -photon Fock state. These states can be generated from a classical light by its optical truncation using nonlinear and linear quantum scissors devices, respectively. We show a surprising effect that a macroscopically distinguishable superposition of two qudit CS (according to both definitions) can be generated with high fidelity by displacing the vacuum in the qudit Hilbert space. If the qudit dimension is even (odd) then the superposition state contains Fock states with only odd (even) photon numbers, which can be referred to as the odd (even) qudit CS or the female (male) Schrödinger cat state. This phenomenon can be interpreted as an interference of a single CS with its reflection from the highest-energy Fock state of the Hilbert space, as clearly seen via phase-space interference of the Wigner function. We also analyze nonclassical properties of the qudit CS including their photon-number statistics and nonclassical volume of the Wigner function, which is a quantitative parameter of nonclassicality (quantumness) of states. Finally, we study optical tomograms, which can be directly measured in the homodyne detection of the analyzed qudit cat states and enable the complete reconstructions of their Wigner functions."

They extend the standard CS paradigm from sampling discrete, finite dimensional signals to sampling continuous and possibly infinite dimensional ones, and thus establish the ability to capture these signals at sub-Nyquist sampling rates. The RD and the MWC have remarkably similar structures (similar block diagrams), but their reconstruction algorithms and signal models strongly differ. To date, few results exist that compare these systems, and owing to the potential impacts they could have on spectral estimation in applications like electromagnetic scanning and cognitive radio, we more fully investigate their relationship in this paper. We show that the RD and the MWC are both based on the general concept of random filtering, but employ significantly different sampling functions. We also investigate system sensitivities (or robustness) to sparse signal model assumptions. Lastly, we show that \"block convolution\" is a fundamental aspect of the MWC, allowing it to successfully sample and reconstruct block-sparse (multiband) signals. Based on this concept, we propose a new acquisition system for continuous-time signals whose amplitudes are block sparse. The paper includes detailed time and frequency domain analyses of the RD and the MWC that differ, sometimes substantially, from published results."

Moreover, our CS kernel depends logarithmically on the large quark transverse separation, providing a key constraint on its phenomenological parametrization. Finally, a lattice calculation can be directly compared to our generic results in Euclidean signature, thus providing a new approach for evaluating the soft function and extracting the CS kernel by analytical continuation."

These data are supplemented by multi-color Pan-STARRS1 and CTIO 4-m DECam observations obtained within hours of explosion. The K2 light curve has an unusual two-component shape, where the flux rises with a steep linear gradient for the first few days, followed by a quadratic rise as seen for typical SNe Ia. This \"flux excess\" relative to canonical SN Ia behavior is confirmed in our -band light curve, and furthermore, SN 2018oh is especially blue during the early epochs. The flux excess peaks 2.14 days after explosion, has a FWHM of 3.12 days, a blackbody temperature of K, a peak luminosity of , and a total integrated energy of . We compare SN 2018oh to several models that may provide additional heating at early times, including collision with a companion and a shallow concentration of radioactive nickel. While all of these models generally reproduce the early K2 light curve shape, we slightly favor a companion interaction, at a distance of based on our early color measurements, although the exact distance depends on the uncertain viewing angle. Additional confirmation of a companion interaction in future modeling and observations of SN 2018oh would provide strong support for a single-degenerate progenitor system."

    "summary": "To fully utilize the spatial multiplexing gains or array gains of massive MIMO, the channel state information must be obtained at the transmitter side (CSIT). However, conventional CSIT estimation approaches are not suitable for FDD massive MIMO systems because of the overwhelming training and feedback overhead. In this paper, we consider multi-user massive MIMO systems and deploy the compressive sensing (CS) technique to reduce the training as well as the feedback overhead in the CSIT estimation. The multi-user massive MIMO systems exhibits a hidden joint sparsity structure in the user channel matrices due to the shared local scatterers in the physical propagation environment. As such, instead of naively applying the conventional CS to the CSIT estimation, we propose a distributed compressive CSIT estimation scheme so that the compressed measurements are observed at the users locally, while the CSIT recovery is performed at the base station jointly. A joint orthogonal matching pursuit recovery algorithm is proposed to perform the CSIT recovery, with the capability of exploiting the hidden joint sparsity in the user channel matrices. We analyze the obtained CSIT quality in terms of the normalized mean absolute error, and through the closed-form expressions, we obtain simple insights into how the joint channel sparsity can be exploited to improve the CSIT recovery performance."

Since these nontrivial results are essentially because of the CS term, hence, we first discuss in some detail the various properties of the CS term in two space dimensions. In particular, it is pointed out that this parity (P) and time reversal (T) violating but gauge invariant term when added to the Maxwell Lagrangian gives a massive gauge quanta and yet the theory is still gauge invariant. Further, the vacuum of such a theory shows the magneto-electric effect. Besides, we show that the CS term can also be generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking as well as by radiative corrections. A detailed discussion about Coleman-Hill theorem is also given which aserts that the parity-odd piece of the vacuum polarization tensor at zero momentum transfer is unaffected by two and multi-loop effects. Topological quantization of the coefficient of the CS term in nonabelian gauge theories is also elaborated in some detail. One of the dramatic effect of the CS term is that the vortices of the abelian (as well as nonabelian) Higgs model now acquire finite quantized charge and angular momentum. The various properties of these vortices are discussed at length with special emphasis on some of the recent developments including the discovery of the self-dual charged vortex solutions."

Our analyses demonstrate the consistency of different lattice extractions of the CS kernel for mesons and baryons, as well as for twist-two and twist-three operators, even though lattice artifacts could be significant. This consistency corroborates the universality of the lattice-determined CS kernel and suggests that a high-precision determination of it is in reach."

    "summary": "CONTEXT: The chemistry in the inner few thousand AU of accreting envelopes around young stellar objects is predicted to vary greatly with far-UV and X-ray irradiation by the central star. Aim We search for molecular tracers of high-energy irradiation by the protostar in the hot inner envelope. METHODS: The Submillimeter Array (SMA) has observed the high-mass star forming region AFGL 2591 in lines of CS, SO, HCN, HCN(v2=1), and HC15N with 0.6\" resolution at 350 GHz probing radial scales of 600-3500 AU for an assumed distance of 1 kpc. The SMA observations are compared with the predictions of a chemical model fitted to previous single-dish observations. RESULTS: The CS and SO main peaks are extended in space at the FWHM level, as predicted in the model assuming protostellar X-rays. However, the main peak sizes are found smaller than modeled by nearly a factor of 2. On the other hand, the lines of CS, HCN, and HC15N, but not SO and HCN(v2=1), show pedestal emissions at radii of about 3500 AU that are not predicted. All lines except SO show a secondary peak within the approaching outflow cone. A dip or null in the visibilities caused by a sharp decrease in abundance with increasing radius is not observed in CS and only tentatively in SO. CONCLUSIONS: The emission of protostellar X-rays is supported by the good fit of the modeled SO and CS amplitude visibilities including an extended main peak in CS. The broad pedestals can be interpreted by far-UV irradiation in a spherically non-symmetric geometry, possibly comprising outflow walls on scales of 3500 -- 7000 AU. The extended CS and SO main peaks suggest sulfur evaporation near the 100 K temperature radius."

    "summary": "Despite significant effort in understanding complex systems (CS), we lack a theory for modeling, inference, analysis and efficient control of time-varying complex networks (TVCNs) in uncertain environments. From brain activity dynamics to microbiome, and even chromatin interactions within the genome architecture, many such TVCNs exhibits a pronounced spatio-temporal fractality. Moreover, for many TVCNs only limited information (e.g., few variables) is accessible for modeling, which hampers the capabilities of analytical tools to uncover the true degrees of freedom and infer the CS model, the hidden states and their parameters. Another fundamental limitation is that of understanding and unveiling of unknown drivers of the dynamics that could sporadically excite the network in ways that straightforward modeling does not work due to our inability to model non-stationary processes. Towards addressing these challenges, in this paper, we consider the problem of learning the fractional dynamical complex networks under unknown unknowns (i.e., hidden drivers) and partial observability (i.e., only partial data is available). More precisely, we consider a generalized modeling approach of TVCNs consisting of discrete-time fractional dynamical equations and propose an iterative framework to determine the network parameterization and predict the state of the system. We showcase the performance of the proposed framework in the context of task classification using real electroencephalogram data."

    "title": "Motion Compensated Dynamic MRI Reconstruction with Local Affine Optical Flow Estimation",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a novel framework to reconstruct the dynamic magnetic resonance images (DMRI) with motion compensation (MC). Due to the inherent motion effects during DMRI acquisition, reconstruction of DMRI using motion estimation/compensation (ME/MC) has been studied under a compressed sensing (CS) scheme. In this paper, by embedding the intensity-based optical flow (OF) constraint into the traditional CS scheme, we are able to couple the DMRI reconstruction with motion field estimation. The formulated optimization problem is solved by a primal-dual algorithm with linesearch due to its efficiency when dealing with non-differentiable problems. With the estimated motion field, the DMRI reconstruction is refined through MC. By employing the multi-scale coarse-to-fine strategy, we are able to update the variables(temporal image sequences and motion vectors) and to refine the image reconstruction alternately. Moreover, the proposed framework is capable of handling a wide class of prior information (regularizations) for DMRI reconstruction, such as sparsity, low rank and total variation. Experiments on various DMRI data, ranging from in vivo lung to cardiac dataset, validate the reconstruction quality improvement using the proposed scheme in comparison to several state-of-the-art algorithms."

    "title": "Adaptive Selection of Sampling-Reconstruction in Fourier Compressed Sensing",
    "summary": "Compressed sensing (CS) has emerged to overcome the inefficiency of Nyquist sampling. However, traditional optimization-based reconstruction is slow and can not yield an exact image in practice. Deep learning-based reconstruction has been a promising alternative to optimization-based reconstruction, outperforming it in accuracy and computation speed. Finding an efficient sampling method with deep learning-based reconstruction, especially for Fourier CS remains a challenge. Existing joint optimization of sampling-reconstruction works ( ) optimize the sampling mask but have low potential as it is not adaptive to each data point. Adaptive sampling ( ) has also disadvantages of difficult optimization and Pareto sub-optimality. Here, we propose a novel adaptive selection of sampling-reconstruction ( ) framework that selects the best sampling mask and reconstruction network for each input data. We provide theorems that our method has a higher potential than and effectively solves the Pareto sub-optimality problem in sampling-reconstruction by using separate reconstruction networks for different sampling masks. To select the best sampling mask, we propose to quantify the high-frequency Bayesian uncertainty of the input, using a super-resolution space generation model. Our method outperforms joint optimization of sampling-reconstruction ( ) and adaptive sampling ( ) by achieving significant improvements on several Fourier CS problems."

The innovative methodology proposed for this quantification is based on incremental least-cost expansion of the distribution system, encompassing both traditional and non-traditional grid upgrade strategies. Realistic infrastructure investment costs are obtained using a dataset of over 2,500 feeders, including various loading scenarios, and compared with empirical costs of integrating real CS projects. The results are then used to evaluate costs and deferrals from the consumers' and project developers' perspectives, assess the nature of the infrastructure upgrades and explore the potential benefits of a strategic siting of CS projects. This analysis is summarized in a set of regulatory and policy recommendations to support planning and valuation aspects related to CS."

In addition, wavelet based CS approximations, founded on a new continuous CS approach, are used to construct continuous spectra that are compatible with variable transformations to the energy/momentum transfer domain.

For example, Gentzen's classical and intuitionistic calculi LK and LJ enjoy cut elimination. The property is less studied in coinductive extensions of sequent calculi. In this paper, we use coinductive Horn clause theories to show that cut is not eliminable in a coinductive extension of LJ, a system we call CLJ. We derive two further practical results from this study. We show that CoLP by Gupta et al. gives rise to cut-free proofs in CLJ with fixpoint terms, and we formulate and implement a novel method of coinductive theory exploration that provides several heuristics for discovery of cut formulae in CLJ."

While Conformal Selection (CS) provides rigorous uncertainty quantification, it is limited to univariate responses and scalar criteria. To address this issue, we propose Multivariate Conformal Selection (mCS), a generalization of CS designed for multivariate response settings. Our method introduces regional monotonicity and employs multivariate nonconformity scores to construct conformal p-values, enabling finite-sample False Discovery Rate (FDR) control. We present two variants: mCS-dist, using distance-based scores, and mCS-learn, which learns optimal scores via differentiable optimization. Experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that mCS significantly improves selection power while maintaining FDR control, establishing it as a robust framework for multivariate selection tasks."

These CS quivers come from R-R gauge fields interacting with D6-branes wrapped on 4-cycles, which reside within a blown up CP^3 projective space. Based on the CS quiver method and mimicking the construction of del Pezzo surfaces in terms of CP^2, we first give a model which corresponds to a single layer model of FQHS system, then we propose a multi-layer system generalizing the doubled CS field theory, which is used in the study of topological defect in graphene."

    "summary": "Magnetic racetrack memory has significantly evolved and developed since its first experimental verification and is considered as one of the most promising candidates for future high-density on-chip solid state memory. However, the lack of a fast and precise magnetic domain wall (DW) shifting mechanism and the required extremely high DW motion (DWM) driving current both make the racetrack difficult to commercialize. Here, we propose a method for coherent DWM that is free from above issues, which is driven by chirality switching (CS) and an ultralow spin-orbit-torque (SOT) current. The CS, as the driving force of DWM, is achieved by the sign change of DM interaction which is further induced by a ferroelectric switching voltage. The SOT is used to break the symmetry when the magnetic moment is rotated to the Bloch direction. We numerically investigate the underlying principle and the effect of key parameters on the DWM through micromagnetic simulations. Under the CS mechanism, a fast (102 m/s), ultralow energy (5 attojoule), and precisely discretized DWM can be achieved. Considering that skyrmions with topological protection and smaller size are also promising for future racetrack, we similarly evaluate the feasibility of applying such a CS mechanism to a skyrmion. However, we find that the CS only causes it to \"breathe\" instead of moving. Our results demonstrate that the CS strategy is suitable for future DW racetrack memory with ultralow power consumption and discretized DWM."

Two numerical criteria were set to evaluate the performance of different CS algorithms: Compression Ratio (CR) and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). In order to do this, individual CS algorithm testing platforms for the EEG data were constructed within MATLAB scheme. The main considerations for the project were the following. 1) Feasibility of the dictionary 2) Tolerance to non-sparsity 3) Applicability of thresholding or interpolation."

Based on this, deploying a fleet of autonomous robots to work alongside farmworkers may provide vast productivity and logistics benefits. Then, an intelligent robotic system should monitor human behavior, identify the ongoing activities and anticipate the worker's needs. In this work, the main contribution consists of creating a benchmark model for video-based human pickers detection, classifying their activities to serve in harvesting operations for different agricultural scenarios. Our solution uses the combination of a Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN) for object detection and optical flow for motion estimation with newly added statistical attributes of flow motion descriptors, named as Correlation Sensitivity (CS). A classification criterion is defined based on the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) analysis and K-means clustering algorithm, which are implemented upon in-house collected dataset from different crop fields like strawberry polytunnels and apple tree orchards. The proposed framework is quantitatively analyzed using sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy measures and shows satisfactory results amidst various dataset challenges such as lighting variation, blur, and occlusions."

The input language of eclingo uses the syntax extension capabilities of clingo to define subjective literals that, as usual in epistemic logic programs, allow for checking the truth of a regular literal in all or in some of the answer sets of a program. The eclingo solving process follows a guess and check strategy. It first generates potential truth values for subjective literals and, in a second step, it checks the obtained result with respect to the cautious and brave consequences of the program. This process is implemented using the multi-shot functionalities of clingo. We have also implemented some optimisations, aiming at reducing the search space and, therefore, increasing eclingo's efficiency in some scenarios. Finally, we compare the efficiency of eclingo with two state-of-the-art solvers for epistemic logic programs on a pair of benchmark scenarios and show that eclingo generally outperforms their obtained results.

While ethics has received growing attention in computer science (CS) education more broadly, the specific pedagogical treatment of AI ethics remains under-examined. This study addresses that gap through a large-scale analysis of 3,395 publicly accessible syllabi from CS and allied areas at leading Indian institutions. Among them, only 75 syllabi (2.21%) included any substantive AI ethics content. Three key findings emerged: (1) AI ethics is typically integrated as a minor module within broader technical courses rather than as a standalone course; (2) ethics coverage is often limited to just one or two instructional sessions; and (3) recurring topics include algorithmic fairness, privacy and data governance, transparency, and societal impact. While these themes reflect growing awareness, current curricular practices reveal limited depth and consistency. This work highlights both the progress and the gaps in preparing future technologists to engage meaningfully with the ethical dimensions of AI, and it offers suggestions to strengthen the integration of AI ethics within computing curricula."

In this framework, a multi-functional base station (BS) carries out target sensing, while providing edge computing services to the nearby users. To enhance the computation efficiency, the multi-tier computing structure is exploited, where the BS can further offload the computation tasks to a powerful Cloud server (CS). The potential benefits of employing NOMA in the proposed JCSMC framework are investigated, which can maximize the computation offloading capacity and suppress the inter-function interference. Based on the proposed framework, the transmit beamformer of the BS and computation resource allocation at the BS and the CS are jointly optimized to maximize the computation rate subject to the communication-computation causality and the sensing quality constraints. Both partial and binary computation offloading modes are considered: 1) For the partial offloading mode, a weighted minimum mean square error based alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the corresponding non-convex optimization problem. It is proved that a KKT optimal solution can be obtained; 2) For the binary offloading mode, the resultant highly-coupled mixed-integer optimization problem is first transformed to an equivalent but more tractable form. Then, the reformulated problem is solved by utilizing the alternating direction method of multipliers approach to obtain a nearly optimal solution.

    "title": "Structured Sparsity: Discrete and Convex approaches",
    "summary": "Compressive sensing (CS) exploits sparsity to recover sparse or compressible signals from dimensionality reducing, non-adaptive sensing mechanisms. Sparsity is also used to enhance interpretability in machine learning and statistics applications: While the ambient dimension is vast in modern data analysis problems, the relevant information therein typically resides in a much lower dimensional space. However, many solutions proposed nowadays do not leverage the true underlying structure. Recent results in CS extend the simple sparsity idea to more sophisticated structured sparsity models, which describe the interdependency between the nonzero components of a signal, allowing to increase the interpretability of the results and lead to better recovery performance. In order to better understand the impact of structured sparsity, in this chapter we analyze the connections between the discrete models and their convex relaxations, highlighting their relative advantages. We start with the general group sparse model and then elaborate on two important special cases: the dispersive and the hierarchical models. For each, we present the models in their discrete nature, discuss how to solve the ensuing discrete problems and then describe convex relaxations. We also consider more general structures as defined by set functions and present their convex proxies. Further, we discuss efficient optimization solutions for structured sparsity problems and illustrate structured sparsity in action via three applications."

Despite this history, a human-centered evaluation of these type systems and their usability was all but absent, with empirical evaluations limited to testing their expressiveness in programs written by experts, i.e. the creators of the type system. In the past few years, this has begun to change with the adoption of a version of affine types and ownership in the popular Rust programming language. With the increase in Rust's popularity, various studies have begun empirically evaluating the usability of Rust's Ownership and Lifetime rules, providing a breadth of qualitative and quantitative information on the usability of such type systems. They found that despite Rust's general success in achieving its promise of safety and performance, these rules come with a steep learning curve and have been repeatedly cited as a barrier to adopting Rust. In this report, I provide a brief history of linear types and region-based memory management, which directly inspired Rust's type system. I then introduce Rust's Ownership and Lifetime rules, and present the state-of-the-art in academic research into their usability. I discuss both theoretical arguments and empirical evidence for why these rules are difficult to learn and apply, and survey existing work on addressing some of these difficulties. I also draw from broader works in the HCI and CS Education communities to recommend future work in this area."

While this policy helps reduce reviewer workload, it may unintentionally discard valuable papers and penalize authors' efforts. In this paper, we ask an essential research question on whether it is possible to follow submission limits while minimizing needless rejections. We first formalize the current desk-rejection policies as an optimization problem, and then develop a practical algorithm based on linear programming relaxation and a rounding scheme. Under extensive evaluation on 11 years of real-world ICLR (International Conference on Learning Representations) data, our method preserves up to more papers without violating any author limits. Moreover, our algorithm is highly efficient in practice, with all results on ICLR data computed within at most 53.64 seconds. Our work provides a simple and practical desk-rejection strategy that significantly reduces unnecessary rejections, demonstrating strong potential to improve current CS conference submission policies."

Traditional CS reconstruction algorithms have a complete theoretical foundation but suffer from the high computational complexity, while fashionable deep network-based methods can achieve high-accuracy reconstruction of CS but are short of interpretability. These facts motivate us to develop a deep unfolding network named the penalty-based independent parameters optimization network (PIPO-Net) to combine the merits of the above mentioned two kinds of CS methods. Each module of PIPO-Net can be viewed separately as an optimization problem with respective penalty function. The main characteristic of PIPO-Net is that, in each round of training, the learnable parameters in one module are updated independently from those of other modules. This makes the network more flexible to find the optimal solutions of the corresponding problems. Moreover, the mean-subtraction sampling and the high-frequency complementary blocks are developed to improve the performance of PIPO-Net. Experiments on reconstructing CS images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PIPO-Net."

More specifically, we establis a tight connection between CS-LPD based on a zero-one measurement matrix over the reals and CC-LPD of the binary linear channel code that is obtained by viewing this measurement matrix as a binary parity-check matrix. This connection allows the translation of performance guarantees from one setup to the other. The main message of this paper is that parity-check matrices of \"good\" channel codes can be used as provably \"good\" measurement matrices under basis pursuit. In particular, we provide the first deterministic construction of compressed sensing measurement matrices with an order-optimal number of rows using high-girth low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes constructed by Gallager."

    "summary": "Deep learning methods for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) have advanced significantly, largely driven by large-scale datasets. However, most existing approaches are trained on a single dataset, which can introduce dataset-specific inductive biases and limit model generalization. While multi-dataset joint training offers a promising solution for developing universal VPR models, divergences among training datasets can saturate limited information capacity in feature aggregation layers, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose Query-based Adaptive Aggregation (QAA), a novel feature aggregation technique that leverages learned queries as reference codebooks to effectively enhance information capacity without significant computational or parameter complexity. We show that computing the Cross-query Similarity (CS) between query-level image features and reference codebooks provides a simple yet effective way to generate robust descriptors. Our results demonstrate that QAA outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving balanced generalization across diverse datasets while maintaining peak performance comparable to dataset-specific models. Ablation studies further explore QAA's mechanisms and scalability. Visualizations reveal that the learned queries exhibit diverse attention patterns across datasets. Code will be publicly released."

Expert knowledge and qualitative insights, such as those obtained through interviews, ethnographic research, historical accounts, or participatory workshops, are critical in constructing realistic behavioral rules, interactions, and decision-making processes within these models. However, there is a lack of systematic approaches that are able to incorporate both qualitative and quantitative data across the entire modeling cycle. To address this, we propose FREIDA (FRamework for Expert-Informed Data-driven Agent-based models), a systematic mixed-methods framework to develop, train, and validate ABMs, particularly in data-sparse contexts. Our main technical innovation is to extract what we call Expected System Behaviors (ESBs) from qualitative data, which are testable statements that can be evaluated on model simulations. Divided into Calibration Statements (CS) for model calibration and Validation Statements (VS) for model validation, they provide a quantitative scoring mechanism on the same footing as quantitative data. In this way, qualitative insights can inform not only model specification but also its parameterization and assessment of fitness for purpose, which is a long standing challenge. We illustrate the application of FREIDA through a case study of criminal cocaine networks in the Netherlands."

    "summary": "The circumstellar (CS) environment is key to understanding progenitors of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), as well as the origin of a peculiar extinction property toward SNe Ia for cosmological application. It has been suggested that multiple scatterings of SN photons by CS dust may explain the non-standard reddening law. In this paper, we examine the effect of re-emission of SN photons by CS dust in the infrared (IR) wavelength regime. This effect allows the observed IR light curves to be used as a constraint on the position/size and the amount of CS dust. The method was applied to observed near-infrared (NIR) SN Ia samples; meaningful upper limits on the CS dust mass were derived even under conservative assumptions. We thereby clarify a difficulty associated with the CS dust scattering model as a general explanation for the peculiar reddening law, while it may still apply to a sub-sample of highly reddened SNe Ia. For SNe Ia in general, the environment at the interstellar scale appears to be responsible for the non-standard extinction law. Furthermore, deeper limits can be obtained using the standard nature of SN Ia NIR light curves. In this application, an upper limit of Mdot ~10^ -8 -10^ -7 Msun/yr (for the wind velocity of ~10 km/s) is obtained for a mass loss rate from a progenitor up to ~0.01 pc, and Mdot ~10^ -7 -10^ -6 Msun/yr up to ~0.1 pc."

Consequently, the design of optimal sampling patterns for these k-space coefficients has received significant attention, with many CS MRI methods exploiting variable-density probability distributions. Realizing that an optimal sampling pattern may depend on the downstream task (e.g. image reconstruction, segmentation, or classification), we here propose joint learning of both task-adaptive k-space sampling and a subsequent model-based proximal-gradient recovery network. The former is enabled through a probabilistic generative model that leverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation to sample across trainable beliefs while maintaining differentiability. The proposed combination of a highly flexible sampling model and a model-based (sampling-adaptive) image reconstruction network facilitates exploration and efficient training, yielding improved MR image quality compared to other sampling baselines."

The complexity and heterogeneity of the disorder necessitate prompt and effective detection, which nonetheless, poses a difficult challenge. This situation highlights an urgent requirement for improved detection methods. Exploiting auditory data through advanced machine learning paradigms presents promising research directions. Yet, existing techniques mainly rely on single-dimensional feature models, potentially neglecting the abundance of information hidden in various speech characteristics. To rectify this, we present the novel Attention-Based Acoustic Feature Fusion Network (ABAFnet) for depression detection. ABAFnet combines four different acoustic features into a comprehensive deep learning model, thereby effectively integrating and blending multi-tiered features. We present a novel weight adjustment module for late fusion that boosts performance by efficaciously synthesizing these features. The effectiveness of our approach is confirmed via extensive validation on two clinical speech databases, CNRAC and CS-NRAC, thereby outperforming previous methods in depression detection and subtype classification. Further in-depth analysis confirms the key role of each feature and highlights the importance of MFCCrelated features in speech-based depression detection."

    "summary": "In coding theory, codes are usually designed with a certain level of randomness to facilitate analysis and accommodate different channel conditions. However, the resulting random code constructed can be suboptimal in practical implementations. Represented by a bipartite graph, the Batched Sparse Code (BATS Code) is a randomly constructed erasure code that utilizes network coding to achieve near-optimal performance in wireless multi-hop networks. In the performance analysis in the previous research, it is implicitly assumed that the coded batches in the BATS code are independent. This assumption holds only asymptotically when the number of input symbols is infinite, but it does not generally hold in a practical setting where the number of input symbols is finite, especially when the code is constructed randomly. We show that dependence among the batches significantly degrades the code's performance. In order to control the batch dependence through graphical design, we propose constructing the BATS code in a structured manner. A hardware-friendly structured BATS code called the Cyclic-Shift BATS (CS-BATS) code is proposed, which constructs the code from a small base graph using light-weight cyclic-shift operations. We demonstrate that when the base graph is properly designed, a higher decoding rate and a smaller complexity can be achieved compared with the random BATS code."

The data revealed an excess emission in its early light curve, allowing to place interesting constraints on its progenitor system (Dimitriadis et al. 2018, Shappee et al. 2018b). Here, we present extensive optical, ultraviolet, and near-infrared photometry, as well as dense sampling of optical spectra, for this object. SN 2018oh is relatively normal in its photometric evolution, with a rise time of 18.3 0.3 days and m 0.03 mag, but it seems to have bluer colors. We construct the \"uvoir\" bolometric light curve having peak luminosity as 1.49 10 erg s , from which we derive a nickel mass as 0.55 0.04M by fitting radiation diffusion models powered by centrally located Ni. Note that the moment when nickel-powered luminosity starts to emerge is +3.85 days after the first light in the Kepler data, suggesting other origins of the early-time emission, e.g., mixing of Ni to outer layers of the ejecta or interaction between the ejecta and nearby circumstellar material or a non-degenerate companion star. The spectral evolution of SN 2018oh is similar to that of a normal SN Ia, but is characterized by prominent and persistent carbon absorption features. The C II features can be detected from the early phases to about 3 weeks after the maximum light, representing the latest detection of carbon ever recorded in a SN Ia. This indicates that a considerable amount of unburned carbon exists in the ejecta of SN 2018oh and may mix into deeper layers."

The hardware complexity of an MC system employing orthogonal molecule-receptor pairs would linearly scale with the number of signaling molecule types (i.e., ). Natural olfaction systems avoid such high complexity by employing arrays of cross-reactive receptors, where each type of molecule activates multiple types of receptors and each type of receptor is predominantly activated by multiple types of molecules albeit with different activation strengths. For instance, the human olfactory system is believed to discriminate several thousands of chemicals using only a few hundred receptor types, i.e., . Motivated by this observation, we first develop an end-to-end MC channel model that accounts for the key properties of olfaction. Subsequently, we formulate the molecule mixture recovery as a convex compressive sensing (CS) problem which can be efficiently solved via available numerical solvers. Our simulation results confirm the efficiency of the proposed CS problem for the recovery of the molecular mixture signal and quantify the system performance for various system parameters."

    "title": "Adjusting Dynamics of Hopfield Neural Network via Time-variant Stimulus",
    "summary": "As a paradigmatic model for nonlinear dynamics studies, the Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) demonstrates a high susceptibility to external disturbances owing to its intricate structure. This paper delves into the challenge of modulating HNN dynamics through time-variant stimuli. The effects of adjustments using two distinct types of time-variant stimuli, namely the Weight Matrix Stimulus (WMS) and the State Variable Stimulus (SVS), along with a Constant Stimulus (CS) are reported. The findings reveal that deploying four WMSs enables the HNN to generate either a four-scroll or a coexisting two-scroll attractor. When combined with one SVS, four WMSs can lead to the formation of an eight-scroll or four-scroll attractor, while the integration of four WMSs and multiple SVSs can induce grid-multi-scroll attractors. Moreover, the introduction of a CS and an SVS can significantly disrupt the dynamic behavior of the HNN. Consequently, suitable adjustment methods are crucial for enhancing the network's dynamics, whereas inappropriate applications can lead to the loss of its chaotic characteristics. To empirically validate these enhancement effects, the study employs an FPGA hardware platform. Subsequently, an image encryption scheme is designed to demonstrate the practical application benefits of the dynamically adjusted HNN in secure multimedia communication. This exploration into the dynamic modulation of HNN via time-variant stimuli offers insightful contributions to the advancement of secure communication technologies."

    "title": "Optimal Arrays for Compressed Sensing in Snapshot-Mode Radio Interferometry",
    "summary": "Radio interferometry has always faced the problem of incomplete sampling of the Fourier plane. A possible remedy can be found in the promising new theory of compressed sensing (CS), which allows for the accurate recovery of sparse signals from sub-Nyquist sampling given certain measurement conditions. We provide an introductory assessment of optimal arrays for CS in snapshot-mode radio interferometry, using orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), a widely used CS recovery algorithm similar in some respects to CLEAN. We focus on centrally condensed (specifically, Gaussian) arrays versus uniform arrays, and the principle of randomization versus deterministic arrays such as the VLA. The theory of CS is grounded in sparse representation of signals and measurement matrices of low coherence. We calculate a related quantity, mutual coherence (MC), as a theoretical indicator of arrays' suitability for OMP based on the recovery error bounds in (Donoho et al. 2006). OMP reconstructions of both point and extended objects are also run from simulated incomplete data. Optimal arrays are considered for object recovery through 1) the natural pixel representation and 2) the representation by the block discrete cosine transform (BDCT). We find that reconstructions of the pixel representation perform best with the uniform random array, while reconstructions of the BDCT representation perform best with normal random arrays. Slight randomization to the VLA also improves it hugely for CS with the pixel basis. In the pixel basis, array design for CS reflects known principles of array design for small numbers of antennas, namely of randomness and uniform distribution. Differing results with the BDCT, however, emphasize the importance of studying how sparsifying bases affect array design before CS can be optimized."

The extended ElectrodeNet-CS strategy further incorporates the channel selection (CS). Network models of deep neural network (DNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) were trained using the Fast Fourier Transformed bins and channel envelopes obtained from the processing of clean speech by the ACE strategy. Objective speech understanding using short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) and normalized covariance metric (NCM) was estimated for ElectrodeNet using CI simulations. Sentence recognition tests for vocoded Mandarin speech were conducted with normal-hearing listeners. DNN, CNN, and LSTM based ElectrodeNets exhibited strong correlations to ACE in objective and subjective scores using mean squared error (MSE), linear correlation coefficient (LCC) and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC). The ElectrodeNet-CS strategy was capable of producing N-of-M compatible electrode patterns using a modified DNN network to embed maxima selection, and to perform in similar or even slightly higher average in STOI and sentence recognition compared to ACE. The methods and findings demonstrated the feasibility and potential of using deep learning in CI coding strategy."

The wealth of CV data provides new opportunities to improve the safety, mobility, and sustainability of transportation systems. However, the potential data explosion likely will overburden storage and communication systems. To solve this issue, we design a real-time compressive sensing (CS) approach which allows CVs to collect and compress data in real-time and can recover the original data accurately and efficiently when it is necessary. The CS approach is applied to recapture 10 million CV Basic Safety Message speed samples from the Safety Pilot Model Deployment program. With a compression ratio of 0.2, it is found that the CS approach can recover the original speed data with the root mean squared error as low as 0.05. The recovery performances of the CS approach are further explored by time-of-day and acceleration. The results show that the CS approach performs better in data recovery when CV speeds are steady or changing smoothly."

    "summary": "Fast and scalable alignment of time series is a fundamental challenge in many domains. The standard solution, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), struggles with poor scalability and sensitivity to noise. We introduce TimePoint, a self-supervised method that dramatically accelerates DTW-based alignment while typically improving alignment accuracy by learning keypoints and descriptors from synthetic data. Inspired by 2D keypoint detection but carefully adapted to the unique challenges of 1D signals, TimePoint leverages efficient 1D diffeomorphisms, which effectively model nonlinear time warping, to generate realistic training data. This approach, along with fully convolutional and wavelet convolutional architectures, enables the extraction of informative keypoints and descriptors. Applying DTW to these sparse representations yield major speedups and typically higher alignment accuracy than standard DTW applied to the full signals. TimePoint demonstrates strong generalization to real-world time series when trained solely on synthetic data, and further improves with fine-tuning on real data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimePoint consistently achieves faster and more accurate alignments than standard DTW, making it a scalable solution for time-series analysis.

When such a framework is implemented in small-cell IoT (Internet of Tings) networks, it is a key and open topic how to assign mobile edge computing and caching servers to mobile devices (MDs) with CS and HR communications. Since these servers are integrated into small base stations (BSs), the assignment of them refers to not only the BS selection (i.e., MD association), but also the selection of computing and caching modes. To mitigate the network interference and thus enhance the system performance, some highly-effective resource partitioning mechanisms are introduced for access and backhaul links firstly. After that a problem with minimizing the sum of MDs' weighted delays is formulated to attain a goal of joint MD association and resource allocation under limited resources. Considering that the MD association and resource allocation parameters are coupling in such a formulated problem, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm according to the coalitional game and convex optimization theorems. To ensure that the designed algorithm begins from a feasible initial solution, we develop an initiation algorithm according to the conventional best channel association, which is used for comparison and the input of coalition game in the simulation. Simulation results show that the algorithm designed for minimizing the sum of MDs' weighted delays may achieve a better performance than the initiation (best channel association) algorithm in general."

    "summary": "Many astronomical objects are surrounded by dusty environments. In such dusty objects, multiple scattering processes of photons by circumstellar (CS) dust grains can effectively alter extinction properties. In this paper, we systematically investigate effects of multiple scattering on extinction laws for steady-emission sources surrounded by the dusty CS medium, using a radiation transfer simulation based on the Monte Carlo technique. In particular, we focus on whether and how the extinction properties are affected by properties of CS dust grains, adopting various dust grain models. We confirm that behaviors of the (effective) extinction laws are highly dependent on the properties of CS grains. Especially, the total-to-selective extinction ratio , which characterizes the extinction law, can be either increased or decreased, compared to the case without multiple scattering. We find that the criterion for this behavior is given by a ratio of albedos in the and bands. We also find that either small silicate grains or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are necessary for realizing a low value of as often measured toward Type Ia supernovae, if the multiple scattering by CS dust is responsible for their non-standard extinction laws. Using the derived relations between the properties of dust grains and the resulting effective extinction laws, we propose that the extinction laws toward dusty objects could be used to constrain the properties of dust grains in CS environments."

These spin-flip transitions of Rb and Cs are the principal transitions used in atomic clocks (the Cs hyperfine transition defines the second). If they are detected in stellar atmospheres, these transitions would provide exceptionally precise clocks that can be used as accelerometers, as exoplanet detectors, as probes of the predictions of general relativity, as probes of light propagation effects, and as a means to do fundamental physics with telescopes. Observations of 21 M- and L-dwarfs, however, show no evidence for Rb or Cs maser action, and a previous survey of giant stars made no Rb maser detections."

However, the hypothesis specifically concerns computers that simulate physical universes. So to formally investigate the hypothesis, we need to understand it in terms of computer science (CS) theory. In addition we need a formal way to couple CS theory with physics. Here I couple those fields by using the physical Church-Turing thesis. This allow me to exploit Kleene's second recursion, to prove that not only is it possible for us to be a simulation being run on a computer, but that we might be in a simulation being run a computer by us . In such a ``self-simulation'', there would be two identical instances of us, both equally ``real''. I then use Rice's theorem to derive impossibility results concerning simulation and self-simulation; derive implications for (self-)simulation if we are being simulated in a program using fully homomorphic encryption; and briefly investigate the graphical structure of universes simulating other universes which contain computers running their own simulations. I end by describing some of the possible avenues for future research. While motivated in terms of the simulation hypothesis, the results in this paper are direct consequences of the Church-Turing thesis. So they apply far more broadly than the simulation hypothesis."

    "summary": "The dynamics of charged particles in general linear focusing lattices with quadrupole, skew-quadrupole, dipole, and solenoidal components, as well as torsion of the fiducial orbit and variation of beam energy is parameterized using a generalized Courant-Snyder (CS) theory, which extends the original CS theory for one degree of freedom to higher dimensions. The envelope function is generalized into an envelope matrix, and the phase advance is generalized into a 4D symplectic rotation, or an U(2) element. The 1D envelope equation, also known as the Ermakov-Milne-Pinney equation in quantum mechanics, is generalized to an envelope matrix equation in higher dimensions. Other components of the original CS theory, such as the transfer matrix, Twiss functions, and CS invariant (also known as the Lewis invariant) all have their counterparts, with remarkably similar expressions, in the generalized theory. The gauge group structure of the generalized theory is analyzed. By fixing the gauge freedom with a desired symmetry, the generalized CS parameterization assumes the form of the modified Iwasawa decomposition, whose importance in phase space optics and phase space quantum mechanics has been recently realized. This gauge fixing also symmetrizes the generalized envelope equation and express the theory using only the generalized Twiss function β.The generalized phase advance completely determines the spectral and structural stability properties of a general focusing lattice. For structural stability, the generalized CS theory enables application of the Krein-Moser theory to greatly simplify the stability analysis. The generalized CS theory provides an effective tool to study coupled dynamics and to discover more optimized lattice design in the larger parameter space of general focusing lattices."

The method drastically improves convergence speed compared to similar Monte Carlo based approaches. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that it outperforms compressive sensing algorithms such as IHT and (Relaxed-) Lasso across a wide range of settings and signal-to-noise ratios. The implementation runs efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs and is freely available at https://github.com/L0-and-behold/probabilistic-nonlinear-cs. We also contribute to research on nonlinear generalizations of compressive sensing by investigating when parameter recovery of a nonlinear teacher network is possible through compression of a student network. Building upon theorems of Fefferman and Markel, we show theoretically that the global optimum in the infinite-data limit enforces recovery up to certain symmetries. For empirical validation, we implement a normal-form algorithm that selects a canonical representative within each symmetry class. However, while compression can help to improve test loss, we find that exact parameter recovery is not even possible up to symmetries. In particular, we observe a surprising rebound effect where teacher and student configurations initially converge but subsequently diverge despite continuous decrease in test loss. These findings indicate fundamental differences between linear and nonlinear compressive sensing."

Here, we employ CS to generate a set of 2103 fault ruptures and simulate the corresponding two horizontal velocity components time histories of ground motion (GM) on a 5-km grid of 625 stations in Southwest Iceland (SI). The ruptures were defined on a new synthetic time-independent 500-year catalog consisting of 223 hypothetical finite-fault sources of 5-7, generated using a new physics-based bookshelf fault system model in the SI transform zone. This fault system model and rupture realizations enable the CS time-independent physics-based approach to PSHA in the region. The study aims to migrate CS to SI and validate its kinematic fault rupture, anelastic wave propagation and ground motion simulations. Toward this goal, we use CS to generate multiple finite-fault rupture variations for each hypothetical fault. CS exploits seismic reciprocity for wave propagation by computing Strain Green Tensors along fault planes, which in turn are convolved with rupture models to generate GM seismograms. For each GM recording station, every adjoint simulation uses a 0-1 Hz Gaussian point source polarized along one horizontal grid direction. Comparison of the results in the form of rotation-invariant synthetic pseudo-acceleration spectral response values at 2, 3 and 5 sec periods are in very good agreement with the Icelandic strong-motion dataset, and a suite of new empirical Bayesian ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs). The vast majority of the CS results fall within one standard deviation of the mean GMPE predictions, previously estimated for the area. Importantly, at large magnitudes for which no data exists in Iceland, the CS dataset may play an important role in constraining the GMPEs for future applications."

Furthermore, Transformers do not generalize well on small medical imaging datasets and rely on large-scale pre-training due to limited inductive biases. To address these problems, we demonstrate the design of a compact and accurate Transformer network for MISS, CS-Unet, which introduces convolutions in a multi-stage design for hierarchically enhancing spatial and local modeling ability of Transformers. This is mainly achieved by our well-designed Convolutional Swin Transformer (CST) block which merges convolutions with Multi-Head Self-Attention and Feed-Forward Networks for providing inherent localized spatial context and inductive biases.

Remarkably, CsMPs 0.58-2.0 micrometer in size constituted 80%-89% of the total Cs radioactivity during the initial fallout events on 15th March, 2011. The CsMPs from Tokyo and Fukushima exhibit the same texture at the nanoscale: aggregates of Zn-Fe-oxide nanoparticles embedded in amorphous SiO2 glass. The Cs is associated with Zn-Fe-oxide nanoparticles or in the form of nanoscale inclusions of intrinsic Cs species,rather than dissolved in the SiO2 matrix. The Cs concentration in CsMPs from Tokyo (0.55-10.9 wt%) is generally less than that in particles from Fukushima (8.5-12.9 wt%).The radioactivity per unit mass of CsMPs from Tokyo is still as high as 1E11 Bq/g, which is extremely high for particles originating from nuclear accidents. Thus, inhalation of the low-solubility CsMPs would result in a high localized energy deposition by beta (0.51-12)*1E-3 Gy/h within the 100-micrometer-thick water layer on the CsMP surface) and may have longer-term effects compared with those predicted for soluble Cs-species."

The CO emission reveals clearly a bipolar molecular outflow centered on the dense clump. The CS emission traces a ring-like structure of radius ~0.24 pc. The CS kinematics shows that the ring is collapsing with an infall speed of ~0.6 km/s. The required mass to produce the collapse is in agreement with previous ammonia observations of the 20 solar mass core, which is embedded within the CS structure. However, we cannot discard that the ring structure is expanding driven by protostellar winds, if the CS abundance if unusually high and the CO momentum rate is much higher than that measured, due to inclination and optical depth effects. The properties of the molecular outflow and of the dense core suggest that it harbors a Class 0 object. There are also signatures of interaction of the HH 80/81/80N outflow with the dense gas. In particular it is possible that the HH 80/81/80N outflow has triggered or at least speed up the star formation in this region."

Within these systems, comprising a line-of-sight (LoS) channel component alongside far-field and near-field scattering channel components, our objective is to tackle the channel estimation challenge. We encounter two central hurdles for ensuring dependable sparse channel recovery: the design of pilot signals and channel estimators tailored for hybrid-field communications. To overcome the first challenge, we propose a method to derive optimal pilot signals, aimed at minimizing the mutual coherence of the sensing matrix within the context of compressive sensing (CS) problems. These optimal signals are derived using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), ensuring robust performance in sparse channel recovery. Additionally, leveraging the acquired optimal pilot signal, we introduce a two-stage channel estimation approach that sequentially estimates the LoS channel component and the hybrid-field scattering channel components. Simulation results attest to the superiority of our co-designed approach for pilot signal and channel estimation over conventional CS-based methods, providing more reliable sparse channel recovery in practical scenarios."

When using answer set programming in such contexts, one can avoid the iterative generation of ground programs thus achieving a significant payoff in terms of computing time. However, this may require some additional amount of memory and/or the manual addition of operational directives in the declarative knowledge base at hand. We introduce a new strategy for generating series of monotonically growing propositional programs. The proposed overgrounded programs with tailoring (OPTs) can be updated and reused in combination with consecutive inputs. With respect to earlier approaches, our tailored simplification technique reduces the size of instantiated programs. A maintained OPT slowly grows in size from an iteration to another while the update cost decreases, especially in later iterations. In this paper we formally introduce tailored embeddings, a family of equivalence-preserving ground programs which are at the theoretical basis of OPTs and we describe their properties. We then illustrate an OPT update algorithm and report about our implementation and its performance. This paper is under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)."

The dissipation timescales of CS disks are, therefore, of direct astrophysical importance in evaluating the time available for planet formation. We employ Spitzer Space Telescope spectra to complete the CS disk census for the late-type members of the ~8 Myr-old eta Chamaeleontis star cluster. Of the 15 K- and M-type members, eight show excess emission. We find that the presence of a CS disk is anti-correlated with binarity, with all but one disk associated with single stars. With nine single stars in total, about 80% retain a CS disk. Of the six known or suspected close binaries the only CS disk is associated with the primary of RECX 9. No circumbinary disks have been detected. We also find that stars with disks are slow rotators with surface values of specific angular momentum j = 2-15 j_sun. All high specific angular momentum systems with j = 20-30 j_sun are confined to the primary stars of binaries. This provides novel empirical evidence for rotational disk locking and again demonstrates the much shorter disk lifetimes in close binary systems compared to single star systems. We estimate the characteristic mean disk dissipation timescale to be ~5 Myr and ~9 Myr for the binary and single star systems, respectively."

To accelerate DSI and HARDI, recent methods from compressed sensing (CS) exploit a sparse underlying representation of the data in the spatial and angular domains to undersample in the respective k- and q-spaces. State-of-the-art frameworks, however, impose sparsity in the spatial and angular domains separately and involve the sum of the corresponding sparse regularizers. In contrast, we propose a unified (k,q)-CS formulation which imposes sparsity jointly in the spatial-angular domain to further increase sparsity of dMRI signals and reduce the required subsampling rate. To efficiently solve this large-scale global reconstruction problem, we introduce a novel adaptation of the FISTA algorithm that exploits dictionary separability. We show on phantom and real HARDI data that our approach achieves significantly more accurate signal reconstructions than the state of the art while sampling only 2-4% of the (k,q)-space, allowing for the potential of new levels of dMRI acceleration."

    "summary": "The foundation models based on pre-training technology have significantly advanced artificial intelligence from theoretical to practical applications. These models have facilitated the feasibility of computer-aided diagnosis for widespread use. Medical contrastive vision-language pre-training, which does not require human annotations, is an effective approach for guiding representation learning using description information in diagnostic reports. However, the effectiveness of pre-training is limited by the large-scale semantic overlap and shifting problems in medical field. To address these issues, we propose the Knowledge-Boosting Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-training framework (KoBo), which integrates clinical knowledge into the learning of vision-language semantic consistency. The framework uses an unbiased, open-set sample-wise knowledge representation to measure negative sample noise and supplement the correspondence between vision-language mutual information and clinical knowledge. Extensive experiments validate the effect of our framework on eight tasks including classification, segmentation, retrieval, and semantic relatedness, achieving comparable or better performance with the zero-shot or few-shot settings. Our code is open on https://github.com/ChenXiaoFei-CS/KoBo."

    "title": "Four-Dimensional Chern-Simons and Gauged Sigma Models",
    "summary": "In this paper, we introduce a new method for constructing gauged -models from four-dimensional Chern-Simons (4d CS) gauge theory. We begin with a review of recent work by several authors on the classical generation of integrable -models from 4d CS. In this approach, a gauge field is required to satisfy certain boundary conditions on two-dimensional defects inserted into the bulk. Using these boundary conditions, the equations of motion are solved, and the result is substituted back into the action. This yields a -model whose integrability is guaranteed because the 4d CS field is gauge equivalent to a Lax connection. Using a theory consisting of two 4d CS fields coupled together on new classes of ``gauged'' defects, we construct gauged -models and identify a unifying action. These models are conjectured to be integrable because the 4d CS fields remain gauge equivalent to two Lax connections. Finally, we consider two examples: the gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model and the nilpotent gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten models. This latter model is of note as one can find the conformal Toda models from it."

    "summary": "We study compute efficiency of LLM training when using different parameterizations, i.e., rules for adjusting model and optimizer hyperparameters (HPs) as model size changes. Some parameterizations fail to transfer optimal base HPs (such as learning rate) across changes in model depth, requiring practitioners to either re-tune these HPs as they scale up (expensive), or accept sub-optimal training when re-tuning is prohibitive. Even when they achieve HP transfer, we develop theory to show parameterizations may still exist in the lazy learning regime where layers learn only features close to their linearization, preventing effective use of depth and nonlinearity. Finally, we identify and adopt the parameterization we call CompleteP that achieves both depth-wise HP transfer and non-lazy learning in all layers. CompleteP enables a wider range of model width/depth ratios to remain compute-efficient, unlocking shapes better suited for different hardware settings and operational contexts. Moreover, CompleteP enables 12-34% compute efficiency improvements over the prior state-of-the-art. All experiments were run on Cerebras CS-3 systems. A minimal implementation is available at https://github.com/EleutherAI/nanoGPT-mup/tree/completep."

We consider a general version of MAPF, called mMAPF, that involves multi-modal transportation modes (e.g., due to velocity constraints) and consumption of different types of resources (e.g., batteries). The real-world applications of mMAPF require flexibility (e.g., solving variations of mMAPF) as well as explainability. Our earlier studies on mMAPF have focused on the former challenge of flexibility. In this study, we focus on the latter challenge of explainability, and introduce a method for generating explanations for queries regarding the feasibility and optimality of solutions, the nonexistence of solutions, and the observations about solutions. Our method is based on answer set programming. This paper is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP."

    "summary": "In the past decade, sparse and low-rank recovery have drawn much attention in many areas such as signal/image processing, statistics, bioinformatics and machine learning. To achieve sparsity and/or low-rankness inducing, the norm and nuclear norm are of the most popular regularization penalties due to their convexity. While the and nuclear norm are convenient as the related convex optimization problems are usually tractable, it has been shown in many applications that a nonconvex penalty can yield significantly better performance. In recent, nonconvex regularization based sparse and low-rank recovery is of considerable interest and it in fact is a main driver of the recent progress in nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization. This paper gives an overview of this topic in various fields in signal processing, statistics and machine learning, including compressive sensing (CS), sparse regression and variable selection, sparse signals separation, sparse principal component analysis (PCA), large covariance and inverse covariance matrices estimation, matrix completion, and robust PCA. We present recent developments of nonconvex regularization based sparse and low-rank recovery in these fields, addressing the issues of penalty selection, applications and the convergence of nonconvex algorithms.

    "title": "Efficient Computation of Confidence Sets Using Classification on Equidistributed Grids",
    "summary": "Economic models produce moment inequalities, which can be used to form tests of the true parameters. Confidence sets (CS) of the true parameters are derived by inverting these tests. However, they often lack analytical expressions, necessitating a grid search to obtain the CS numerically by retaining the grid points that pass the test. When the statistic is not asymptotically pivotal, constructing the critical value for each grid point in the parameter space adds to the computational burden. In this paper, we convert the computational issue into a classification problem by using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Its decision function provides a faster and more systematic way of dividing the parameter space into two regions: inside vs. outside of the confidence set. We label those points in the CS as 1 and those outside as -1. Researchers can train the SVM classifier on a grid of manageable size and use it to determine whether points on denser grids are in the CS or not. We establish certain conditions for the grid so that there is a tuning that allows us to asymptotically reproduce the test in the CS. This means that in the limit, a point is classified as belonging to the confidence set if and only if it is labeled as 1 by the SVM."

The relation between both theories mimics the well-known CS/WZW symplectic reduction equivalence but is non-chiral in nature. All the statements are now valid in the strong sense, i.e. valid on the whole phase space, making the connection between both theories precise. By constructing a -dependent gauge field in the 2+1 Hamiltonian CS theory it is shown that: i) by performing a symplectic reduction of the CS theory the Maillet algebra satisfied by the extended Lax connection of the lambda model emerges as a boundary current algebra and ii) the Poisson algebra of the supertraces of -dependent Wilson loops in the CS theory obey some sort of spectral parameter generalization of the Goldman bracket. The latter algebra is interpreted as the precursor of the (ambiguous) lambda model monodromy matrix Poisson algebra prior to the symplectic reduction. As a consequence, the problematic non-ultralocality of lambda models is avoided (for any value of the deformation parameter ), showing how the lambda model classical integrable structure can be understood as a byproduct of the symplectic reduction process of the -dependent CS theory."

For this setup, we investigate the performance of several relative transfer function (RTF) vector estimation methods to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of the target speaker in a noisy and reverberant acoustic environment. More in particular, we consider the state-of-the-art covariance whitening (CW) and covariance subtraction (CS) methods, either incorporating the external microphone or not, and the recently proposed spatial coherence (SC) method, requiring the external microphone. To estimate the DOA from the estimated RTF vector, we propose to minimize the frequency-averaged Hermitian angle between the estimated head-mounted RTF vector and a database of prototype head-mounted RTF vectors. Experimental results with stationary and moving speech sources in a reverberant environment with diffuse-like noise show that the SC method outperforms the CS method and yields a similar DOA estimation accuracy as the CW method at a lower computational complexity."

To accomplish this work, the hidden Virasoro structure in the CS model is much explored. In particular, we found that the Virasoro singular vectors form a skew hierarchy in the CS model. Literally, skew is analogous to coset, but here specifically refer to the operation on the Young tableaux. In fact, based on the construction of the Virasoro singular vectors, this hierarchical structure can be used to give a complete construction of the CS states, i.e. the Jack symmetric functions, recursively. The construction is given both in operator formalism as well as in integral representation. This new integral representation for the Jack symmetric functions may shed some insights on the spectrum constructions for the other integrable systems."

In this publication, a novel depletion mode JFET based complementary circuit technology is presented and herein after referred to as Complementary Semiconductor (CS) circuit technology. The fact that JFETs are pure semiconductor devices, i.e. a carefully optimized Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) gate stack is not required, facilitates the implementation of CS circuit technology to many semiconductor materials, like e.g. germanium and silicon carbide. Furthermore, when the CS circuit technology is idle there are neither conductive paths between nodes that are biased at different potentials nor forward biased p-n junctions and thus it enables low static power consumption. Moreover, the fact that the operation of depletion mode JFETs does not necessitate the incorporation of forward biased p-n junctions means that CS circuit technology is not limited to wide band-gap semiconductor materials, low temperatures, and/or low voltage spans. In this paper the operation of the CS logic is described and proven via simulations."

By taking advantage of deep learning in accelerating optimization algorithms, together with the speedup strategy that using the momentum from all previous layers in the network, we propose a learning-based method, called QISTA-Net-s, to solve the sparse signal reconstruction problem. Extensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that the QISTA-Net-s yield better reconstruction qualities than state-of-the-art -norm optimization (plus learning) algorithms even if the original sparse signal is noisy. On the other hand, based on the network architecture associated with QISTA, with considering the use of convolution layers, we proposed the QISTA-Net-n for solving the image CS problem, and the performance of the reconstruction still outperforms most of the state-of-the-art natural images reconstruction methods. QISTA-Net-n is designed in unfolding QISTA and adding the convolutional operator as the dictionary. This makes QISTA-Net-s interpretable. We provide complete experimental results that QISTA-Net-s and QISTA-Net-n contribute the better reconstruction performance than the competing."

Results from compressed sensing (CS) establish such conditions for, e.g., random measurements, but not for CT. Recoverability is typically tested by checking whether a computed solution recovers the original. This approach cannot guarantee solution uniqueness and the recoverability decision therefore depends on the optimization algorithm. We propose new computational methods to test recoverability by verifying solution uniqueness conditions. Using both reconstruction and uniqueness testing we empirically study the number of CT measurements sufficient for recovery on new classes of sparse test images. We demonstrate an average-case relation between sparsity and sufficient sampling and observe a sharp phase transition as known from CS, but never established for CT. In addition to assessing recoverability more reliably, we show that uniqueness tests are often the faster option."

    "summary": "The growing urban complexity demands an efficient algorithm to acquire and process various sensor information from autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm to utilize object detection results from the image to adaptively sample and acquire radar data using Compressed Sensing (CS). This novel algorithm is motivated by the hypothesis that with a limited sampling budget, allocating more sampling budget to areas with the object as opposed to a uniform sampling ultimately improves relevant object detection performance. We improve detection performance by dynamically allocating a lower sampling rate to objects such as buses than pedestrians leading to better reconstruction than baseline across areas with objects of interest. We automate the sampling rate allocation using linear programming and show significant time savings while reducing the radar block size by a factor of 2. We also analyze a Binary Permuted Diagonal measurement matrix for radar acquisition which is hardware-efficient and show its performance is similar to Gaussian and Binary Permuted Block Diagonal matrix. Our experiments on the Oxford radar dataset show an effective reconstruction of objects of interest with 10% sampling rate. Finally, we develop a transformer-based 2D object detection network using the NuScenes radar and image data."

    "title": "Sigma Delta quantization with Harmonic frames and partial Fourier ensembles",
    "summary": "Sigma Delta quantization, a quantization method which first surfaced in the 1960s, has now been used widely in various digital products such as cameras, cell phones, radars, etc. The method samples an input signal at a rate higher than the Nyquist rate, thus achieves great robustness to quantization noise. Compressed Sensing (CS) is a frugal acquisition method that utilizes the possible sparsity of the signals to reduce the required number of samples for a lossless acquisition. One can deem the reduced number as an effective dimensionality of the set of sparse signals and accordingly, define an effective oversampling rate as the ratio between the actual sampling rate and the effective dimensionality. A natural conjecture is that the error of Sigma Delta quantization, previously shown to decay with the vanilla oversampling rate, should now decay with the effective oversampling rate when carried out in the regime of compressed sensing. Confirming this intuition is one of the main goals in this direction. The study of quantization in CS has so far been limited to proving error convergence results for Gaussian and sub-Gaussian sensing matrices, as the number of bits and/or the number of samples grow to infinity. In this paper, we provide a first result for the more realistic Fourier sensing matrices. The major idea is to randomly permute the Fourier samples before feeding them into the quantizer. We show that the random permutation can effectively increase the low frequency power of the measurements, thus enhance the quality of quantization."

Generally CS undergraduate modules are composed of 24 hours of lectures and 24 hours of labs where students learn theoretical concepts in the lectures and apply their understanding to practical lab-based exercises. The problem with this approach is that students do not gain any awareness of, or learn how to solve tasks that they are likely to encounter in a real-world industrial setting; nor do they gain experience of working as part of a team even though most software development positions involve team-based work. This paper reports on a web-based development module that incorporated a real-world group based project was re-designed and delivered. The module went well; however, assessing the work fairly was found to be difficult, especially where team members contributed at considerably varying levels was a challenge. Of particular concern was that some hard-working students were penalised by other students poor work and lazy students were rewarded because of more hard-working students work. This action research project will attempt to re-address how to assess this group-based work with a cohort of students. The goal of the research is to implement an innovative assessment structure, using peer-, self-, and co-assessment, for a group based real-world project, that is deemed fair and reasonable and provided a good learning environment."

    "title": "Coreset Selection via LLM-based Concept Bottlenecks",
    "summary": "Coreset Selection (CS) aims to identify a subset of the training dataset that achieves model performance comparable to using the entire dataset. Many state-of-the-art CS methods select coresets using scores whose computation requires training the downstream model on the entire dataset first and recording changes in the model's behavior on samples as it trains (training dynamics). These scores are inefficient to compute and hard to interpret, as they do not indicate whether a sample is difficult to learn in general or only for a specific downstream model. Our work addresses these challenges by proposing a score that computes a sample's difficulty using human-understandable textual attributes (concepts) independent of any downstream model. Specifically, we measure the alignment between a sample's visual features and concept bottlenecks, derived via large language models, by training a linear concept bottleneck layer and computing the sample's difficulty score using it.We then use stratified sampling based on this score to generate a coreset of the dataset.Crucially, our score is efficiently computable without training the downstream model on the full dataset even once, leads to high-performing coresets for various downstream models, and is computable even for an unlabeled dataset. Through experiments on CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet-1K, we show that our coresets outperform random subsets, even at high pruning rates, and achieve model performance comparable to or better than coresets found by training dynamics-based methods."

Although traditional methods, such as occupancy mapping, provide a basic framework, they often fail to account for the complex mobility capabilities of some platforms such as legged robots. In this work, we propose a method for estimating terrain traversability by learning from demonstrations of human walking. Our approach leverages dense, pixel-wise feature embeddings generated using the DINOv2 vision Transformer model, which are processed through an encoder-decoder MLP architecture to analyze terrain segments. The averaged feature vectors, extracted from the masked regions of interest, are used to train the model in a reconstruction-based framework. By minimizing reconstruction loss, the network distinguishes between familiar terrain with a low reconstruction error and unfamiliar or hazardous terrain with a higher reconstruction error. This approach facilitates the detection of anomalies, allowing a legged robot to navigate more effectively through challenging terrain. We run real-world experiments on the ANYmal legged robot both indoor and outdoor to prove our proposed method.

This study investigates an under-explored issue about the evaluation of LLMs, namely the substantial discrepancy in performance between multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions. Inspired by research on jailbreak attack patterns, we argue this is caused by mismatched generalization. That is, LLM only remembers the answer style for open-ended safety questions, which makes it unable to solve other forms of safety tests. We refer to this phenomenon as fake alignment and construct a comparative benchmark to empirically verify its existence in LLMs. We introduce a Fake alIgNment Evaluation (FINE) framework and two novel metrics--Consistency Score (CS) and Consistent Safety Score (CSS), which jointly assess two complementary forms of evaluation to quantify fake alignment and obtain corrected performance estimation. Applying FINE to 14 widely-used LLMs reveals several models with purported safety are poorly aligned in practice. Subsequently, we found that multiple-choice format data can also be used as high-quality contrast distillation-based fine-tuning data, which can strongly improve the alignment consistency of LLMs with minimal fine-tuning overhead.

Automated recommendation systems are essential for users to discover music they love and for artists to reach appropriate audience. When manual annotations and user preference data is lacking (e.g. for new artists) these systems must rely on content based methods. Besides powerful machine learning tools for classification and retrieval, a key component for successful recommendation is the audio content representation . Good representations should capture informative musical patterns in the audio signal of songs. These representations should be concise, to enable efficient (low storage, easy indexing, fast search) management of huge music repositories, and should also be easy and fast to compute, to enable real-time interaction with a user supplying new songs to the system. Before designing new audio features, we explore the usage of traditional local features, while adding a stage of encoding with a pre-computed codebook and a stage of pooling to get compact vectorial representations. We experiment with different encoding methods, namely the LASSO , vector quantization (VQ) and cosine similarity (CS) . We evaluate the representations' quality in two music information retrieval applications: query-by-tag and query-by-example. Our results show that concise representations can be used for successful performance in both applications. We recommend using top- VQ encoding, which consistently performs well in both applications, and requires much less computation time than the LASSO."

Particularly in translating complex data points composed of multiple components, it is common to translate each component separately. However, we argue that this practice often overlooks the interrelation between components within the same data point. To address this limitation, we propose a novel MT pipeline that considers the intra-data relation in implementing MT for training data. In our MT pipeline, all the components in a data point are concatenated to form a single translation sequence and subsequently reconstructed to the data components after translation. We introduce a Catalyst Statement (CS) to enhance the intra-data relation, and Indicator Token (IT) to assist the decomposition of a translated sequence into its respective data components. Through our approach, we have achieved a considerable improvement in translation quality itself, along with its effectiveness as training data. Compared with the conventional approach that translates each data component separately, our method yields better training data that enhances the performance of the trained model by 2.690 points for the web page ranking (WPR) task, and 0.845 for the question generation (QG) task in the XGLUE benchmark."

While a joint transceiver design technique at the CS's BS and users is proposed to maximise the probability of detection (PoD) of the MIMO RS, subject to constraints of quality of service (QoS) of users and transmit power at the CS, null-space based waveform projection is used to mitigate the interference from RS towards CS. In particular, the proposed technique optimises the performance of PoD of RS by maximising its lower bound, which is obtained by exploiting the monotonically increasing relationship of PoD and its non-centrality parameter. Numerical results show the utility of the proposed spectrum sharing framework, but with certain trade-offs in performance corresponding to RS's transmit power, RS's PoD, CS's residual self interference power at the FD BS and QoS of users."

We also consider the case where the resonant sonic horizon is produced by a space-dependent contact interaction. In some cases, CS violation can be observed by direct atom counting in a time-of-flight experiment. We show that near the conventional zero-frequency radiation peak, the decisive CS violation cannot occur."

    "summary": "Persistent surveillance from camera networks, such as at parking lots, UAVs, etc., often results in large amounts of video data, resulting in significant challenges for inference in terms of storage, communication and computation. Compressive cameras have emerged as a potential solution to deal with the data deluge issues in such applications. However, inference tasks such as action recognition require high quality features which implies reconstructing the original video data. Much work in compressive sensing (CS) theory is geared towards solving the reconstruction problem, where state-of-the-art methods are computationally intensive and provide low-quality results at high compression rates. Thus, reconstruction-free methods for inference are much desired. In this paper, we propose reconstruction-free methods for action recognition from compressive cameras at high compression ratios of 100 and above. Recognizing actions directly from CS measurements requires features which are mostly nonlinear and thus not easily applicable. This leads us to search for such properties that are preserved in compressive measurements. To this end, we propose the use of spatio-temporal smashed filters, which are compressive domain versions of pixel-domain matched filters. We conduct experiments on publicly available databases and show that one can obtain recognition rates that are comparable to the oracle method in uncompressed setup, even for high compression ratios."

    "summary": "Parallel acquisition systems are employed successfully in a variety of different sensing applications when a single sensor cannot provide enough measurements for a high-quality reconstruction. In this paper, we consider compressed sensing (CS) for parallel acquisition systems when the individual sensors use subgaussian random sampling. Our main results are a series of uniform recovery guarantees which relate the number of measurements required to the basis in which the solution is sparse and certain characteristics of the multi-sensor system, known as sensor profile matrices. In particular, we derive sufficient conditions for optimal recovery, in the sense that the number of measurements required per sensor decreases linearly with the total number of sensors, and demonstrate explicit examples of multi-sensor systems for which this holds. We establish these results by proving the so-called Asymmetric Restricted Isometry Property (ARIP) for the sensing system and use this to derive both nonuniversal and universal recovery guarantees. Compared to existing work, our results not only lead to better stability and robustness estimates but also provide simpler and sharper constants in the measurement conditions. Finally, we show how the problem of CS with block-diagonal sensing matrices can be viewed as a particular case of our multi-sensor framework. Specializing our results to this setting leads to a recovery guarantee that is at least as good as existing results."

Simultaneously, researchers put these newly developed safety measures to the test by assuming the role of an adversary to find vulnerabilities and backdoors in them. We use compositional property of diffusion models, which allows to leverage multiple prompts in a single image generation. This property allows us to combine other concepts, that should not have been affected by the inhibition, to reconstruct the vector, responsible for target concept generation, even though the direct computation of this vector is no longer accessible. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence why the proposed attacks are possible and discuss the implications of these findings for safe model deployment. We argue that it is essential to consider all possible approaches to image generation with diffusion models that can be employed by an adversary.

The necessary distances between camera and observed animals are traditionally derived in a laborious, fully manual or semi-automatic process. Both approaches require reference image material, which is both difficult to acquire and not available for existing datasets. We propose a fully automatic approach we call AUtomated DIstance esTimation (AUDIT) to estimate camera-to-animal distances. We leverage existing state-of-the-art relative monocular depth estimation and combine it with a novel alignment procedure to estimate metric distances. AUDIT is fully automated and requires neither the comparison of observations in camera trap imagery with reference images nor capturing of reference image material at all. AUDIT therefore relieves biologists and ecologists from a significant workload. We evaluate AUDIT on a zoo scenario dataset unseen during training where we achieve a mean absolute distance estimation error over all animal instances of only 0.9864 meters and mean relative error (REL) of 0.113.

    "title": "Complexity Synchronization in Emergent Intelligence",
    "summary": "In this work, we use a simple multi-agent-based model (MABM), implementing selfish algorithm (SA) agents, to create an adaptive environment and show, using modified diffusion entropy analysis (MDEA), that the mutual-adaptive interaction between the parts of such a network manifests complexity synchronization (CS). CS has been experimentally shown to exist among organ-networks (ONs) of the brain (neurophysiology), lungs (respiration), and heart (cardiovascular reactivity) and to be explained theoretically as a synchronization of the multifractal scaling parameters characterizing each time series. Herein, we find the same kind of CS in the emergent intelligence (i.e., without macroscopic control and based on self-interest) between two groups of agents playing an anti-coordination game, thereby suggesting the potential for the same CS in real-world social phenomena and in human-machine interactions."

    "title": "Modeling UV and X-Ray Emission in a Post-CME Current Sheet",
    "summary": "A post-CME current sheet (CS) is a common feature developed behind an erupting flux rope in CME models. Observationally, white light observations have recorded many occurrences of a thin ray appearing behind a CME eruption that closely resembles a post-CME CS in its spatial correspondence and morphology. UV and X-ray observations further strengthen this interpretation by the observations of high temperature emission at locations consistent with model predictions. The next question then becomes whether the properties inside a post-CME CS predicted by a model agree with observed properties. In this work, we assume that the post-CME CS is a consequence of Petschek-like reconnection and that the observed ray-like structure is bounded by a pair of slow mode shocks developed from the reconnection site. We perform time-dependent ionization calculations and model the UV line emission. We find that such a model is consistent with SOHO/UVCS observations of the post-CME CS. The change of Fe XVIII emission in one event implies an inflow speed of ~10 km/s and a corresponding reconnection rate of M_A ~ 0.01. We calculate the expected X-ray emission for comparison with X-ray observations by Hinode/XRT, as well as the ionic charge states as would be measured in-situ at 1 AU. We find that the predicted count rate for Hinode/XRT agree with what was observed in a post-CME CS on April 9, 2008, and the predicted ionic charge states are consistent with high ionization states commonly measured in the interplanetary CMEs. The model results depend strongly on the physical parameters in the ambient corona, namely the coronal magnetic field, the electron density and temperature during the CME event. It is crucial to obtain these ambient coronal parameters and as many facets of the CS properties as possible by observational means so that the post-CME current sheet models can be scrutinized more effectively."

We identified 11 CS, 8 H13CO+, and 6 SiO clumps with radii of 0.1-0.5pc. The CS and H13CO+ clumps are mainly divided into two velocity components, one at 4kms-1 and the other at 12kms-1, while the SiO clumps have velocities between the two components. The SiO emission is distributed toward the UCHII ring, where the 4kms-1 component clumps of CS and H13CO+ also exist. The 12kms-1 component clumps of CS are detected at the east and west of the UCHII ring with an apparent hole toward the ring. The clump masses vary from 4.4x10^2 M_SUN to 4.9x10^4 M_SUN with the mean values of 0.94x10^4M_SUN, 0.88x10^4M_SUN, and 2.2x10^4M_SUN for the CS, H13CO+, and SiO clumps, respectively. The total masses derived from CS, H13CO+, and SiO clumps are 1.0x10^5M_SUN, 0.70x10^5M_SUN, and 1.3x10^5 M_SUN, respectively, which agree well with the corresponding virial masses of 0.71x10^5M_SUN, 1.3x10^5M_SUN, and 0.88x10^5M_SUN, respectively. The average molecular hydrogen densities of the clumps are 0.90x10^6 cm-3, 1.4x10^6cm-3, and 7.6x10^6 cm-3 for the CS, H13CO+ and SiO clumps, respectively. The density derived from the SiO clumps seems significantly higher than those from the others, probably because the SiO emission is produced in high density shocked regions. The free fall time scale of the clumps is estimated to be ~3x10^4 yr, which gives an accretion rate of 3x10-3-1M_SUN yr-1 onto a stellar core. The observed clumps are, if they are undergoing free fall, capable of producing dozens of massive stars in the next 10^5 yr. We propose a view that pre-existing two clouds collided with each other almost face-on to produce the observed clumps and triggered the burst of massive star formation in W49N."

    "summary": "In the era of generative AI, the widespread adoption of Neural Text Generators (NTGs) presents new cybersecurity challenges, particularly within the realms of Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR). These challenges primarily involve the detection and attribution of sources behind advanced attacks like spearphishing and disinformation campaigns. As NTGs evolve, the task of distinguishing between human and NTG-authored texts becomes critically complex. This paper rigorously evaluates the DFIR pipeline tailored for text-based security systems, specifically focusing on the challenges of detecting and attributing authorship of NTG-authored texts. By introducing a novel human-NTG co-authorship text attack, termed CS-ACT, our study uncovers significant vulnerabilities in traditional DFIR methodologies, highlighting discrepancies between ideal scenarios and real-world conditions. Utilizing 14 diverse datasets and 43 unique NTGs, up to the latest GPT-4, our research identifies substantial vulnerabilities in the forensic profiling phase, particularly in attributing authorship to NTGs. Our comprehensive evaluation points to factors such as model sophistication and the lack of distinctive style within NTGs as significant contributors for these vulnerabilities. Our findings underscore the necessity for more sophisticated and adaptable strategies, such as incorporating adversarial learning, stylizing NTGs, and implementing hierarchical attribution through the mapping of NTG lineages to enhance source attribution. This sets the stage for future research and the development of more resilient text-based security systems."

For integral CS level k and for solitons carrying integral CS number, YMCS is gauge-invariant and consistent. However, individual solitons such as sphalerons and linked center vortices with CS number of 1/2 and writhing center vortices with arbitrary CS number are non-compact; a condensate of them threatens compactness of the theory. We study various forms of the non-compact theory in the dilute-gas approximation, treating the parameters of non-compact large gauge transformations as collective coordinates. We conclude: 1) YMCS theory dynamically compactifies; non-compact YMCS have infinitely higher vacuum energy than compact YMCS. 2) An odd number of sphalerons is associated with a domain- wall sphaleron, a pure-gauge configuration on a closed surface enclosing them and with a half-integral CS number. 3) We interpret the domain-wall sphaleron in terms of fictitious closed Abelian magnetic field lines that express the links of the Hopf fibration. Sphalerons are over- and under-crossings of knots in the field lines; the domain-wall sphaleron is a superconducting wall confining these knots to a compact domain. 4) Analogous results hold for center vortices and nexuses. 5) For a CS term induced with an odd number of fermion doublets, domain-wall sphalerons are related to non-normalizable fermion modes. 6) GGCS with monopoles is compactified with center-vortex-like strings."

The survey asked about the graduates' perceptions within a continuum of WiL experiences from final year capstone projects to professional development in their first industry-based role. Most respondents had taken a capstone course involving a team project. Only two respondents had participated in an internship program. Our results indicate that graduates value their capstone experiences and believe that they provide transferable skills including teamwork, managing client relations, exposure to technologies and methods, and time management. When entering their first industry role less than fifty percent of graduates were allocated a mentor. Overwhelmingly, these graduates noted the importance of those mentors in their transition from student to working professional. Very few of the surveyed graduates were provided with ongoing professional development opportunities. Those who did noted significant gains including growth of leadership skills and accelerated career progression.

    "summary": "The Cold Spot (CS) is a clear feature in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB); it could be of primordial origin, or caused by a intervening structure along the line of sight. We identified a large projected underdensity in the recently constructed WISE-2MASS all-sky infrared galaxy catalogue aligned with the Cold Spot direction at . It has an angular size of tens of degrees, and shows a galaxy underdensity in the center. Moreover, we find another large underdensity in the projected WISE-2MASS galaxy map at (hereafter Draco Supervoid), also aligned with a CMB decrement, although less significant than that of the CS direction. Motivated by these findings, we develop spherically symmetric Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) compensated void models to explain the observed CMB decrements with these two underdensities, or \"supervoids\". Within our perturbative treatment of the LTB voids, we find that the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe and Riess-Sciama effects due to the Draco Supervoid can account for the CMB decrement observed in the same direction. On the contrary, the extremely deep CMB decrement in the CS direction is more difficult to explain by the presence of the CS supervoid only. Nevertheless, the probability of a random alignment between the CS and the corresponding supervoid is disfavored, and thus its contribution as a secondary anisotropy cannot be neglected. We comment on how the approximations used in this paper, in particular the assumption of spherical symmetry, could change quantitatively our conclusions and might provide a better explanation for the CMB CS."

    "summary": "In many naturally occurring optimization problems one needs to ensure that the definition of the optimization problem lends itself to solutions that are tractable to compute. In cases where exact solutions cannot be computed tractably, it is beneficial to have strong guarantees on the tractable approximate solutions. In order operate under these criterion most optimization problems are cast under the umbrella of convexity or submodularity. In this report we will study design and optimization over a common class of functions called submodular functions. Set functions, and specifically submodular set functions, characterize a wide variety of naturally occurring optimization problems, and the property of submodularity of set functions has deep theoretical consequences with wide ranging applications. Informally, the property of submodularity of set functions concerns the intuitive \"principle of diminishing returns. This property states that adding an element to a smaller set has more value than adding it to a larger set. Common examples of submodular monotone functions are entropies, concave functions of cardinality, and matroid rank functions; non-monotone examples include graph cuts, network flows, and mutual information. In this paper we will review the formal definition of submodularity; the optimization of submodular functions, both maximization and minimization; and finally discuss some applications in relation to learning and reasoning using submodular functions."

    "summary": "Known for their capacity-achieving abilities, polar codes have been selected as the control channel coding scheme for 5G communications. To satisfy the needs of high throughput and low latency, belief propagation (BP) is chosen as the decoding algorithm. However, in general, the error performance of BP is worse than that of enhanced successive cancellation (SC). Recently, critical-set bit-flipping (CS-BF) is applied to BP decoding to lower the error rate. However, its trial and error process result in even longer latency. In this work, we propose a convolutional neural network-assisted bit-flipping (CNN-BF) mechanism to further enhance BP decoding of polar codes. With carefully designed input data and model architecture, our proposed CNN-BF can achieve much higher prediction accuracy and better error correction capability than CS-BF but with only half latency. It also achieves a lower block error rate (BLER) than SC list (CA-SCL)."

In this work, we apply data visualization and machine learning (ML) techniques to reveal unexpected correlations between composition, temperature, and material properties while using high throughput, in situ environmental photoluminescence (PL) experiments. Correlation heatmaps show the strong influence of Cs content on film degradation, and dimensionality reduction visualization methods uncover clear composition-based data clusters. An extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost) effectively forecasts PL features for ten perovskite films with both composition-agnostic (>85% accuracy) and composition-dependent (>75% accuracy) model approaches, while elucidating the relative feature importance of composition (up to 99%). This model validates a previously unseen anti-correlation between Cs content and material thermal stability. Our ML-based framework can be expanded to any perovskite family, significantly reducing the analysis time currently employed to identify stable options for photovoltaics."

    "summary": "While open databases are an important resource in the Deep Learning (DL) era, they are sometimes used \"off-label\": data published for one task are used for training algorithms for a different one. This work aims to highlight that in some cases, this common practice may lead to biased, overly-optimistic results. We demonstrate this phenomenon for inverse problem solvers and show how their biased performance stems from hidden data preprocessing pipelines. We describe two preprocessing pipelines typical of open-access databases and study their effects on three well-established algorithms developed for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction: Compressed Sensing (CS), Dictionary Learning (DictL), and DL. In this large-scale study we performed extensive computations. Our results demonstrate that the CS, DictL and DL algorithms yield systematically biased results when naively trained on seemingly-appropriate data: the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) improves consistently with the preprocessing extent, showing an artificial increase of 25%-48% in some cases. Since this phenomenon is generally unknown, biased results are sometimes published as state-of-the-art; we refer to that as subtle data crimes. This work hence raises a red flag regarding naive off-label usage of Big Data and reveals the vulnerability of modern inverse problem solvers to the resulting bias."

By combining current CMB polarization measurements, the seven-year WMAP, BOOMERanG 2003 and BICEP observations, we obtain a tight constraint on the rotation angle deg ( ), indicating a detection of the CPT violation. Here, we particularly take the systematic errors of CMB measurements into account. After adding the QUaD polarization data, the constraint becomes deg at 95% confidence level. When comparing with the effect of electromagnetic CS term, the gravitational CS term could only generate TB and EB power spectra with much smaller amplitude. Therefore, the induced parameter can not be constrained from the current polarization data. Furthermore, we study the capabilities of future CMB measurements, Planck and CMBPol, on the constraints of and . We find that the constraint of can be significantly improved by a factor of 15.

    "title": "Compressed Sensing Parallel MRI with Adaptive Shrinkage TV Regularization",
    "summary": "Compressed sensing (CS) methods in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer rapid acquisition and improved image quality but require iterative reconstruction schemes with regularization to enforce sparsity. Regardless of the difficulty in obtaining a fast numerical solution, the total variation (TV) regularization is a preferred choice due to its edge-preserving and structure recovery capabilities. While many approaches have been proposed to overcome the non-differentiability of the TV cost term, an iterative shrinkage based formulation allows recovering an image through recursive application of linear filtering and soft thresholding. However, providing an optimal setting for the regularization parameter is critical due to its direct impact on the rate of convergence as well as steady state error. In this paper, a regularizer adaptively varying in the derivative space is proposed, that follows the generalized discrepancy principle (GDP). The implementation proceeds by adaptively reducing the discrepancy level expressed as the absolute difference between TV norms of the consistency error and the sparse approximation error. A criterion based on the absolute difference between TV norms of consistency and sparse approximation errors is used to update the threshold. Application of the adaptive shrinkage TV regularizer to CS recovery of parallel MRI (pMRI) and temporal gradient adaptation in dynamic MRI are shown to result in improved image quality with accelerated convergence. In addition, the adaptive TV-based iterative shrinkage (ATVIS) provides a significant speed advantage over the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA)."

    "summary": "Recently, Deep Unfolding Networks (DUNs) have achieved impressive reconstruction quality in the field of image Compressive Sensing (CS) by unfolding iterative optimization algorithms into neural networks. The reconstruction quality of DUNs depends on the learned prior knowledge, so introducing stronger prior knowledge can further improve reconstruction quality. On the other hand, pre-trained diffusion models contain powerful prior knowledge and have a solid theoretical foundation and strong scalability, but it requires a large number of iterative steps to achieve reconstruction. In this paper, we propose to use the powerful prior knowledge of pre-trained diffusion model in DUNs to achieve high-quality reconstruction with less steps for image CS. Specifically, we first design an iterative optimization algorithm named Diffusion Message Passing (DMP), which embeds a pre-trained diffusion model into each iteration process of DMP. Then, we deeply unfold the DMP algorithm into a neural network named DMP-DUN. The proposed DMP-DUN can use lightweight neural networks to achieve mapping from measurement data to the intermediate steps of the reverse diffusion process and directly approximate the divergence of the diffusion model, thereby further improving reconstruction efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our proposed DMP-DUN achieves state-of-the-art performance and requires at least only 2 steps to reconstruct the image.

An axion-like field has been built-in as the extra-space component of the higher dimensional gauge field. The coupling of with gluons is attributed to the radiatively induced \"Chern-Simons\" (CS) term. We adopt a toy model with some unknown gauge symmetry U(1) . The CS term is obtained in two ways: first by a concrete 1-loop calculation and next by use of the Fujikawa's method to deal with the chiral anomaly in 4D space-time. The obtained results are identical, which implies that the radiative correction to the CS term is \"1-loop exact\" and is also free from UV-divergence even though the theory itself is non-renormalizable. As a novel feature of this scenario, such obtained CS term is no longer linear in the field as in the usually discussed CS term in 5D space-time but a periodic function of , since has a physical meaning as the Wilson-loop phase. We argue how such novel feature of this scenario causes the modification of the ordinary solutions of the strong CP problem based on the axion fields."

Analysis of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and Planck surveys revealed several CS candidates.

We observed the brightest of the objects in the CSc-1 field, a galaxy pair SDSSJ110429.61+233150.3. The significant correlation between the spectra of the two components indicates the possible GL nature of the pair. Our simulations of observational data in the CSc-1 field shows that a large number of pairs can be explained by the complex geometry of the CS. Simulations of the SDSSJ110429 galaxy pair has shown that the observed angle between the components of the pair can be explained if the CS is strongly inclined and, possibly, bent in the image plane. In our preliminary data, we also detected the sign of the sharp isophotal edge in one image, which along with CMB and spectral data strongly suggests the possibility of a CS detection."

Because single-star evolution at the low stellar mass of present-epoch GCs was considered incapable of producing visible PNe, their origin presented a puzzle. We imaged the PN JaFu 1 with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to obtain photometry of its central star (CS) and high-resolution morphological information. We imaged IRAS 18333-2357 with better depth and resolution, and we analyzed its archival HST spectra to constrain its CS temperature and luminosity. All PNe in Galactic GCs now have high-quality HST data, allowing us to improve CS mass estimates. We find reasonably consistent masses between 0.53 and 0.58 Msun for all four objects, though estimates vary when adopting different stellar evolutionary calculations. The CS mass of IRAS 18333-2357, though, depends strongly on its temperature, which remains elusive due to reddening uncertainties. For all four objects, we consider their CS and nebular masses, their morphologies, and other incongruities to assess the likelihood that these objects formed from binary stars. Although generally limited by uncertainties (~0.02 Msun) in post-AGB tracks and core mass vs. luminosity relations, the high-mass CS in K 648 indicates a binary origin. The CS of JaFu 1 exhibits compact bright [O III] and Halpha emission, like EGB 6, suggesting a binary companion or disk. Evidence is weaker for a binary origin of JaFu 2."

It turns out that the circular polarization is sizable if the frequency of the GW is comparable to a critical value determined by the characteristic CS length scale and the energy scale of the axion domain wall. Thus, observations of the circular polarization could give a stringent constraint on the characteristic CS length scale or could be a new avenue to search for axion."

    "summary": "We study the asymmetric interaction of wave-like velocity perturbation with a coronal current sheet (CS) in the presence of resistivity, thermal conduction (TC) and radiative cooling (RC). We analyze the dynamics and energetics of CS in four cases, namely, (i) no energy loss, (ii) TC only, (iii) RC only and, (iv) TC+RC. Before fragmentation, thinning and elongation of the CS are found to be identical in all four cases and therefore independent of presence or absence of energy loss effects. Onset times, corresponding Lundquist numbers and aspect ratios suggest that TC advances the onset of fragmentation while RC has the opposite effect in comparison to absence of energy losses. Reconnection takes place at a higher rate in presence of TC and TC+RC in the tearing unstable CS. The speed of plasmoids are also found to be higher under the effect of TC and TC+RC. In presence of TC and TC+RC, average density becomes higher within the tearing unstable CS than in other two cases. As expected, estimated average temperature is increasing with highest and lowest rate in absence of energy losses and in presence of both TC and RC respectively. After the onset of fragmentation, the rate of decrement of average magnetic energy density and increment of average kinetic energy density becomes higher in presence of TC and TC+RC than in other two cases. Thus we conclude that presence of energy loss mechanisms critically influence the dynamics, energetics, and plasmoid formation within a reconnecting coronal CS."

    "summary": "The need to immobilize low-level nuclear waste, in particular 137Cs-bearing waste, has led to a growing interest in geopolymer-based waste matrices, in addition to optimization attempts of cement matrix compositions for this specific application. Although the overall phase composition and structure of these matrices are well characterized, the binding sites of Cs in these materials have not been clearly identified. Recent studies have suggested that combining the sensitivity of solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SSNMR) to the local atomic structure with other structural techniques provides insights into the mode of Cs binding and release. Density Functional Theory (DFT) can provide the connection between spectroscopic parameters and geometric properties. However, the reliability of DFT results strongly relies on the choice of a suitable exchange-correlation functional, which for 133Cs, the NMR surrogate for such studies, is not well-established. In this work we benchmark various functionals against their performance in predicting the geometry of various simple Cs compounds, their NMR quadrupolar coupling constants, and their chemical shift values, while prioritizing the ability to incorporate dispersion interactions and maintaining low computational cost. We examined Cs salts, Cs oxides, perovskites, caged materials, a borate glass and a cesium fluoroscandate. While no single functional performs equally well for all parameters, the results show rev-vdW-DF2 and PBEsol+D3 to be leading candidates for these systems, in particular with respect to geometry and chemical shifts, which are of high importance for Cs-immobilization matrices."

Specifically, a non-orthogonal downlink pilot design is first proposed, which is very different from standard orthogonal pilots. By exploiting the spatially common sparsity of massive MIMO channels, a compressive sensing (CS) based adaptive CSI acquisition scheme is proposed, where the consumed time slot overhead only adaptively depends on the sparsity level of the channels. Additionally, a distributed sparsity adaptive matching pursuit algorithm is proposed to jointly estimate the channels of multiple subcarriers. Furthermore, by exploiting the temporal channel correlation, a closed-loop channel tracking scheme is provided, which adaptively designs the non-orthogonal pilot according to the previous channel estimation to achieve an enhanced CSI acquisition. Finally, we generalize the results of the multiple-measurement-vectors case in CS and derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound of the proposed scheme, which enlightens us to design the non-orthogonal pilot signals for the improved performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms its counterparts, and it is capable of approaching the performance bound."

Students across noncomputing disciplines need to apply sophisticated computational skills and methods to fields as diverse as biology, linguistics, and art. Furthermore, computing plays a critical role in \"momentous geopolitical events\", such as elections in several countries including the US, and is changing how people \"work, collaborate, communicate, shop, eat, travel, get news and entertainment, and quite simply live\". Traditional computing courses, however, fail to equip non-computing discipline students with the necessary computing skills - if they can even get into classes packed with CS majors. A pressing question facing academics today is: How do we effectively integrate computing skills that are useful for the discipline into discipline curricula? We advocate an approach where courses in discipline X include the computing relevant to the learning outcomes of that course, as used by practitioners in X. We refer to the computing skills relevant to a course in discipline X as an \"ounce of computing skills\", to highlight our belief regarding the amount of computing to be integrated in that course. In this article, we outline our insights regarding the development of an ounce of computing skills for a discipline course, and the evaluation of the developed ounce. The key takeaways are that the goal has to be to advance students in their disciplines, and only the disciplinary experts can tell us how computing is used in that discipline. Computer scientists know how to teach computing, but the classes can't be about CS values. The disciplinary values are paramount."

    "summary": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction is an active inverse problem which can be addressed by conventional compressed sensing (CS) MRI algorithms that exploit the sparse nature of MRI in an iterative optimization-based manner. However, two main drawbacks of iterative optimization-based CSMRI methods are time-consuming and are limited in model capacity. Meanwhile, one main challenge for recent deep learning-based CSMRI is the trade-off between model performance and network size. To address the above issues, we develop a new multi-scale dilated network for MRI reconstruction with high speed and outstanding performance. Comparing to convolutional kernels with same receptive fields, dilated convolutions reduce network parameters with smaller kernels and expand receptive fields of kernels to obtain almost same information. To maintain the abundance of features, we present global and local residual learnings to extract more image edges and details. Then we utilize concatenation layers to fuse multi-scale features and residual learnings for better reconstruction. Compared with several non-deep and deep learning CSMRI algorithms, the proposed method yields better reconstruction accuracy and noticeable visual improvements. In addition, we perform the noisy setting to verify the model stability, and then extend the proposed model on a MRI super-resolution task."

Existing methods mainly focus on learning better uncertainty scores but dismiss the importance of feature representations. We find that features with richer semantic diversity can significantly improve the open-set performance under the same uncertainty scores. In this paper, we begin with analyzing the feature representation behavior in the open-set action recognition (OSAR) problem based on the information bottleneck (IB) theory, and propose to enlarge the instance-specific (IS) and class-specific (CS) information contained in the feature for better performance. To this end, a novel Prototypical Similarity Learning (PSL) framework is proposed to keep the instance variance within the same class to retain more IS information. Besides, we notice that unknown samples sharing similar appearances to known samples are easily misclassified as known classes. To alleviate this issue, video shuffling is further introduced in our PSL to learn distinct temporal information between original and shuffled samples, which we find enlarges the CS information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PSL can significantly boost both the open-set and closed-set performance and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.

Finding an effective prior to describe the statistical distribution of the image family of interest is crucial for model-based methods. Plug-and-play (PnP) is a general framework that uses denoising algorithms as the prior or regularizer. Recent work showed that PnP methods with denoisers based on pretrained convolutional neural networks outperform other classical regularizers in CS MRI reconstruction. However, the numerical solvers for PnP can be slow for CS MRI reconstruction. This paper proposes a preconditioned PnP (P^2nP) method to accelerate the convergence speed. Moreover, we provide proofs of the fixed-point convergence of the P^2nP iterates. Numerical experiments on CS MRI reconstruction with non-Cartesian sampling trajectories illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the P^2nP approach."

    "summary": "In practical compressed sensing (CS), the obtained measurements typically necessitate quantization to a limited number of bits prior to transmission or storage. This nonlinear quantization process poses significant recovery challenges, particularly with extreme coarse quantization such as 1-bit. Recently, an efficient algorithm called QCS-SGM was proposed for quantized CS (QCS) which utilizes score-based generative models (SGM) as an implicit prior. Due to the adeptness of SGM in capturing the intricate structures of natural signals, QCS-SGM substantially outperforms previous QCS methods. However, QCS-SGM is constrained to (approximately) row-orthogonal sensing matrices as the computation of the likelihood score becomes intractable otherwise. To address this limitation, we introduce an advanced variant of QCS-SGM, termed QCS-SGM+, capable of handling general matrices effectively. The key idea is a Bayesian inference perspective on the likelihood score computation, wherein expectation propagation is employed for its approximate computation. Extensive experiments are conducted, demonstrating the substantial superiority of QCS-SGM+ over QCS-SGM for general sensing matrices beyond mere row-orthogonality."

However, as commercial use expands, LEO satellite networks face heightened cyberattack risks, especially through satellite-to-satellite communication links, which are more vulnerable than ground-based connections. As the number of operational satellites continues to grow, addressing these security challenges becomes increasingly critical. Traditional approaches, which focus on sending models to ground stations for validation, often overlook the limited communication windows available to LEO satellites, leaving critical security risks unaddressed. To tackle these challenges, we propose a sharded blockchain-based federated learning framework for LEO networks, called SBFL-LEO. This framework improves the reliability of inter-satellite communications using blockchain technology and assigns specific roles to each satellite. Miner satellites leverage cosine similarity (CS) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to identify malicious models and monitor each other to detect inaccurate aggregated models. Security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods in both model accuracy and energy efficiency, significantly enhancing system robustness against attacks."

In this paper, we propose an ISAC processing framework relying on millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Specifically, we provide a compressed sampling (CS) perspective to facilitate ISAC processing, which can not only recover the high-dimensional channel state information or/and radar imaging information, but also significantly reduce pilot overhead. First, an energy-efficient widely spaced array (WSA) architecture is tailored for the radar receiver, which enhances the angular resolution of radar sensing at the cost of angular ambiguity. Then, we propose an ISAC frame structure for time-varying ISAC systems considering different timescales. The pilot waveforms are judiciously designed by taking into account both CS theories and hardware constraints induced by hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture. Next, we design the dedicated dictionary for WSA that serves as a building block for formulating the ISAC processing as sparse signal recovery problems. The orthogonal matching pursuit with support refinement (OMP-SR) algorithm is proposed to effectively solve the problems in the existence of the angular ambiguity. We also provide a framework for estimating the Doppler frequencies during payload data transmission to guarantee communication performances. Simulation results demonstrate the good performances of both communications and radar sensing under the proposed ISAC framework."

Different from the state-of-the-art slotted transmission scheme, the data in the proposed framework is split into only two parts. A portion of the data is coded by compressed sensing (CS) and the rest is low-density-parity-check (LDPC) coded. In addition to being part of the data, information bits in the CS phase also undertake the task of interleaving pattern design and channel estimation (CE). The principle of interleave-division multiple access (IDMA) is exploited to reduce the interference among devices in the LDPC phase. Based on the belief propagation (BP) algorithm, a low-complexity iterative message passing (MP) algorithm is utilized to decode the data embedded in these two phases separately. Moreover, combined with successive interference cancellation (SIC), the proposed joint DAD-CE-DD algorithm is performed to further improve performance by utilizing the belief of each other. Additionally, based on the energy detection (ED) and sliding window protocol (SWP), we develop a collision resolution protocol to handle the codeword collision, a common issue in the URA system. In addition to the complexity reduction, the proposed algorithm exhibits a substantial performance enhancement compared to the state-of-the-art in terms of efficiency and accuracy."

The CS algorithm is implemented using two different operator bases, namely, the standard Pauli basis and the Pauli-error basis. We experimentally demonstrate that the performance of the CS algorithm is significantly better in the Pauli-error basis, where the constructed matrix is maximally sparse. We compare the standard least square (LS) optimization QPT method with the CS-QPT method and observe that, provided an appropriate basis is chosen, the CS-QPT method performs significantly better as compared to the LS-QPT method. In all the cases considered, we obtained experimental fidelities greater than 0.9 from a reduced data set, which was approximately five to six times smaller in size than a full data set. We also experimentally characterized the reduced dynamics of a two-qubit subsystem embedded in a three-qubit system, and used the CS-QPT method to characterize processes corresponding to the evolution of two-qubit states under various -coupling interactions."

    "summary": "While training models and labeling data are resource-intensive, a wealth of pre-trained models and unlabeled data exists. To effectively utilize these resources, we present an approach to actively select pre-trained models while minimizing labeling costs. We frame this as an online contextual active model selection problem: At each round, the learner receives an unlabeled data point as a context. The objective is to adaptively select the best model to make a prediction while limiting label requests. To tackle this problem, we propose CAMS, a contextual active model selection algorithm that relies on two novel components: (1) a contextual model selection mechanism, which leverages context information to make informed decisions about which model is likely to perform best for a given context, and (2) an active query component, which strategically chooses when to request labels for data points, minimizing the overall labeling cost. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis for the regret and query complexity under both adversarial and stochastic settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on a diverse collection of benchmark classification tasks. Notably, CAMS requires substantially less labeling effort (less than 10%) compared to existing methods on CIFAR10 and DRIFT benchmarks, while achieving similar or better accuracy.

Existing large language models (LLMS) can achieve high token matching scores in terms of likelihood for molecule generation. However, relying solely on LLM decoding often results in the generation of molecules that are either invalid due to a single misused token, or suboptimal due to unbalanced exploration and exploitation as a consequence of the LLMs prior experience. Here we propose ERP, Entropy-Reinforced Planning for Transformer Decoding, which employs an entropy-reinforced planning algorithm to enhance the Transformer decoding process and strike a balance between exploitation and exploration. ERP aims to achieve improvements in multiple properties compared to direct sampling from the Transformer. We evaluated ERP on the SARS-CoV-2 virus (3CLPro) and human cancer cell target protein (RTCB) benchmarks and demonstrated that, in both benchmarks, ERP consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithm by 1-5 percent, and baselines by 5-10 percent, respectively. Moreover, such improvement is robust across Transformer models trained with different objectives. Finally, to further illustrate the capabilities of ERP, we tested our algorithm on three code generation benchmarks and outperformed the current state-of-the-art approach as well.

Since the onboard sensors of ACVs can capture new data as they move along their trajectories, the continual arrival of such 'newly' sensed data leads to online learning and demands carefully crafting the trajectories. Besides, as typical ACVs are inherently resource-constrained, computation- and communication-efficient ML solutions are needed. Therefore, we propose a computation- and communication-efficient online aerial federated learning (2CEOAFL) algorithm to take the benefits of continual sensed data and limited onboard resources of the ACVs. In particular, considering independently owned ACVs act as selfish data collectors, we first model their trajectories according to their respective time-varying data distributions. We then propose a 2CEOAFL algorithm that allows the flying ACVs to (a) prune the received dense ML model to make it shallow, (b) train the pruned model, and (c) probabilistically quantize and offload their trained accumulated gradients to the central server (CS). Our extensive simulation results show that the proposed 2CEOAFL algorithm delivers comparable performances to its non-pruned and nonquantized, hence, computation- and communication-inefficient counterparts."

Adding the usual CS term for the broken U(1) gauge fields does not change much. It merely leads to additional Aharonov-Bohm interactions among these particles.

Life-long learning machines must inherently resolve the plasticity-stability paradox. Striking a balance between acquiring new knowledge and maintaining stability is crucial for artificial agents. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from machine learning technology and introduce a biologically plausible implementation of proximal policy optimization, referred to as lf-cs (learning fast changing slow). Our approach results in two notable advancements: firstly, the capacity to assimilate new information into a new policy without requiring alterations to the current policy; and secondly, the capability to replay experiences without experiencing policy divergence. Furthermore, when contrasted with other experience replay (ER) techniques, our method demonstrates the added advantage of being computationally efficient in an online setting. We demonstrate that the proposed methodology enhances the efficiency of learning, showcasing its potential impact on neuromorphic and real-world applications."

The beams will be produced from H-/D- ions, generated by a radiofrequency plasma source coupled to an ion acceleration system. A prototype of the ITER HNB ion source is being tested in the SPIDER experiment, part of the ITER Neutral Beam Test Facility at Consorzio RFX. Reaching the design targets for beam current density and fraction of coextracted electrons is only possible by evaporating cesium in the source, in particular on the plasma facing grid (PG) of the acceleration system. In this way the work function of the surfaces decreases, significantly increasing the amount of surface reactions that convert neutrals and positive ions into H-/D-. It is then of paramount importance to monitor the density of negative ions and the density of Cs in the proximity of the PG. Monitoring the Cs spatial distribution along the PG is also essential to guarantee the uniformity of the beam current. In SPIDER, this is possible thanks to the Cavity Ringdown Spectroscopy (CRDS) and the Laser absorption Spectroscopy diagnostics (LAS), which provide line-integrated measurements of negative ion density and neutral, ground state Cs density, respectively. The paper discusses the CRDS and LAS measurements as a function of input power and of the magnetic and electric fields used to reduce the coextraction of electrons. Negative ion density data are in qualitative agreement with the analogous measurements in Cs-free conditions. In agreement with simulations, Cs density is peaked in the center of the source; a top/bottom non uniformity is also present.

Compressive sensing (CS) channel estimation techniques usually adopt the (overcomplete) wavelet/Fourier transform matrix as a sparsifying dictionary. This may not be the best choice when considering non-uniform arrays, antenna gain/phase errors, mutual coupling effects, etc. We propose two dictionary learning (DL) algorithms to learn the best sparsifying dictionaries for channel matrices from observations obtained with hybrid frequency-selective mmWave multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. First, we optimize the combined dictionary, i.e., the Kronecker product of transmit and receive dictionaries, as it is used in practice to sparsify the channel matrix. Second, considering the different array structures at the transmitter and receiver, we exploit separable DL to find the best transmit and receive dictionaries. Once the channel is expressed in terms of the optimized dictionaries, various CS-based sparse recovery techniques can be applied for low overhead channel estimation. The proposed DL algorithms perform well under low SNR conditions inherent to any mmWave communication systems before the precoders/combiners can be optimized. The effectiveness of the proposed DL algorithms has been corroborated via numerical simulations with different system configurations, array geometries and hardware impairments."

The measurement of the H2 content provides the most direct probe of the total amount of CS gas, especially in the inner warm planet-forming regions of the disks. Aims: Most Herbig Be stars (HBes) are distant from the Sun and their nature and evolution are still debated. We therefore conducted mid-infrared observations of H2 as a tracer of warm gas around HBes known to have gas-rich CS environments. Methods: We report a search for the H2 S(1) emission line at 17.0348 microns in the CS environments of 5 HBes with the high resolution spectroscopic mode of VISIR (ESO VLT Imager and Spectrometer for the mid-InfraRed). Results: No source shows evidence for H2 emission at 17.0348 microns. Stringent 3sigma upper limits on the integrated line fluxes are derived. Depending on the adopted temperature, limits on column densities and masses of warm gas are also estimated. These non-detections constrain the amount of warm (>150 K) gas in the immediate CS environments of our target stars to be less than 1-10 Jupiter masses."

The required sampling rates are up to 4 times the Nyquist rate of the signal and result in considerable amount of data, that needs to be stored and processed. A developed technique, based on the finite rate of innovation model, compressed sensing (CS) and Xampling ideas, allows to reduce the number of samples needed to reconstruct an image comprised of strong reflectors. A significant drawback of this method is its inability to treat speckle, which is of significant importance in medical imaging. Here we build on previous work and show explicitly how to perform beamforming in the Fourier domain. Beamforming in frequency exploits the low bandwidth of the beamformed signal and allows to bypass the oversampling dictated by digital implementation of beamforming in time. We show that this allows to obtain the same beamformed image as in standard beamforming but from far fewer samples. Finally, we present an analysis based CS-technique that allows for further reduction in sampling rate, using only a portion of the beamformed signal's bandwidth, namely, sampling the signal at sub-Nyquist rates. We demonstrate our methods on in vivo cardiac ultrasound data and show that reductions up to 1/25 over standard beamforming rates are possible."

To mitigate this, we propose YOSO (You-Only-Sample-Once), an algorithm designed to achieve efficient training while preserving prediction accuracy. YOSO introduces a compressed sensing (CS)-based sampling and reconstruction framework, where nodes are sampled once at input layer, followed by a lossless reconstruction at the output layer per epoch. By integrating the reconstruction process with the loss function of specific learning tasks, YOSO not only avoids costly computations in traditional compressed sensing (CS) methods, such as orthonormal basis calculations, but also ensures high-probability accuracy retention which equivalent to full node participation. Experimental results on node classification and link prediction demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of YOSO, reducing GNN training by an average of 75\\% compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining accuracy on par with top-performing baselines."

The motivation behind this approach is to model the higher-order statistical dependencies between the coefficients of the sparse representation, with the final goal of improving the reconstruction. The performance of the proposed method is validated on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and the MNIST Database of handwritten digits."

    "title": "Exploiting Correlation in Sparse Signal Recovery Problems: Multiple Measurement Vectors, Block Sparsity, and Time-Varying Sparsity",
    "summary": "A trend in compressed sensing (CS) is to exploit structure for improved reconstruction performance. In the basic CS model, exploiting the clustering structure among nonzero elements in the solution vector has drawn much attention, and many algorithms have been proposed. However, few algorithms explicitly consider correlation within a cluster. Meanwhile, in the multiple measurement vector (MMV) model correlation among multiple solution vectors is largely ignored. Although several recently developed algorithms consider the exploitation of the correlation, these algorithms need to know a priori the correlation structure, thus limiting their effectiveness in practical problems. Recently, we developed a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm, namely T-SBL, and its variants, which adaptively learn the correlation structure and exploit such correlation information to significantly improve reconstruction performance. Here we establish their connections to other popular algorithms, such as the group Lasso, iterative reweighted and algorithms, and algorithms for time-varying sparsity. We also provide strategies to improve these existing algorithms."

    "summary": "Sulfur-bearing molecules play an important role in prebiotic chemistry and planet habitability. They are also proposed probes of chemical ages, elemental C/O ratio, and grain chemistry processing. Commonly detected in diverse astrophysical objects, including the Solar System, their distribution and chemistry remain, however, largely unknown in planet-forming disks. We present CS ( ) observations at resolution performed within the ALMA-MAPS Large Program toward the five disks around IM Lup, GM Aur, AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480. CS is detected in all five disks, displaying a variety of radial intensity profiles and spatial distributions across the sample, including intriguing apparent azimuthal asymmetries. Transitions of C S and SO were also serendipitously covered but only upper limits are found. For MWC 480, we present complementary ALMA observations at , of CS, CS, C S, H CS, OCS, and SO . We find a column density ratio N(H CS)/N(CS) , suggesting that a substantial part of the sulfur reservoir in disks is in organic form (i.e., C H S ). Using astrochemical disk modeling tuned to MWC 480, we demonstrate that (CS)/ (SO) is a promising probe for the elemental C/O ratio. The comparison with the observations provides a super-solar C/O. We also find a depleted gas-phase S/H ratio, suggesting either that part of the sulfur reservoir is locked in solid phase or that it remains in an unidentified gas-phase reservoir.

    "summary": "Fluorescence microscopy has been a significant tool to observe long-term imaging of embryos (in vivo) growth over time. However, cumulative exposure is phototoxic to such sensitive live samples. While techniques like light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) allow for reduced exposure, it is not well suited for deep imaging models. Other computational techniques are computationally expensive and often lack restoration quality. To address this challenge, one can use various low-dosage imaging techniques that are developed to achieve the 3D volume reconstruction using a few slices in the axial direction (z-axis); however, they often lack restoration quality. Also, acquiring dense images (with small steps) in the axial direction is computationally expensive. To address this challenge, we present a compressive sensing (CS) based approach to fully reconstruct 3D volumes with the same signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with less than half of the excitation dosage. We present the theory and experimentally validate the approach. To demonstrate our technique, we capture a 3D volume of the RFP labeled neurons in the zebrafish embryo spinal cord (30um thickness) with the axial sampling of 0.1um using a confocal microscope. From the results, we observe the CS-based approach achieves accurate 3D volume reconstruction from less than 20% of the entire stack optical sections. The developed CS-based methodology in this work can be easily applied to other deep imaging modalities such as two-photon and light-sheet microscopy, where reducing sample photo-toxicity is a critical challenge."

However, their capabilities to solve more challenging math problems which require domain-specific knowledge (i.e. theorem) have yet to be investigated. In this paper, we introduce TheoremQA, the first theorem-driven question-answering dataset designed to evaluate AI models' capabilities to apply theorems to solve challenging science problems. TheoremQA is curated by domain experts containing 800 high-quality questions covering 350 theorems (e.g. Taylor's theorem, Lagrange's theorem, Huffman coding, Quantum Theorem, Elasticity Theorem, etc) from Math, Physics, EE&CS, and Finance. We evaluate a wide spectrum of 16 large language and code models with different prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thoughts and Program-of-Thoughts. We found that GPT-4's capabilities to solve these problems are unparalleled, achieving an accuracy of 51% with Program-of-Thoughts Prompting. All the existing open-sourced models are below 15%, barely surpassing the random-guess baseline. Given the diversity and broad coverage of TheoremQA, we believe it can be used as a better benchmark to evaluate LLMs' capabilities to solve challenging science problems.

DDR renders pseudo-document pages by modeling randomized textual and non-textual contents of interest, with user-defined layout and font styles to support joint learning of fine-grained classes. We demonstrate competitive results using our DDR approach to extract nine document classes from the benchmark CS-150 and papers published in two domains, namely annual meetings of Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) and IEEE Visualization (VIS). We compare DDR to conditions of style mismatch, fewer or more noisy samples that are more easily obtained in the real world. We show that high-fidelity semantic information is not necessary to label semantic classes but style mismatch between train and test can lower model accuracy. Using smaller training samples had a slightly detrimental effect. Finally, network models still achieved high test accuracy when correct labels are diluted towards confusing labels; this behavior hold across several classes."

While it has its roots in non-monotonic logics, it can be applied to various areas in computer science, especially in explainable reasoning; its most central concept is a justification: an explanation why a property holds (or does not hold) in a model. In this paper, we continue the study of justification theory by means of three major contributions. The first is studying the relation between justification theory and game theory. We show that justification frameworks can be seen as a special type of games. The established connection provides the theoretical foundations for our next two contributions. The second contribution is studying under which condition two different dialects of justification theory (graphs as explanations vs trees as explanations) coincide. The third contribution is establishing a precise criterion of when a semantics induced by justification theory yields consistent results. In the past proving that such semantics were consistent took cumbersome and elaborate proofs. We show that these criteria are indeed satisfied for all common semantics of logic programming. This paper is under consideration for acceptance in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)."

    "summary": "We first derive the boundary theory from the U(1) Chern-Simons theory. The boundary action on an -sheet manifold appears from its back-reaction of the Wilson line. The reason is that the U(1) Chern-Simons theory can provide an exact effective action when introducing the Wilson line. The Wilson line in the pure AdS Einstein gravity is equivalent to entanglement entropy in the boundary theory up to classical gravity. The U(1) Chern-Simons theory deviates by a self-interaction term from the gauge formulation on the boundary. We also compare the Hayward term in the SL(2) Chern-Simons formulation to the Wilson line approach. Introducing two wedges can reproduce the entanglement entropy for a single interval at the classical level. We propose quantum generalization by combining the bulk and Hayward terms. The quantum correction of the partition function vanishes. In the end, we calculate the entanglement entropy for a single interval. The pure AdS Einstein gravity theory shows a shift of central charge by 26 at the one-loop level. The U(1) Chern-Simons theory does not show a shift from the quantum effect. The result is the same in the weak gravitational constant limit. The non-vanishing quantum correction shows that the Hayward term is incorrect."

This allows us to compare all variants in a uniform framework and ultimately combine them in a common implementation."

The method first computes a convolved image, which gives the convolution between a user-defined kernel and the unknown MR image, and then reconstructs the image by CS-based image deblurring, in which CS is applied for removing the inherent blur stemming from the convolution process. This method is hence termed CORE-Deblur. Retrospective subsampling experiments with data from a numerical brain phantom and in-vivo 7T brain scans showed that CORE-Deblur produced high-quality reconstructions, comparable to those of a conventional CS method, while reducing the number of iterations by a factor of 10 or more. The average Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) obtained by CORE-Deblur for the in-vivo datasets was 0.016. CORE-Deblur also exhibited robustness regarding the chosen kernel and compatibility with various k-space subsampling schemes, ranging from regular to random. In summary, CORE-Deblur enables high quality reconstructions and reduction of the CS iterations number by 10-fold."

Cs-137 either can enter the food chain or be consumed or if present in the environment (e.g. fallout) can provide external irradiation. In either case, due to the high penetration of the 662 keV gamma rays emitted by Cs-137, the individual will be exposed to a uniform, whole body, irradiation at low dose rates. The VADER (VAriable Dose-rate External Cs-137 irradiatoR) allows modeling these exposures, bypassing many of the problems inherent in internal emitter studies. Making use of discarded Cs-137 brachytherapy seeds, the VADER can provide varying low dose rate irradiations at dose rates of 0.1 to 1.2 Gy/day. The VADER includes a mouse \"hotel\", designed to allow long term simultaneous residency of up to 15 mice. Two source platters containing ~250 mCi each of Cs-137 brachytherapy seeds are mounted above and below the cage and can be moved under computer control to provide constant low dose rate or a varying dose rate mimicking Cs biokinetics in mouse or man.

We propose in this paper an end-to-end network, named CS-Net, to complete the point clouds contaminated by noises or containing outliers. In our CS-Net, the completion and segmentation modules work collaboratively to promote each other, benefited from our specifically designed cascaded structure. With the help of segmentation, more clean point cloud is fed into the completion module. We design a novel completion decoder which harnesses the labels obtained by segmentation together with FPS to purify the point cloud and leverages KNN-grouping for better generation. The completion and segmentation modules work alternately share the useful information from each other to gradually improve the quality of prediction. To train our network, we build a dataset to simulate the real case where incomplete point clouds contain outliers. Our comprehensive experiments and comparisons against state-of-the-art completion methods demonstrate our superiority. We also compare with the scheme of segmentation followed by completion and their end-to-end fusion, which also proves our efficacy."

We use a helper-based method that extends the definition of the G á cs-K ö rner-Witsenhausen (GKW) common information to functional common information. The helper relaxes the combinatorial structure of GKW by partitioning the joint source distribution into nests imposed by the function, which ensures hierarchical cooperation between the sources for effectively distributed computing. By contrasting our approach's performance with existing efficient techniques, we demonstrate the rate savings in recovering function and source data. Permutation invariant functions are prevalent in learning and combinatorial optimization fields and most recently applied to graph neural networks. We consider the efficient compression for computing permutation invariant functions in a network with two sources and one decoder. We use a bipartite graph representation, where two disjoint sets of vertices (parts) denote the individual source graphs and the edge weights capture the joint source distribution. We compress bipartite graphs by creating connected components determined by the function's distribution, accounting for the edge symmetries, and eliminating the low probability edges. We separately encode those edges and send them as refinements. Our approach can substitute high complexity joint decoding techniques and inform neural networks to reduce the computing time and reduce complexity."

However, considering the complicated traffic environments and driving scenarios, deploying federated learning for autonomous vehicles is inevitably challenged by non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data of vehicles, which may lead to failed convergence and low training accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchically Federated Region-learning framework of Autonomous Vehicles (FedRAV), a two-stage framework, which adaptively divides a large area containing vehicles into sub-regions based on the defined region-wise distance, and achieves personalized vehicular models and regional models. This approach ensures that the personalized vehicular model adopts the beneficial models while discarding the unprofitable ones. We validate our FedRAV framework against existing federated learning algorithms on three real-world autonomous driving datasets in various heterogeneous settings. The experiment results demonstrate that our framework outperforms those known algorithms, and improves the accuracy by at least 3.69%.

    "title": "Low-Overhead Hierarchically-Sparse Channel Estimation for Multiuser Wideband Massive MIMO",
    "summary": "The problem of excessive pilot overhead required for uplink massive MIMO channel estimation is well known, let alone when it is considered along with wideband (OFDM) transmissions. Towards channel estimators that are both efficient and require low-training overhead, compressive sensing (CS) approaches have been increasingly popular, exploiting the sparse nature of the physical channel. However, no analytical insights regarding the overhead required for reliable channel estimation in wideband massive MIMO are available. By observing that the wideband massive MIMO channel can be represented by a vector that is not simply sparse but has well defined structural properties, referred to as hierarchical sparsity, we propose low complexity channel estimators for the multiuser scenario that take this property into account. By employing the framework of the hierarchical restricted isometry property, rigorous performance guarantees for these algorithms are provided suggesting concrete design goals for the user pilot sequences. For a specific design, we analytically characterize the scaling of the required pilot overhead with increasing number of antennas and bandwidth, revealing that, as long as the number of antennas is sufficiently large, it is independent of the per user channel sparsity level as well as the number of active users. Hence, surprisingly, in contrast to the classical setting, pilot overhead can be shifted into spatial dimensions not affecting crucial bandwidth constraints thereby increasing the overall system capacity. These analytical insights are verified by simulation results demonstrating also the superiority of the proposed algorithm over conventional CS algorithms that ignore the hierarchical sparsity property."

    "title": "The MUSIC Algorithm for Sparse Objects: A Compressed Sensing Analysis",
    "summary": "The MUSIC algorithm, with its extension for imaging sparse extended objects, is analyzed by compressed sensing (CS) techniques. The notion of restricted isometry property (RIP) and an upper bound on the restricted isometry constant (RIC) are employed to establish sufficient conditions for the exact localization by MUSIC with or without the presence of noise. In the noiseless case, the sufficient condition gives an upper bound on the numbers of random sampling and incident directions necessary for exact localization. In the noisy case, the sufficient condition assumes additionally an upper bound for the noise-to-object ratio in terms of the RIC and the condition number of objects. Rigorous comparison of performance between MUSIC and the CS minimization principle, Lasso, is given. In general, the MUSIC algorithm guarantees to recover, with high probability, scatterers with random sampling and incident directions and sufficiently high frequency. For the favorable imaging geometry where the scatterers are distributed on a transverse plane MUSIC guarantees to recover, with high probability, scatterers with a median frequency and random sampling/incident directions. Numerical results confirm that the Lasso outperforms MUSIC in the well-resolved case while the opposite is true for the under-resolved case. The latter effect indicates the superresolution capability of the MUSIC algorithm. Another advantage of MUSIC over the Lasso as applied to imaging is the former's flexibility with grid spacing and guarantee of approximate localization of sufficiently separated objects in an arbitrarily fine grid. The error can be bounded from above by for general configurations and for objects distributed in a transverse plane."

    "summary": "We consider a multi-cell MIMO downlink (network MIMO) where base-stations (BS) with antennas connected to a central station (CS) serve single-antenna user terminals (UT). Although many works have shown the potential benefits of network MIMO, the conclusion critically depends on the underlying assumptions such as channel state information at transmitters (CSIT) and backhaul links. In this paper, by focusing on the impact of partial CSIT, we propose an outage-efficient strategy. Namely, with side information of all UT's messages and local CSIT, each BS applies zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming in a distributed manner. For a small number of UTs ( ), the ZF beamforming creates parallel MISO channels. Based on the statistical knowledge of these parallel channels, the CS performs a robust power allocation that simultaneously minimizes the outage probability of all UTs and achieves a diversity gain of per UT. With a large number of UTs ( ), we propose a so-called distributed diversity scheduling (DDS) scheme to select a subset of UTs with limited backhaul communication. It is proved that DDS achieves a diversity gain of , which scales optimally with the number of cooperative BSs as well as UTs. Numerical results confirm that even under realistic assumptions such as partial CSIT and limited backhaul communications, network MIMO can offer high data rates with a sufficient reliability to individual UTs."

We construct correlatively sparse Lagrange multiplier expressions (CS-LMEs) and propose CS-LME reformulations for polynomial optimization problems using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions. Correlatively sparse sum-of-squares (CS-SOS) relaxations are applied to solve the CS-LME reformulation. We show that the CS-LME reformulation inherits the original correlative sparsity pattern, and the CS-SOS relaxation provides sharper lower bounds when applied to the CS-LME reformulation, compared with when it is applied to the original problem. Moreover, the convergence of our approach is guaranteed under mild conditions. In numerical experiments, our new approach usually finds the global optimal value (up to a negligible error) with a low relaxation order for cases where directly solving the problem fails to get an accurate approximation. Also, by properly exploiting the correlative sparsity, our CS-LME approach requires less computational time than the original LME approach to reach the same accuracy level."

In this paper we study the potential of using reinforcement learning (RL) in order to synthesize quantum circuits, while optimizing the T-count and CS-count, of unitaries that are exactly implementable by the Clifford+T and Clifford+CS gate sets, respectively. In general, the complexity of existing algorithms depend exponentially on the number of qubits and the non-Clifford-count of unitaries. We have designed our RL framework to work with channel representation of unitaries, that enables us to perform matrix operations efficiently, using integers only. We have also incorporated pruning heuristics and a canonicalization of operators, in order to reduce the search complexity. As a result, compared to previous works, we are able to implement significantly larger unitaries, in less time, with much better success rate and improvement factor. Our results for Clifford+T synthesis on two qubits achieve close-to-optimal decompositions for up to 100 T gates, 5 times more than previous RL algorithms and to the best of our knowledge, the largest instances achieved with any method to date. Our RL algorithm is able to recover previously-known optimal linear complexity algorithm for T-count-optimal decomposition of 1 qubit unitaries. For 2-qubit Clifford+CS unitaries, our algorithm achieves a linear complexity, something that could only be accomplished by a previous algorithm using representation."

A dedicated experiment using the advanced technical installations of GSI, Darmstadt, permitted to realize ideal conditions for the investigation of relaxation effects in the meta-stable well. Combined with a highly sensitive experimental signature, it provides a measure of the transient effects with respect to the flux over the fission barrier. Within a two-step reaction process, 45 proton-rich unstable spherical isotopes produced by projectile-fragmentation of a stable 238U beam have been used as secondary projectiles. The fragmentation of the radioactive projectiles on lead results in nearly spherical compound nuclei which span a wide range in excitation energy and fissility. The decay of these excited systems by fission is studied with a dedicated set-up which permits the detection of both fission products in coincidence and the determination of their atomic numbers with high resolution. The width of the fission-fragment nuclear charge distribution is shown to be specifically sensitive to pre-saddle transient effects and is used to establish a clock for the passage of the saddle point. The comparison of the experimental results with model calculations points to a fission delay of (3.3+/-0.7).10-21s for initially spherical compound nuclei, independent of excitation energy and fissility. This value suggests a nuclear dissipation strength at small deformation of (4.5+/-0.5).1021s-1.

Subsequently, we evaluate several quantifiable author rebuttal strategies and their effects on review scores. These strategies can help authors in improving their review scores. Finally, we used machine learning models to predict rebuttal success and validated the impact of potential factors analyzed in this paper. Our experiments demonstrate that the utilization of all features proposed in this study can aid in predicting the success of the rebuttal.

It captures temporal dynamics of EEG which then serves as input to the proposed local and global graph-filtering layers. Using a defined neurophysiologically meaningful set of local and global graphs, LGGNet models the complex relations within and among functional areas of the brain. Under the robust nested cross-validation settings, the proposed method is evaluated on three publicly available datasets for four types of cognitive classification tasks, namely, the attention, fatigue, emotion, and preference classification tasks. LGGNet is compared with state-of-the-art methods, such as DeepConvNet, EEGNet, R2G-STNN, TSception, RGNN, AMCNN-DGCN, HRNN and GraphNet. The results show that LGGNet outperforms these methods, and the improvements are statistically significant (p<0.05) in most cases. The results show that bringing neuroscience prior knowledge into neural network design yields an improvement of classification performance.

    "title": "Efficient Adaptive Compressive Sensing Using Sparse Hierarchical Learned Dictionaries",
    "summary": "Recent breakthrough results in compressed sensing (CS) have established that many high dimensional objects can be accurately recovered from a relatively small number of non- adaptive linear projection observations, provided that the objects possess a sparse representation in some basis. Subsequent efforts have shown that the performance of CS can be improved by exploiting the structure in the location of the non-zero signal coefficients (structured sparsity) or using some form of online measurement focusing (adaptivity) in the sensing process. In this paper we examine a powerful hybrid of these two techniques. First, we describe a simple adaptive sensing procedure and show that it is a provably effective method for acquiring sparse signals that exhibit structured sparsity characterized by tree-based coefficient dependencies. Next, employing techniques from sparse hierarchical dictionary learning, we show that representations exhibiting the appropriate form of structured sparsity can be learned from collections of training data. The combination of these techniques results in an effective and efficient adaptive compressive acquisition procedure."

    "summary": "This letter presents an adaptive spectrum sensing algorithm that detects wideband spectrum using sub-Nyquist sampling rates. By taking advantage of compressed sensing (CS), the proposed algorithm reconstructs the wideband spectrum from compressed samples. Furthermore, an l2 norm validation approach is proposed that enables cognitive radios (CRs) to automatically terminate the signal acquisition once the current spectral recovery is satisfactory, leading to enhanced CR throughput. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can not only shorten the spectrum sensing interval, but also improve the throughput of wideband CRs."

    "title": "Dual-space Compressed Sensing",
    "summary": "Compressed sensing (CS) is a powerful method routinely employed to accelerate image acquisition. It is particularly suited to situations when the image under consideration is sparse but can be sampled in a basis where it is non-sparse. Here we propose an alternate CS regime in situations where the image can be sampled in two incoherent spaces simultaneously, with a special focus on image sampling in Fourier reciprocal spaces (e.g. real-space and k-space). Information is fed-forward from one space to the other, allowing new opportunities to efficiently solve the optimization problem at the heart of CS image reconstruction. We show that considerable gains in imaging acceleration are then possible over conventional CS. The technique provides enhanced robustness to noise, and is well suited to edge-detection problems. We envision applications for imaging collections of nanodiamond (ND) particles targeting specific regions in a volume of interest, exploiting the ability of lattice defects (NV centers) to allow ND particles to be imaged in reciprocal spaces simultaneously via optical fluorescence and 13C magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) respectively. Broadly this work suggests the potential to interface CS principles with hybrid sampling strategies to yield speedup in signal acquisition in many practical settings."

    "title": "Gambling-Based Confidence Sequences for Bounded Random Vectors",
    "summary": "A confidence sequence (CS) is a sequence of confidence sets that contains a target parameter of an underlying stochastic process at any time step with high probability. This paper proposes a new approach to constructing CSs for means of bounded multivariate stochastic processes using a general gambling framework, extending the recently established coin toss framework for bounded random processes. The proposed gambling framework provides a general recipe for constructing CSs for categorical and probability-vector-valued observations, as well as for general bounded multidimensional observations through a simple reduction. This paper specifically explores the use of the mixture portfolio, akin to Cover's universal portfolio, in the proposed framework and investigates the properties of the resulting CSs. Simulations demonstrate the tightness of these confidence sequences compared to existing methods. When applied to the sampling without-replacement setting for finite categorical data, it is shown that the resulting CS based on a universal gambling strategy is provably tighter than that of the posterior-prior ratio martingale proposed by Waudby-Smith and Ramdas."

    "summary": "In this paper, we investigate the geodesic motion and scalar perturbations of the Ayón-Beato-García (ABG) black hole (BH) coupled with a cloud of strings (CS). By employing the effective potential approach, we analyze the trajectories of massless and massive test particles around this regular BH solution. The interplay between nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) and CS significantly modifies the spacetime geometry, resulting in distinct dynamical properties for test particles. The behavior of null and timelike geodesics, including their stability and escape conditions, is thoroughly examined. In addition to the geodesic analysis, we study scalar perturbations by deriving the Klein-Gordon equation for massless scalar fields in this spacetime. The resulting Schrödinger-like wave equation reveals an effective potential that depends intricately on the NLED and CS parameters. Furthermore, we compute the greybody factors (GFs) to explore the energy transmission and absorption properties of theBH. Our results demonstrate that the NLED parameter and the CS parameter play pivotal roles in modulating the GFs, influencing the energy spectrum of scalar radiation. These results provide significant understanding of the observational characteristics of the ABG NLED-CS BH in astrophysical contexts."

    "summary": "Answer-Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful and expressive knowledge representation paradigm with a significant number of applications in logic-based AI. The traditional ground-and-solve approach, however, requires ASP programs to be grounded upfront and thus suffers from the so-called grounding bottleneck (i.e., ASP programs easily exhaust all available memory and thus become unsolvable). As a remedy, lazy-grounding ASP solvers have been developed, but many state-of-the-art techniques for grounded ASP solving have not been available to them yet. In this work we present, for the first time, adaptions to the lazy-grounding setting for many important techniques, like restarts, phase saving, domain-independent heuristics, and learned-clause deletion. Furthermore, we investigate their effects and in general observe a large improvement in solving capabilities and also uncover negative effects in certain cases, indicating the need for portfolio solving as known from other solvers.

Of greatest consideration is the characterization of the Chebyshev set (CS) which is a subset of a normed linear space (NLS) which contains unique BAs. However, a fundamental question remains unsolved to-date regarding the convexity of the CS in infinite NLS known as the CS problem. The question which has not been answered is: Is every CS in a NLS convex?. This question has not got any solution including the simplest form of a real Hilbert space (HS). In this note, we characterize CSs and convexity in NLSs. In particular, we consider the space of all real-valued norm-attainable functions. We show that CSs of the space of all real-valued norm-attainable functions are convex when they are closed, rotund and admits both Gateaux and Fréchet differentiability conditions."

    "title": "Topological interactions in broken gauge theories",
    "summary": "This thesis deals with planar gauge theories in which some gauge group G is spontaneously broken to a finite subgroup H. The spectrum consists of magnetic vortices, global H charges and dyonic combinations exhibiting topological Aharonov-Bohm interactions. Among other things, we review the Hopf algebra D(H) related to this residual discrete H gauge theory, which provides an unified description of the spin, braid and fusion properties of the aforementioned particles. The implications of adding a Chern-Simons (CS) term to these models are also addressed. We recall that the CS actions for a compact gauge group G are classified by the cohomology group H^4(BG,Z). For finite groups H this classification boils down to the cohomology group H^3(H,U(1)). Thus the different CS actions for a finite group H are given by the inequivalent 3-cocycles of H. It is argued that adding a CS action for the broken gauge group G leads to additional topological interactions for the vortices governed by a 3-cocycle for the residual finite gauge group H determined by a natural homomorphism from H^4(BG,Z) to H^3(H,U(1)). Accordingly, the related Hopf algebra D(H) is deformed into a quasi-Hopf algebra. These general considerations are illustrated by CS theories in which the direct product of some U(1) gauge groups is broken to a finite subgroup H. It turns out that not all conceivable 3-cocycles for finite abelian gauge groups H can be obtained in this way. Those that are not reached are the most interesting. A Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 CS theory given by such a 3-cocycle, for instance, is dual to an ordinary gauge theory with nonabelian gauge group the dihedral group of order eight. Finally, the CS theories with nonabelian finite gauge group a dihedral or double dihedral group are also discussed in full detail."

    "summary": "The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is an exact statement that connects via the axial anomaly the electric current in a system consisting of interacting fermions and gauge field with chirality imbalance that is put into a strong external magnetic field. Experimental search of the magnetically induced current in QCD in heavy ion collisions above a pseudocritical temperature hints, though not yet conclusive, that the induced current is either small or vanishing. This would imply that the chirality imbalance in QCD above that could be generated via topological fluctuations is at most very small. Here we present the most general reason for absence (smallness) of the chirality imbalance in QCD above Tc. It was recently found on the lattice that QCD above Tc is approximately chiral spin (CS) symmetric with the symmetry breaking at the level of a few percent. The CS transformations mix the right- and left-handed components of quarks. Then an exact CS symmetry would require absence of any chirality imbalance. Consequently an approximate CS symmetry admits at most a very small chirality imbalance in QCD above Tc. Hence the absence or smallness of an magnetically induced current observed in heavy ion collisions could be considered as experimental evidence for emergence of the CS symmetry above Tc."

Materials and Methods: Accelerated iMRI was performed during brain surgery using dual surface coils positioned around the area of resection. A deep learning (DL) model was trained on the fastMRI neuro dataset to mimic the data from the iMRI protocol. Evaluation was performed on imaging material from 40 patients imaged between 01.11.2021 - 01.06.2023 that underwent iMRI during tumor resection surgery. A comparative analysis was conducted between the conventional compressed sense (CS) method and the trained DL reconstruction method. Blinded evaluation of multiple image quality metrics was performed by two working neuro-radiologists and a working neurosurgeon on a 1 to 5 Likert scale (1=non diagnostic, 2=poor, 3=acceptable, 4=good, 5=excellent), and the favored reconstruction variant. Results: The DL reconstruction was strongly favored or favored over the CS reconstruction for 33/40, 39/40, and 8/40 of cases for reader 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Two of three readers consistently assigned higher ratings for the DL reconstructions, and the DL reconstructions had a higher score than their respective CS counterparts for 72%, 72%, and 14% of the cases for reader 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Still, the DL reconstructions exhibited shortcomings such as a striping artifact and reduced signal. Conclusion: DL shows promise to allow for high-quality reconstructions of intraoperative MRI with equal to or improved perceived spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, diagnostic confidence, diagnostic conspicuity, and spatial resolution compared to compressed sense."

    "title": "Online Wideband Spectrum Sensing Using Sparsity",
    "summary": "Wideband spectrum sensing is an essential part of cognitive radio systems. Exact spectrum estimation is usually inefficient as it requires sampling rates at or above the Nyquist rate. Using prior information on the structure of the signal could allow near exact reconstruction at much lower sampling rates. Sparsity of the sampled signal in the frequency domain is one of the popular priors studied for cognitive radio applications. Reconstruction of signals under sparsity assumptions has been studied rigorously by researchers in the field of Compressed Sensing (CS). CS algorithms that operate on batches of samples are known to be robust but can be computationally costly, making them unsuitable for cheap low power cognitive radio devices that require spectrum sensing in real time. On the other hand, on line algorithms that are based on variations of the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm have very simple updates so they are computationally efficient and can easily adapt in real time to changes of the underlying spectrum. In this paper we will present two variations of the LMS algorithm that enforce sparsity in the estimated spectrum given an upper bound on the number of non-zero coefficients. Assuming that the number of non-zero elements in the spectrum is known we show that under conditions the hard threshold operation can only reduce the error of our estimation. We will also show that we can estimate the number of non-zero elements of the spectrum at each iteration based on our online estimations. Finally, we numerically compare our algorithm with other on line sparsity-inducing algorithms in the literature."

By following and suitably modifying the approach of BGHP, in this article we construct a novel class of spin CS models which exhibit multi-parameter deformed or `nonstandard' variants of Yangian symmetry. An interesting feature of such CS Hamiltonians is that they contain many-body spin dependent interactions, which can be calculated directly from the associated rational solutions of Yang-Baxter equation. Moreover, these spin dependent interactions often lead to `anyon like' representations of permutation algebra on the combined internal space of all particles. We also find out the general forms of conserved quantities as well as Lax pairs for the above mentioned class of spin CS models, and describe the method of constructing their exact wave functions."

Intuitively, transfer learning is more effective when pre-training is on the in-domain datasets. A recent study by NASA has demonstrated that the microstructure segmentation with encoder-decoder algorithms benefits more from CNN encoders pre-trained on microscopy images than from those pre-trained on natural images. However, CNN models only capture the local spatial relations in images. In recent years, attention networks such as Transformers are increasingly used in image analysis to capture the long-range relations between pixels. In this study, we compare the segmentation performance of Transformer and CNN models pre-trained on microscopy images with those pre-trained on natural images. Our result partially confirms the NASA study that the segmentation performance of out-of-distribution images (taken under different imaging and sample conditions) is significantly improved when pre-training on microscopy images. However, the performance gain for one-shot and few-shot learning is more modest with Transformers. We also find that for image segmentation, the combination of pre-trained Transformers and CNN encoders are consistently better than pre-trained CNN encoders alone. Our dataset (of about 50,000 images) combines the public portion of the NASA dataset with additional images we collected. Even with much less training data, our pre-trained models have significantly better performance for image segmentation. This result suggests that Transformers and CNN complement each other and when pre-trained on microscopy images, they are more beneficial to the downstream tasks."

Although their combination is quite promising to meet these requirements, it may not work as desired. It is mainly because the regularization effect of KD further diminishes the already reduced representation power of a quantized model. To address this short-coming, we propose Quantization-aware Knowledge Distillation (QKD) wherein quantization and KD are care-fully coordinated in three phases. First, Self-studying (SS) phase fine-tunes a quantized low-precision student network without KD to obtain a good initialization. Second, Co-studying (CS) phase tries to train a teacher to make it more quantizaion-friendly and powerful than a fixed teacher. Finally, Tutoring (TU) phase transfers knowledge from the trained teacher to the student. We extensively evaluate our method on ImageNet and CIFAR-10/100 datasets and show an ablation study on networks with both standard and depthwise-separable convolutions. The proposed QKD outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 1.3% improvement on ResNet-18 with W4A4, 2.6% on MobileNetV2 with W4A4). Additionally, QKD could recover the full-precision accuracy at as low as W3A3 quantization on ResNet and W6A6 quantization on MobilenetV2."

This paper aims to efficiently exploit the inherent sparsity of echo signals for the multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based ISAC system. A novel joint receive echo processing and transmit beamforming design is presented to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first propose a compressive sensing (CS)-assisted estimation approach to facilitate ISAC receive echo processing, which can not only enable accurate recovery of target information, but also allow substantial reduction in the number of sensing subcarriers to be sampled and processed. Then, based on the proposed CS-assisted processing method, the associated transmit beamforming design is formulated with the objective of maximizing the sum-rate of multiuser communications while satisfying the transmit power budget and ensuring the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the designated sensing subcarriers. In order to address the formulated non-convex problem involving high-dimensional variables, an effective iterative algorithm employing majorization minimization (MM), fractional programming (FP), and the nonlinear equality alternative direction method of multipliers (neADMM) with closed-form solutions has been developed.

    "summary": "Sparse signals are encountered in a broad range of applications. In order to process these signals using digital hardware, they must be first sampled and quantized using an analog-to-digital convertor (ADC), which typically operates in a serial scalar manner. In this work, we propose a method for serial quantization of sparse time sequences (SQuaTS) inspired by group testing theory, which is designed to reliably and accurately quantize sparse signals acquired in a sequential manner using serial scalar ADCs. Unlike previously proposed approaches which combine quantization and compressed sensing (CS), our SQuaTS scheme updates its representation on each incoming analog sample and does not require the complete signal to be observed and stored in analog prior to quantization. We characterize the asymptotic tradeoff between accuracy and quantization rate of SQuaTS as well as its computational burden. We also propose a variation of SQuaTS, which trades rate for computational efficiency. Next, we show how SQuaTS can be naturally extended to distributed quantization scenarios, where a set of jointly sparse time sequences are acquired individually and processed jointly. Our numerical results demonstrate that SQuaTS is capable of achieving substantially improved representation accuracy over previous CS-based schemes without requiring the complete set of analog signal samples to be observed prior to its quantization, making it an attractive approach for acquiring sparse time sequences."

We compute all the correlation functions of our anyon fields and study an anyonic W-algebra of unbounded operators with a common dense domain. This algebra contains an operator with peculiar exchange relations with the anyon fields. This operator can be interpreted as a second quantised Calogero-Sutherland (CS) Hamiltonian and may be used to solve the CS model. In particular, we inductively construct all eigenfunctions of the CS model from anyon correlation functions, for all particle numbers and positive couplings."

    "title": "Recursions Are All You Need: Towards Efficient Deep Unfolding Networks",
    "summary": "The use of deep unfolding networks in compressive sensing (CS) has seen wide success as they provide both simplicity and interpretability. However, since most deep unfolding networks are iterative, this incurs significant redundancies in the network. In this work, we propose a novel recursion-based framework to enhance the efficiency of deep unfolding models. First, recursions are used to effectively eliminate the redundancies in deep unfolding networks. Secondly, we randomize the number of recursions during training to decrease the overall training time. Finally, to effectively utilize the power of recursions, we introduce a learnable unit to modulate the features of the model based on both the total number of iterations and the current iteration index. To evaluate the proposed framework, we apply it to both ISTA-Net+ and COAST. Extensive testing shows that our proposed framework allows the network to cut down as much as 75% of its learnable parameters while mostly maintaining its performance, and at the same time, it cuts around 21% and 42% from the training time for ISTA-Net+ and COAST respectively. Moreover, when presented with a limited training dataset, the recursive models match or even outperform their respective non-recursive baseline. Codes and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/Rawwad-Alhejaili/Recursions-Are-All-You-Need ."

    "summary": "We report on an element-selective study of the fate of charge carriers in photoexcited inorganic CsPbBr3 and CsPb(ClBr)3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) in toluene solutions using time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy with 80 ps time resolution. Probing the Br K-edge, the Pb L3-edge and the Cs L2-edge, we find that holes in the valence band are localized at Br atoms, forming small polarons, while electrons appear as delocalized in the conduction band. No signature of either electronic or structural changes are observed at the Cs L2-edge. The results at the Br and Pb edges suggest the existence of a weakly localized exciton, while the absence of signatures at the Cs edge indicates that the Cs+ cation plays no role in the charge transport, at least beyond 80 ps. These results can explain the rather modest charge carrier mobilities in these materials."

    "summary": "This study investigates the impact of monochromatic lighting on visual acuity (VA) and contrast sensitivity (CS). Traditional assessments of VA and CS are typically conducted under the illumination of ``white'' light, but variations in color temperature can influence outcomes. Utilizing data from an exhibition by Olafur Eliasson, where a room was illuminated with low-pressure sodium lamps, creating an almost monochromatic yellow light, we compared visual assessments in the yellow room with conventional lighting in a white room. For VA, the results show no significant differences between the two lighting conditions, while for CS, a more nuanced situation is observed. The bias in CS measurements is clinically relevant, and the p-value suggests that further investigation with a larger, more diverse sample may be worthwhile. Despite limitations, such as higher illumination conditions than standard protocols, the unique ``laboratory'' offered by the exhibition facilitated measurements not easily achievable in a traditional setting."

We introduce a novel approach to create accurate, sparse foundational versions of performant LLMs that achieve full accuracy recovery for fine-tuning tasks at up to 70% sparsity. We achieve this for the LLaMA-2 7B model by combining the SparseGPT one-shot pruning method and sparse pretraining of those models on a subset of the SlimPajama dataset mixed with a Python subset of The Stack dataset. We exhibit training acceleration due to sparsity on Cerebras CS-3 chips that closely matches theoretical scaling. In addition, we establish inference acceleration of up to 3x on CPUs by utilizing Neural Magic's DeepSparse engine and 1.7x on GPUs through Neural Magic's nm-vllm engine. The above gains are realized via sparsity alone, thus enabling further gains through additional use of quantization. Specifically, we show a total speedup on CPUs for sparse-quantized LLaMA models of up to 8.6x. We demonstrate these results across diverse, challenging tasks, including chat, instruction following, code generation, arithmetic reasoning, and summarization to prove their generality. This work paves the way for rapidly creating smaller and faster LLMs without sacrificing accuracy."

For that propose, we used the, symplectically invariant, semiclassical Weyl propagator obtained by performing a stationary phase approximation (SPA) for the path integral in the Weyl representation. After what, for the transformation to CS representation SPA is avoided, instead a quadratic expansion of the complex exponent is used. This procedure also allows to express the semiclassical CS propagator uniquely in terms of the classical evolution of the initial point, without the need of any root search typical of Van Vleck Gutzwiller based propagators. For the case of chaotic Hamiltonian systems, the explicit time dependence of the CS propagator has been obtained. The comparison with a realistic chaotic system that derives from a quadratic Hamiltonian, the cat map, reveals that the expression here derived is exact up to quadratic Hamiltonian systems."

    "summary": "Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance graph neural networks' (GNNs) ability to learn rich representations from unlabeled graph-structured data. However, current GCL models face challenges with computational demands and limited feature utilization, often relying only on basic graph properties like node degrees and edge attributes. This constrains their capacity to fully capture the complex topological characteristics of real-world phenomena represented by graphs. To address these limitations, we propose Tensor-Fused Multi-View Graph Contrastive Learning (TensorMV-GCL), a novel framework that integrates extended persistent homology (EPH) with GCL representations and facilitates multi-scale feature extraction. Our approach uniquely employs tensor aggregation and compression to fuse information from graph and topological features obtained from multiple augmented views of the same graph. By incorporating tensor concatenation and contraction modules, we reduce computational overhead by separating feature tensor aggregation and transformation. Furthermore, we enhance the quality of learned topological features and model robustness through noise-injected EPH. Experiments on molecular, bioinformatic, and social network datasets demonstrate TensorMV-GCL's superiority, outperforming 15 state-of-the-art methods in graph classification tasks across 9 out of 11 benchmarks while achieving comparable results on the remaining two.

When the heart can't pump enough blood to efficiently deliver nutrients and oxygen to the body, kidney function may be impaired, resulting in fluid retention. CHF patients require a broad drug regimen to maintain the delicate system balance, particularly between their heart and kidneys. These drugs include ACE inhibitors and Beta Blockers to control blood pressure, anticoagulants to prevent blood clots, and diuretics to reduce fluid overload. Many of these drugs may interact, and potential effects of these interactions must be weighed against their benefits. For this project, we consider a set of 44 drugs identified as specifically relevant for treating CHF by pediatric cardiologists at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. This list was generated as part of our current work at the LPCH Heart Center. The goal of this project is to identify and evaluate potentially harmful drug-drug interactions (DDIs) within pediatric patients with Congestive Heart Failure. This identification will be done autonomously, so that it may continuously update by evaluating newly published literature."

We introduce an regularized formulation of CS which we reformulate as a mixed integer second order cone program. We derive a second order cone relaxation of this problem and show that under mild conditions on the regularization parameter, the resulting relaxation is equivalent to the well studied basis pursuit denoising problem. We present a semidefinite relaxation that strengthens the second order cone relaxation and develop a custom branch-and-bound algorithm that leverages our second order cone relaxation to solve small-scale instances of CS to certifiable optimality. When compared against solutions produced by three state of the art benchmark methods on synthetic data, our numerical results show that our approach produces solutions that are on average more sparse. When compared only against the experiment-wise best performing benchmark method on synthetic data, our approach produces solutions that are on average more sparse. On real world ECG data, for a given reconstruction error our approach produces solutions that are on average more sparse than benchmark methods ( more sparse if only compared against the best performing benchmark), while for a given sparsity level our approach produces solutions that have on average lower reconstruction error than benchmark methods ( lower error if only compared against the best performing benchmark). When used as a component of a multi-label classification algorithm, our approach achieves greater classification accuracy than benchmark compressed sensing methods. This improved accuracy comes at the cost of an increase in computation time by several orders of magnitude."

Currently, CS favors incoherent systems, in which any two measurements are as little correlated as possible. In reality, however, many problems are coherent, and conventional methods such as minimization do not work well. Recently, the difference of the and norms, denoted as - , is shown to have superior performance over the classic method, but it is computationally expensive. We derive an analytical solution for the proximal operator of the - metric, and it makes some fast solvers such as forward-backward splitting (FBS) and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) applicable for - . We describe in details how to incorporate the proximal operator into FBS and ADMM and show that the resulting algorithms are convergent under mild conditions. Both algorithms are shown to be much more efficient than the original implementation of - based on a difference-of-convex approach in the numerical experiments."

We aim to characterize the distribution and abundance of molecules in the disk of DG Tau. In the context of the ALMA chemical survey of Disk-Outflow sources in Taurus (ALMA-DOT) we analyse ALMA observations of the disk of DG Tau in H2CO 3(1,2)-2(1,1), CS 5-4, and CN 2-1 at ~0.15\", i.e. ~18 au at 121 pc. H2CO and CS originate from a disk ring at the edge of the 1.3mm dust continuum, with CS probing an outer disk region with respect to H2CO (peaking at ~70 and ~60 au, respectively). CN originates from an outermost disk/envelope region peaking at ~80 au. H2CO is dominated by disk emission, while CS probes also two streams of material possibly accreting onto the disk with a peak of emission where the stream connects to the disk. The ring- and disk-height- averaged column densities are ~2.4-8.6e13 cm-2 (H2CO), ~1.7-2.5e13 cm-2 (CS), and ~1.9-4.7e13 cm-2 (CN). Unsharp masking reveals a ring of enhanced dust emission at ~40 au, i.e. just outside the CO snowline (~30 au). CS and H2CO emissions are co-spatial suggesting that they are chemically linked. The observed rings of molecular emission at the edge of the 1.3mm continuum may be due to dust opacity effects and/or continnum over-subtraction in the inner disk; as well as to increased UV penetration and/or temperature inversion at the edge of the mm-dust which would cause an enhanced gas-phase formation and desorption of these molecules. Moreover, H2CO and CS originate from outside the ring of enhanced dust emission, which also coincides with a change of the linear polarization at 0.87mm. This suggests that outside the CO snowline there could be a change of the dust properties which would reflect in the increase of the intensity (and change of polarization) of continuum, and of molecular emission."

Replacement of the CS expression with an alternative dramatically affects predicted phase behaviour and, for polydisperse colloid, the resultant fractionation predictions. Although short-range attractions render FVAO, as a perturbative HS-based theory, less accurate anyway, we argue that the particular effects of CS in this regime are an important consideration -- usually ignored -- in the evaluation of such theories. We refer to a variety of literature exhibiting similarly inaccurate gas-liquid binodals, and suggest CS's status as the de facto choice of hard sphere reference should be carefully considered where short-range attractions are present."

    "summary": "Hybrid analog-digital (HAD) architecture is widely adopted in practical millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to reduce hardware cost and energy consumption. However, channel estimation in the context of HAD is challenging due to only limited radio frequency (RF) chains at transceivers. Although various compressive sensing (CS) algorithms have been developed to solve this problem by exploiting inherent channel sparsity and sparsity structures, practical effects, such as power leakage and beam squint, can still make the real channel features deviate from the assumed models and result in performance degradation. Also, the high complexity of CS algorithms caused by a large number of iterations hinders their applications in practice. To tackle these issues, we develop a deep learning (DL)-based channel estimation approach where the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm is unfolded into a deep neural network (DNN). In each SBL layer, Gaussian variance parameters of the sparse angular domain channel are updated by a tailored DNN, which is able to effectively capture complicated channel sparsity structures in various domains. Besides, the measurement matrix is jointly optimized for performance improvement. Then, the proposed approach is extended to the multi-block case where channel correlation in time is further exploited to adaptively predict the measurement matrix and facilitate the update of Gaussian variance parameters. Based on simulation results, the proposed approaches significantly outperform existing approaches but with reduced complexity."

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to evaluate the cine MRI with deep learning reconstruction for cardiac function analysis and compare it with other conventional methods. The cardiac functional values obtained from cine MRI with deep learning reconstruction are consistent with values from clinical standard retro-cine MRI."

A solution to SR is then a partition of the agents into pairs so that each pair shares a room, and there is no pair of agents that would block this matching (i.e., who prefers the other to their roommate in the matching). There are interesting variations of SR that are motivated by applications (e.g., the preference lists may be incomplete (SRI) and involve ties (SRTI)), and that try to find a more fair solution (e.g., Egalitarian SR). Unlike the Stable Marriage problem, every SR instance is not guaranteed to have a solution. For that reason, there are also variations of SR that try to find a good-enough solution (e.g., Almost SR). Most of these variations are NP-hard. We introduce a formal framework, called SRTI-ASP, utilizing the logic programming paradigm Answer Set Programming, that is provable and general enough to solve many of such variations of SR. Our empirical analysis shows that SRTI-ASP is also promising for applications. This paper is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP."

    "summary": "Abstract Purpose: High-quality 4D MRI requires an impractically long scanning time for dense k-space signal acquisition covering all respiratory phases. Accelerated sparse sampling followed by reconstruction enhancement is desired but often results in degraded image quality and long reconstruction time. We hereby propose the chained iterative reconstruction network (CIRNet) for efficient sparse-sampling reconstruction while maintaining clinically deployable quality. Methods: CIRNet adopts the denoising diffusion probabilistic framework to condition the image reconstruction through a stochastic iterative denoising process. During training, a forward Markovian diffusion process is designed to gradually add Gaussian noise to the densely sampled ground truth (GT), while CIRNet is optimized to iteratively reverse the Markovian process from the forward outputs. At the inference stage, CIRNet performs the reverse process solely to recover signals from noise, conditioned upon the undersampled input. CIRNet processed the 4D data (3D+t) as temporal slices (2D+t). The proposed framework is evaluated on a data cohort consisting of 48 patients (12332 temporal slices) who underwent free-breathing liver 4D MRI. 3-, 6-, 10-, 20- and 30-times acceleration were examined with a retrospective random undersampling scheme. Compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction with a spatiotemporal constraint and a recently proposed deep network, Re-Con-GAN, are selected as baselines. Results: CIRNet consistently achieved superior performance compared to CS and Re-Con-GAN. The inference time of CIRNet, CS, and Re-Con-GAN are 11s, 120s, and 0.15s. Conclusion: A novel framework, CIRNet, is presented. CIRNet maintains useable image quality for acceleration up to 30 times, significantly reducing the burden of 4DMRI."

The application to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the discrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry constraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra continuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian primitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing memory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a discretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by encoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us to link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity transformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the computational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the discrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete representation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints ( Eikonal loss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and enforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based consistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher relighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding complex manually designed optimization. The experiments reveal that our method outperforms existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/NK-CS-ZZL/DiscretizedSDF."

The ISACL incorporates the CL strategy to enhance the performance of ISA and avoid the trapping in the local optima. By this methodology, it is intended to train the neural network by tuning its parameters to optimal values and thus achieving high-accuracy level regarding forecasted results. The ISACL-MFNN model is investigated on the official data of the COVID-19 reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) to analyze the confirmed cases for the upcoming days. The performance regarding the proposed forecasting model is validated and assessed by introducing some indices including the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the comparisons with other optimization algorithms are presented.

    "summary": "Beam alignment is key in enabling millimeter wave and terahertz radios to achieve their capacity. Due to the use of large arrays in these systems, the common exhaustive beam scanning results in a substantial training overhead. Prior work has addressed this issue, by developing compressive sensing (CS)-based methods which exploit channel sparsity to achieve faster beam alignment. Unfortunately, standard CS techniques employ wide beams and suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the channel measurements. To solve this challenge, we develop an IEEE 802.11ad/ay compatible technique that takes an in-sector approach for CS. In our method, the angle domain channel is partitioned into several sectors, and the channel within the best sector is estimated for beam alignment. The essence of our framework lies in the construction of a low-resolution beam codebook to identify the best sector and in the design of the CS matrix for in-sector channel estimation. Our beam codebook illuminates distinct non-overlapping sectors and can be realized with low-resolution phased arrays. We show that the proposed codebook results in a higher received SNR than the state-of-the-art sector sweep codebooks. Furthermore, our optimized CS matrix achieves a better in-sector channel reconstruction than comparable benchmarks."

    "title": "Onset of magnetic reconnection in a collisionless, high-beta plasma",
    "summary": "In a magnetized, collisionless plasma, the magnetic moment of the constituent particles is an adiabatic invariant. An increase in the magnetic-field strength in such a plasma thus leads to an increase in the thermal pressure perpendicular to the field lines. Above a -dependent threshold (where is the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure), this pressure anisotropy drives the mirror instability, producing strong distortions in the field lines on ion-Larmor scales. The impact of this instability on magnetic reconnection is investigated using a simple analytical model for the formation of a current sheet (CS) and the associated production of pressure anisotropy. The difficulty in maintaining an isotropic, Maxwellian particle distribution during the formation and subsequent thinning of a CS in a collisionless plasma, coupled with the low threshold for the mirror instability in a high- plasma, imply that the geometry of reconnecting magnetic fields can differ radically from the standard Harris-sheet profile often used in simulations of collisionless reconnection. As a result, depending on the rate of CS formation and the initial CS thickness, tearing modes whose growth rates and wavenumbers are boosted by this difference may disrupt the mirror-infested CS before standard tearing modes can develop. A quantitative theory is developed to illustrate this process, which may find application in the tearing-mediated disruption of kinetic magnetorotational \"channel\" modes."

    "summary": "We propose a simple model for the bolometric light curve of type Ia supernova exploding in a dense circumstellar (CS) envelope to describe the light curves of supernovae 2002ic and 1997cy. The modeling shows that at the radius cm the density of CS envelopes around both supernovae is similar. The mass of the CS envelope around SN 1997cy is close to , while the characteristic time of the ejection of this envelope does not exceed 600 yr. We analyze two possible evolutionary scenarios which might lead to the explosion of type Ia supernova inside a dense CS envelope: accretion on CO white dwarf in the symbiotic binary and evolution of a single star with the initial mass of about . If the conjecture about the explosion of type Ia supernova in a dense CS envelope is correct in the case of SN 2002ic and SN 1997cy then the rapid loss of the red supergiant envelope and the subsequent explosion of the CO white dwarf are synchronized by certain mechanism. This mechanism might be related to the contraction of the white dwarf as it approaches the Chandrasekhar limit. We show that formation of a (super)Chandrasekhar mass due to the merger of a CO white dwarf and CO core of a red supergiant with consequent explosion is unlikely, since it does not provide the required synchronization of the rapid mass loss and explosion."

    "summary": "This paper presents recent progress in the acoustic modelling of under-resourced code-switched (CS) speech in multiple South African languages. We consider two approaches. The first constructs separate bilingual acoustic models corresponding to language pairs (English-isiZulu, English-isiXhosa, English-Setswana and English-Sesotho). The second constructs a single unified five-lingual acoustic model representing all the languages (English, isiZulu, isiXhosa, Setswana and Sesotho). For these two approaches we consider the effectiveness of semi-supervised training to increase the size of the very sparse acoustic training sets. Using approximately 11 hours of untranscribed speech, we show that both approaches benefit from semi-supervised training. The bilingual TDNN-F acoustic models also benefit from the addition of CNN layers (CNN-TDNN-F), while the five-lingual system does not show any significant improvement. Furthermore, because English is common to all language pairs in our data, it dominates when training a unified language model, leading to improved English ASR performance at the expense of the other languages. Nevertheless, the five-lingual model offers flexibility because it can process more than two languages simultaneously, and is therefore an attractive option as an automatic transcription system in a semi-supervised training pipeline."

    "summary": "The spread of misinformation on social media platforms threatens democratic processes, contributes to massive economic losses, and endangers public health. Many efforts to address misinformation focus on a knowledge deficit model and propose interventions for improving users' critical thinking through access to facts. Such efforts are often hampered by challenges with scalability, and by platform users' personal biases. The emergence of generative AI presents promising opportunities for countering misinformation at scale across ideological barriers. In this paper, we introduce a framework (MisinfoEval) for generating and comprehensively evaluating large language model (LLM) based misinformation interventions. We present (1) an experiment with a simulated social media environment to measure effectiveness of misinformation interventions, and (2) a second experiment with personalized explanations tailored to the demographics and beliefs of users with the goal of countering misinformation by appealing to their pre-existing values. Our findings confirm that LLM-based interventions are highly effective at correcting user behavior (improving overall user accuracy at reliability labeling by up to 41.72%). Furthermore, we find that users favor more personalized interventions when making decisions about news reliability and users shown personalized interventions have significantly higher accuracy at identifying misinformation."

Recently, there have been some attempts towards a similar goal, e.g., studies on Conversational Agents (CAs) and Conversational Search (CS). However, they either do not address complex information needs, or they are limited to the development of conceptual frameworks and/or laboratory-based user studies. We pursue two goals in this paper: (1) the creation of a suitable dataset, the Search as a Conversation (SaaC) dataset, for the development of pipelines for conversations with search engines, and (2) the development of astate-of-the-art pipeline for conversations with search engines, the Conversations with Search Engines (CaSE), using this dataset. SaaC is built based on a multi-turn conversational search dataset, where we further employ workers from a crowdsourcing platform to summarize each relevant passage into a short, conversational response. CaSE enhances the state-of-the-art by introducing a supporting token identification module and aprior-aware pointer generator, which enables us to generate more accurate responses. We carry out experiments to show that CaSE is able to outperform strong baselines. We also conduct extensive analyses on the SaaC dataset to show where there is room for further improvement beyond CaSE. Finally, we release the SaaC dataset and the code for CaSE and all models used for comparison to facilitate future research on this topic."

    "summary": "Classical shadows (CS) have emerged as a powerful way to estimate many properties of quantum states based on random measurements and classical post-processing. In their original formulation, they come with optimal (or close to) sampling complexity guarantees for generic states and generic observables. Still, it is natural to expect to even further lower sampling requirements when equipped with a priori knowledge regarding either the underlying state or the observables. Here, we consider the case where such knowledge is provided in terms of symmetries of the unknown state or of the observables. Criterion and guidelines for symmetric shadows are provided. As a concrete example we focus on the case of permutation invariance (PI), and detail constructions of several families of PI-CSs. In particular, building on results obtained in the field of PI quantum tomography, we develop and study shallow PI-CS protocol. Benefits of these symmetric CS are demonstrated compared to established CS protocols showcasing vastly improved performances."

    "summary": "Given the potential for technology to inflict harm and injustice on society, it is imperative that we cultivate a sense of social responsibility among our students as they progress through the Computer Science (CS) curriculum. Our students need to be able to examine the social complexities in which technology development and use are situated. Also, aligning students' personal goals and their ability to achieve them in their field of study is important for promoting motivation and a sense of belonging. Promoting communal goals while learning computing can help broaden participation, particularly among groups who have been historically marginalized in computing. Keeping these considerations in mind, we piloted an introductory Java programming course in which activities engaging students in ethical and socially responsible considerations were integrated across modules. Rather than adding social on top of the technical content, our curricular approach seeks to weave them together. The data from the class suggests that the students found the inclusion of the social context in the technical assignments to be more motivating and expressed greater agency in realizing social change. We share our approach to designing this new introductory socially responsible computing course and the students' reflections. We also highlight seven considerations for educators seeking to incorporate socially responsible computing."

    "summary": "Computational imaging has been revolutionized by compressed sensing algorithms, which offer guaranteed uniqueness, convergence, and stability properties. Model-based deep learning methods that combine imaging physics with learned regularization priors have emerged as more powerful alternatives for image recovery. The main focus of this paper is to introduce a memory efficient model-based algorithm with similar theoretical guarantees as CS methods. The proposed iterative algorithm alternates between a gradient descent involving the score function and a conjugate gradient algorithm to encourage data consistency. The score function is modeled as a monotone convolutional neural network. Our analysis shows that the monotone constraint is necessary and sufficient to enforce the uniqueness of the fixed point in arbitrary inverse problems. In addition, it also guarantees the convergence to a fixed point, which is robust to input perturbations. We introduce two implementations of the proposed MOL framework, which differ in the way the monotone property is imposed. The first approach enforces a strict monotone constraint, while the second one relies on an approximation. The guarantees are not valid for the second approach in the strict sense. However, our empirical studies show that the convergence and robustness of both approaches are comparable, while the less constrained approximate implementation offers better performance. The proposed deep equilibrium formulation is significantly more memory efficient than unrolled methods, which allows us to apply it to 3D or 2D+time problems that current unrolled algorithms cannot handle."

    "title": "A Two-Stage Dimension Reduction Method for Induced Responses and Its Applications",
    "summary": "Researchers in the biological sciences nowadays often encounter the curse of high-dimensionality, which many previously developed statistical models fail to overcome. To tackle this problem, sufficient dimension reduction aims to estimate the central subspace (CS), in which all the necessary information supplied by the covariates regarding the response of interest is contained. Subsequent statistical analysis can then be made in a lower-dimensional space while preserving relevant information. Oftentimes studies are interested in a certain transformation of the response (the induced response), instead of the original one, whose corresponding CS may vary. When estimating the CS of the induced response, existing dimension reduction methods may, however, suffer the problem of inefficiency. In this article, we propose a more efficient two-stage estimation procedure to estimate the CS of an induced response. This approach is further extended to the case of censored responses. An application for combining multiple biomarkers is also illustrated. Simulation studies and two data examples provide further evidence of the usefulness of the proposed method."

The result for cores allows us to prove that the SI problem for induced -Path and -Cycle is harder than previously known. Previously [Floderus et al. Theor.

However, despite the potential benefits, it is unclear whether this approach is feasible, and if so, what the involved stakeholders-students, educators, and scientists-should expect from it. Can students perform a data analysis replication over the course of a class? What are the costs and benefits for educators? And how can this solution help benchmark and improve the state of science? In the present study, we incorporated data analysis replications in the project component of the Applied Data Analysis course (CS-401) taught at EPFL (N=354 students). Here we report pre-registered findings based on surveys administered throughout the course. First, we demonstrate that students can replicate previously published scientific papers, most of them qualitatively and some exactly. We find discrepancies between what students expect of data analysis replications and what they experience by doing them along with changes in expectations about reproducibility, which together serve as evidence of attitude shifts to foster students' critical thinking. Second, we provide information for educators about how much overhead is needed to incorporate replications into the classroom and identify concerns that replications bring as compared to more traditional assignments. Third, we identify tangible benefits of the in-class data analysis replications for scientific communities, such as a collection of replication reports and insights about replication barriers in scientific work that should be avoided going forward. Overall, we demonstrate that incorporating replication tasks into a large data science class can increase the reproducibility of scientific work as a by-product of data science instruction, thus benefiting both science and students."

Previous studies found that the core is gravitationally stable and shows signs of inward motion. Using the Owens Valley (OVRO) and Plateau de Bure (PdB) interferometers we obtained high-angular resolution maps of the core in the carbon monosulfide CS 2-1 and the cyanoacetylene HC3N 10-9 transitions. Together with CS 5-4, C34S 3-2, and bolometer data obtained with the IRAM 30m telescope, we analyse the excitation conditions and the structural properties of the cloud. On the one hand, the new CS 2-1 observations reveal significant substructure on a scale of about 7\", i.e., the beam size, corresponding to about 1050 AU at an adopted distance of 150pc. On the other hand, the interferometric observations in the HC3N 10-9 transition shows just one single well resolved clump in the inner part of the core. This core is well described by an intensity profile following from a centrally peaked volume density distribution. We find no evidence for depletion of CS onto dust grains. The inward motion seen in the CS 2-1 occurs one-sided from the middle of the filamentary cloud towards the HC3N core."

The simplest example of such a CS-brane coupling is a domain wall coupled to the electromagnetic CS three-form. This describes a topologically charged interface where the CS form AdA is supported, separating two three-dimensional spatial regions in 3+1 spacetime. Electrodynamics at either side of the brane is described by the same Maxwell's equations, but those two regions have different vacua, characterized by a different value of the θ-parameter multiplying the Pontryagin form F ^ F. The θ-term is the abelian version of the concept introduced by 't Hooft for the resolution of the U(1) problem in QCD. We point out that CS-generalized classical electrodynamics shows new phenomena when two neighboring regions with different θ-vacua are present. These topological effects result from surface effects induced by the boundary and we explore the consequences of such boundary effects for the propagation of the electromagnetic field in Maxwell theory. Several features, including optical and electrostatic/magnetostatic responses, which may be observable in condensed matter systems, like topological insulators, are discussed."

This variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets, including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in this domain."

However, the optimum properties of such CS materials are not well understood. In this context, through detailed analytical and numerical modeling, here we provide several interesting insights on the efficiency tradeoff with CS material properties. First, we show that perfect band alignment is a desirable feature only if the interface is devoid of any trap states. Otherwise, a band offset of around 0.2eV-0.4eV provides sufficient band bending to reduce the effect of interface recombination, thus improving the performance. Surprisingly, the interface passivation quality for the minority carrier extraction layer is found to be far less demanding than that for the majority carrier extraction layer. Additionally, doping density and dielectric constant of CS layers have a similar effect as band offset on solar cell performance. Our results have obvious implications toward the selection of appropriate materials as carrier selective layers and hence are of broad interest to the community."

However, the communication of large volume of electrophysiological signals between sensors and processing apparatus and related computation become two major bottlenecks for seizure prediction systems due to the constrained bandwidth and limited computation resource, especially for wearable and implantable medical devices. Although compressive sensing (CS) can be adopted to compress the signals to reduce communication bandwidth requirement, it needs a complex reconstruction procedure before the signal can be used for seizure prediction. In this paper, we propose C SP-Net, to jointly solve compression, prediction, and reconstruction with a single neural network. A plug-and-play in-sensor compression matrix is constructed to reduce transmission bandwidth requirement. The compressed signal can be used for seizure prediction without additional reconstruction steps. Reconstruction of the original signal can also be carried out in high fidelity. Prediction accuracy, sensitivity, false prediction rate, and reconstruction quality of the proposed framework are evaluated under various compression ratios. The experimental results illustrate that our model outperforms the competitive state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin in prediction accuracy. In particular, our proposed method produces an average loss of 0.35 % in prediction accuracy with a compression ratio ranging from 1/2 to 1/16."

This gives us a way to consistently define chiral symmetry (CS) for DTQW's. We show that CS can be ensured by using an \"inversion symmetric\" pulse sequence. For one-dimensional DTQW's with CS, we identify the bulk ZxZ topological invariant that controls the number of topologically protected 0 and pi energy edge states at the interfaces between different domains, and give simple formulas for these invariants. We illustrate this bulk--boundary correspondence for DTQW's on the example of the \"4-step quantum walk\", where tuning CS and particle-hole symmetry realizes edge states in various symmetry classes."

However, the boundary between these polymer-rich phases is quite broad and the associated changes in the polymer relaxation in the complexes across the transition regime are poorly understood. In this work, the relaxation dynamics of complexes across this transition is probed over a wide timescale by measuring viscoelastic spectra and zero-shear viscosities at varying temperatures and salt concentrations for two different salt types. We find that the complexes exhibit time-temperature superposition (TTS) at all salt concentrations, while the range of overlapped-frequencies for time-temperature-salt superposition (TTSS) strongly depends on the salt concentration (Cs) and gradually shifts to higher frequencies as Cs is decreased. The sticky-Rouse model describes the relaxation behavior at all Cs. However, collective relaxation of polyelectrolyte complexes gradually approaches a rubbery regime and eventually exhibits a gel-like response as Cs is decreased and limits the validity of TTSS."

To address this issue, we make the first attempt to perform textual reasoning based on visual semantics in this paper. Technically, given the character segmentation maps predicted by a VR model, we construct a subgraph for each instance, where nodes represent the pixels in it and edges are added between nodes based on their spatial similarity. Then, these subgraphs are sequentially connected by their root nodes and merged into a complete graph. Based on this graph, we devise a graph convolutional network for textual reasoning (GTR) by supervising it with a cross-entropy loss. GTR can be easily plugged in representative STR models to improve their performance owing to better textual reasoning. Specifically, we construct our model, namely S-GTR, by paralleling GTR to the language model in a segmentation-based STR baseline, which can effectively exploit the visual-linguistic complementarity via mutual learning. S-GTR sets new state-of-the-art on six challenging STR benchmarks and generalizes well to multi-linguistic datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/adeline-cs/GTR."

However, little is known about how employers view student open source contributions. This paper addresses two research questions qualitatively: what traits do employers desire for entry-level hires in 2025, and how can they be demonstrated through open source contributions? It also tests quantitatively the hypothesis that student knowledge of employers' expectations will improve their motivation to work on open source projects. To answer our qualitative questions, we conducted interviews with US hiring managers. We collaborated with each interviewee to create a \"hiring manager agreement,\" which listed desirable traits and specific ways to demonstrate them through open source, along with a promise to interview some students meeting the criteria. To evaluate our quantitative hypothesis, we surveyed 650 undergraduates attending public universities in the US using an instrument based on expectancy-value theory. Hiring managers wanted many non-technical traits that are difficult to teach in traditional CS classes, such as initiative. There were many commonalities in how employers wanted to see these traits demonstrated in open source contributions. Viewing hiring manager agreements improved student motivation to contribute to open source projects. Our findings suggest that open source contributions may help CS undergraduates get hired, but this requires sustained engagement in multiple areas. Educators can motivate students by sharing employer expectations, but further work is required to determine if this changes their behavior."

Although the sparsity of targets in three-dimensional (3D) space has led most research to adopt compressed sensing (CS)-based imaging algorithms, these often require substantial computational and memory burdens. Drawing inspiration from conventional Fourier transform (FT)-based imaging methods, our research seeks to accelerate radio imaging in RIS-aided communication systems. To begin, we introduce a two-stage wavenumber domain 3D imaging technique: first, we modify RIS phase shifts to recover the equivalent channel response from the user equipment to the RIS array, subsequently employing traditional FT-based wavenumber domain methods to produce target images. We also determine the diffraction resolution limits of the system through k-space analysis, taking into account factors including system bandwidth, transmission direction, operating frequency, and the angle subtended by the RIS. Addressing the challenge of limited pilots in communication systems, we unveil an innovative algorithm that merges the strengths of both FT- and CS-based techniques by substituting the expansive sensing matrix with FT-based operators. Our simulation outcomes confirm that our proposed FT-based methods achieve high-quality images while demanding few time, memory, and communication resources."

Optimal sensor placement uses historcal data to design tailored sampling patterns, yet its fixed, linear bases cannot adapt to nonlinear or sample-specific variations. Generative model-based compressed sensing improves reconstruction using deep generative priors but still employs suboptimal random sampling. We propose an adaptive sparse sensing framework that couples a variational autoencoder prior with reinforcement learning to select measurements sequentially. Experiments show that this approach outperforms CS, OSP, and Generative model-based reconstruction from sparse measurements."

    "title": "AMPLIFY:Attention-based Mixup for Performance Improvement and Label Smoothing in Transformer",
    "summary": "Mixup is an effective data augmentation method that generates new augmented samples by aggregating linear combinations of different original samples. However, if there are noises or aberrant features in the original samples, Mixup may propagate them to the augmented samples, leading to over-sensitivity of the model to these outliers . To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new Mixup method called AMPLIFY. This method uses the Attention mechanism of Transformer itself to reduce the influence of noises and aberrant values in the original samples on the prediction results, without increasing additional trainable parameters, and the computational cost is very low, thereby avoiding the problem of high resource consumption in common Mixup methods such as Sentence Mixup . The experimental results show that, under a smaller computational resource cost, AMPLIFY outperforms other Mixup methods in text classification tasks on 7 benchmark datasets, providing new ideas and new ways to further improve the performance of pre-trained models based on the Attention mechanism, such as BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and GPT.

Results measured on the Rb and Cs FIB systems were compared with results from commercially available gallium (Ga ) systems to verify the merits of applying Rb and Cs for imaging. The comparison shows that Rb and Cs have higher secondary electron (SE) yields on a variety of pure element targets than Ga , which implies a higher signal-to-noise ratio can be achieved for the same dose in SE imaging using Rb /Cs than Ga . In addition, analysis of the ion-induced ion signals reveals that secondary ions dominate Cs induced ion signals while the Rb /Ga induced signals contain more backscattered ions."

    "summary": "Using a tight-binding mode-space NEGF technique, we explore the essential physics, design and performance potential of the III-V core-shell (CS) nanowire (NW) heterojunction TFET. The CS TFET line-tunneling current increases significantly with the core diameter and outperforms the best III-V axial point-tunneling NW heterojunction TFET by up to 6x for = 6.6 nm. Reaching such a high level of current at low supply voltage, however, requires and involves specific and sometime unanticipated optimizations and physics that are thoroughly investigated here. In spite of the commonly accepted view, we also show and explain the weak gate-length dependency observed for the line-tunneling current in a III-V TFET. We further investigate the effect of electron-phonon scattering and discrete-dopant impurity band tails on optimized CS NW TFETs. Including those non-idealities, the CS-TFET inverter performance significantly outperforms that of the axial TFETs. The low-power (LP) VDD = 0.35V CS-inverter delay is comparable to that of the high-performance (HP) Si CMOS using VDD = 0.55V, which shows promise for a LP TFET technology with HP speed."

    "title": "High-resolution single-shot spiral diffusion-weighted imaging at 7T using expanded encoding with compressed sensing",
    "summary": "Purpose: The expanded encoding model incorporates spatially- and time-varying field perturbations for correction during reconstruction. So far, these reconstructions have used the conjugate gradient method with early stopping used as implicit regularization. However, this approach is likely suboptimal for low-SNR cases like diffusion or high-resolution MRI. Here, we investigate the extent that l1-wavelet regularization, or equivalently compressed sensing (CS), combined with expanded encoding improves trade-offs between spatial resolution, readout time and SNR for single-shot spiral diffusion-weighted imaging at 7T. The reconstructions were performed using our open-source GPU-enabled reconstruction toolbox, MatMRI, that allows inclusion of the different components of the expanded encoding model, with or without CS. Methods: In vivo accelerated single-shot spirals were acquired with five acceleration factors (2-6) and three in-plane spatial resolutions (1.5, 1.3, and 1.1 mm). From the in vivo reconstructions, we estimated diffusion tensors and computed fractional anisotropy maps. Then, simulations were used to quantitatively investigate and validate the impact of CS-based regularization on image quality when compared to a known ground truth. Results: In vivo reconstructions revealed improved image quality with retainment of small features when CS was used. Simulations showed that the joint use of the expanded encoding model and CS improves accuracy of image reconstructions (reduced mean-squared error) over the range of acceleration factors investigated. Conclusion: The expanded encoding model and CS regularization are complementary tools for single-shot spiral diffusion MRI, which enables both higher spatial resolutions and higher acceleration factors."

An automated pipeline is proposed, which encompasses five models: CNN, ResNet50, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB0 and NASNetMobile. The performance of the proposed architecture is evaluated on a balanced dataset and found to yield an accuracy of 99.33% for fine-tuned InceptionV3 model. Furthermore, Explainable AI approaches are incorporated to visualize the model's latent behavior in order to understand its black box behavior. To further optimize the training process, a cost-sensitive neural network approach has been proposed in order to work with imbalanced datasets which has achieved almost 4% more accuracy than the conventional models used in our experiments. The cost-sensitive InceptionV3 (CS-InceptionV3) and CNN (CS-CNN) show a promising accuracy of 92.31% and a recall value of 1.00 respectively on an imbalanced dataset.

    "title": "Robust Bayesian compressive sensing with data loss recovery for structural health monitoring signals",
    "summary": "The application of compressive sensing (CS) to structural health monitoring is an emerging research topic. The basic idea in CS is to use a specially-designed wireless sensor to sample signals that are sparse in some basis (e.g. wavelet basis) directly in a compressed form, and then to reconstruct (decompress) these signals accurately using some inversion algorithm after transmission to a central processing unit. However, most signals in structural health monitoring are only approximately sparse, i.e. only a relatively small number of the signal coefficients in some basis are significant, but the other coefficients are usually not exactly zero. In this case, perfect reconstruction from compressed measurements is not expected. A new Bayesian CS algorithm is proposed in which robust treatment of the uncertain parameters is explored, including integration over the prediction-error precision parameter to remove it as a \"nuisance\" parameter. The performance of the new CS algorithm is investigated using compressed data from accelerometers installed on a space-frame structure and on a cable-stayed bridge. Compared with other state-of-the-art CS methods including our previously-published Bayesian method which uses MAP (maximum a posteriori) estimation of the prediction-error precision parameter, the new algorithm shows superior performance in reconstruction robustness and posterior uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, our method can be utilized for recovery of lost data during wireless transmission, regardless of the level of sparseness in the signal."

This article contributes to the study of transitions arising from the degenerations of associative submanifolds into conically singular (CS) associative submanifolds. First, we study the moduli space of CS associative submanifolds with isolated singularities modeled on associative cones in , establishing transversality results in both fixed and one-parameter family of co-closed -structures. We prove that for a generic co-closed -structure (or a generic path thereof) there are no CS associative submanifolds having singularities modeled on cones with stability-index greater than (or , respectively). We establish that associative cones whose links are null-torsion holomorphic curves in have stability-index greater than , and all special Lagrangian cones in have stability-index greater than or equal to with equality only for the Harvey-Lawson -cone and a transverse pair of planes. Next, we study the desingularizations of CS associative submanifolds in a one-parameter family of co-closed -structures. Consequently, we derive desingularization results relating the above transitions for CS associative submanifolds with a Harvey-Lawson -cone singularity and for associative submanifolds with a transverse self-intersection."

Considering a large limit of a parameter \"lambda\" (we call this limit as long wave length limit), which is effectively the high temperature limit of the theory, we find that this non-local super-current boils down to a local quantity. The leading term (without the CS term) of this current matches with the result of Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. We compute the effect of the CS term on GL current and find that the effect is highly suppressed at large temperature (~1/T^4). Finally, free energy of the vortex configuration has been calculated. The free energy also receives non trivial correction at the order of 1/lambda^2 in the long wave length approximation."

    "summary": "The angle between two compressed sparse vectors subject to the norm/distance constraints imposed by the restricted isometry property (RIP) of the sensing matrix plays a crucial role in the studies of many compressive sensing (CS) problems. Assuming that (i) u and v are two sparse vectors separated by an angle thetha, and (ii) the sensing matrix Phi satisfies RIP, this paper is aimed at analytically characterizing the achievable angles between Phi*u and Phi*v. Motivated by geometric interpretations of RIP and with the aid of the well-known law of cosines, we propose a plane geometry based formulation for the study of the considered problem. It is shown that all the RIP-induced norm/distance constraints on Phi*u and Phi*v can be jointly depicted via a simple geometric diagram in the two-dimensional plane. This allows for a joint analysis of all the considered algebraic constraints from a geometric perspective. By conducting plane geometry analyses based on the constructed diagram, closed-form formulae for the maximal and minimal achievable angles are derived. Computer simulations confirm that the proposed solution is tighter than an existing algebraic-based estimate derived using the polarization identity. The obtained results are used to derive a tighter restricted isometry constant of structured sensing matrices of a certain kind, to wit, those in the form of a product of an orthogonal projection matrix and a random sensing matrix. Follow-up applications to three CS problems, namely, compressed-domain interference cancellation, RIP-based analysis of the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm, and the study of democratic nature of random sensing matrices are investigated."

Research efforts within HAR have mainly focused on how to efficiently extract and process both spatial and temporal dependencies of video sequences. In this paper, we propose and compare, two neural networks based on the convolutional long short-term memory unit, namely ConvLSTM, with differences in the architecture and the long-term learning strategy. The former uses a video-length adaptive input data generator ( stateless ) whereas the latter explores the stateful ability of general recurrent neural networks but applied in the particular case of HAR. This stateful property allows the model to accumulate discriminative patterns from previous frames without compromising computer memory. Experimental results on the large-scale NTU RGB+D dataset show that the proposed models achieve competitive recognition accuracies with lower computational cost compared with state-of-the-art methods and prove that, in the particular case of videos, the rarely-used stateful mode of recurrent neural networks significantly improves the accuracy obtained with the standard mode. The recognition accuracies obtained are 75.26\\% (CS) and 75.45\\% (CV) for the stateless model, with an average time consumption per video of 0.21 s, and 80.43\\% (CS) and 79.91\\%(CV) with 0.89 s for the stateful version."

Smart contracts, programs that run on the blockchain, have a code reuse rate of more than 90%, which means developers have a great demand for semantic code search tools. However, the existing code search models still have a semantic gap between code and query, and perform poorly on specialized queries of smart contracts. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Modal Smart contract Code Search (MM-SCS) model. Specifically, we construct a Contract Elements Dependency Graph (CEDG) for MM-SCS as an additional modality to capture the data-flow and control-flow information of the code. To make the model more focused on the key contextual information, we use a multi-head attention network to generate embeddings for code features. In addition, we use a fine-tuned pretrained model to ensure the model's effectiveness when the training data is small. We compared MM-SCS with four state-of-the-art models on a dataset with 470K (code, docstring) pairs collected from Github and Etherscan.

Then we combine the sparse constraint with the anti-uncertainty constraint to get an anti-uncertainty sparse signal recovery operator. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed operator has a better reconstructing performance with the MMU than traditional methods."

A clear ``hourglass'' magnetic field morphology was inferred from the polarized dust emission which is also directly seen from the polarized CS emission across velocity, where the polarization appears to be parallel to the field. By considering previous findings, the field retains a pinched shape which can be traced to clump length-scales from the envelope scales traced by ALMA, suggesting that the field is dynamically important across multiple length-scales in this region. The CS total intensity emission is found to be optically thick ( ) while the C S emission appears to be optically thin ( ). This suggests that sources of anisotropy other than large velocity gradients, i.e. anisotropies in the radiation field are required to explain the polarized emission from CS seen by ALMA. By using four variants of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi technique and the angle dispersion function methods (ADF), we obtain an average of estimates for the magnetic field strength onto the plane of the sky of mG from the dust and mG from the CS emission, where each emission traces different molecular hydrogen number densities.

Specifically, an overlap-add method of the time-domain training sequence is first proposed to obtain the coarse estimates of the channel length, path delays and path gains of the wireless channel, by exploiting the channel's temporal correlation to improve the robustness of the coarse CE under the severe fading channel with long delay spread. We then propose the priori-information aided (PA) iterative hard threshold (IHT) algorithm, which utilizes the priori information of the acquired coarse estimate for the wireless channel and therefore is capable of obtaining an accurate channel estimate of the doubly selective fading channel. Compared with the classical IHT algorithm whose convergence requires the norm of the measurement matrix being less than 1, the proposed PA-IHT algorithm exploits the priori information acquired to remove such a limitation as well as to reduce the number of required iterations. Compared with the existing CS based CE method for TDS-OFDM, the proposed PA-IHT algorithm significantly reduces the computational complexity of CE as well as enhances the CE accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that, without sacrificing spectral efficiency and changing the current TDS-OFDM signal structure, the proposed scheme performs better than the existing CE schemes for TDS-OFDM in various scenarios, especially under severely doubly selective fading channels."

    "summary": "Decoding motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, a key non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm for controlling external systems, has been significantly advanced by deep learning. However, MI-EEG decoding remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject variability and limited labeled target data, which necessitate costly calibration for new users. Many existing multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods indiscriminately incorporate all available source domains, disregarding the large inter-subject differences in EEG signals, which leads to negative transfer and excessive computational costs. Moreover, while many approaches focus on feature distribution alignment, they often neglect the explicit dependence between features and decision-level outputs, limiting their ability to preserve discriminative structures. To address these gaps, we propose a novel MSDA framework that leverages a pretrained large Brain Foundation Model (BFM) for dynamic and informed source subject selection, ensuring only relevant sources contribute to adaptation. Furthermore, we employ Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) and Conditional CS (CCS) divergences to jointly perform feature-level and decision-level alignment, enhancing domain invariance while maintaining class discriminability. Extensive evaluations on two benchmark MI-EEG datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms a broad range of state-of-the-art baselines. Additional experiments with a large source pool validate the scalability and efficiency of BFM-guided selection, which significantly reduces training time without sacrificing performance."

To control the infection, identifying and separating the infected people is the most crucial step. The main diagnostic tool is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Still, the sensitivity of the RT-PCR test is not high enough to effectively prevent the pandemic. The chest CT scan test provides a valuable complementary tool to the RT-PCR test, and it can identify the patients in the early-stage with high sensitivity. However, the chest CT scan test is usually time-consuming, requiring about 21.5 minutes per case. This paper develops a novel Joint Classification and Segmentation (JCS) system to perform real-time and explainable COVID-19 chest CT diagnosis. To train our JCS system, we construct a large scale COVID-19 Classification and Segmentation (COVID-CS) dataset, with 144,167 chest CT images of 400 COVID-19 patients and 350 uninfected cases. 3,855 chest CT images of 200 patients are annotated with fine-grained pixel-level labels of opacifications, which are increased attenuation of the lung parenchyma. We also have annotated lesion counts, opacification areas, and locations and thus benefit various diagnosis aspects.

Although domain-specific pre-training enhances efficiency and leads to smaller models, the computational costs of training these LLMs remain high, posing budgeting challenges. We introduce MediSwift, a suite of biomedical LMs that leverage sparse pre-training on domain-specific biomedical text data. By inducing up to 75% weight sparsity during the pre-training phase, MediSwift achieves a 2-2.5x reduction in training FLOPs. Notably, all sparse pre-training was performed on the Cerebras CS-2 system, which is specifically designed to realize the acceleration benefits from unstructured weight sparsity, thereby significantly enhancing the efficiency of the MediSwift models. Through subsequent dense fine-tuning and strategic soft prompting, MediSwift models outperform existing LLMs up to 7B parameters on biomedical tasks, setting new benchmarks w.r.t efficiency-accuracy on tasks such as PubMedQA. Our results show that sparse pre-training, along with dense fine-tuning and soft prompting, offers an effective method for creating high-performing, computationally efficient models in specialized domains."

However, water vapor condensing on a superhydrophobic surface can result in simultaneous formation of condensate droplets with two distinct wetting states, cassie state (CS) and partially wetting (PW) state. Droplets in PW state exhibit high contact angle but are connected to the substrate though a thin liquid condensate column. Coalescence between CS and PW droplets has been recently identified as a possible mechanism for generating droplets exhibiting in-plane roaming motion during dropwise condensation on nanotextured superhydrophobic surfaces. Here, we systematically investigate this phenomenon through experiments on coalescence between sessile droplets in CS and PW state on a nanostructured superhydrophobic surface endowed with a micro-scale hydrophilic spot. Here, a sessile droplet carefully placed on the hydrophilic spot simulates the PW state. Overall, our investigations demonstrate that when a CS droplet coalesces with a PW droplet pinned to a hydrophilic defect, the interaction generates substantial in-plane momentum. We find that when the coalescing CS and PW droplets are nearly of the same size and about ~3 to ~3.5 times the size of the hydrophilic spot pinning the PW droplet, the vertical momentum generation is nearly completely suppressed, and the resulting maxima in in-plane momentum results in detachment of merged droplet from hydrophilic spot and its subsequent in-plane motion."

    "summary": "Robots are being designed to communicate with people in various public and domestic venues in a helpful, discreet way. Here, we use a speculative approach to shine light on a new concept of robot steganography (RS), that a robot could seek to help vulnerable populations by discreetly warning of potential threats. We first identify some potentially useful scenarios for RS related to safety and security -- concerns that are estimated to cost the world trillions of dollars each year -- with a focus on two kinds of robots, an autonomous vehicle (AV) and a socially assistive humanoid robot (SAR). Next, we propose that existing, powerful, computer-based steganography (CS) approaches can be adopted with little effort in new contexts (SARs), while also pointing out potential benefits of human-like steganography (HS): although less efficient and robust than CS, HS represents a currently-unused form of RS that could also be used to avoid requiring computers or detection by more technically advanced adversaries. This analysis also introduces some unique challenges of RS that arise from message generation, indirect perception, and effects of perspective. For this, we explore some related theoretical and practical concerns for selecting carrier signals and generating messages, also making available some code and a video demo. Finally, we report on checking the current feasibility of the RS concept via a simplified user study, confirming that messages can be hidden in a robot's behaviors. The immediate implication is that RS could help to improve people's lives and mitigate some costly problems -- suggesting the usefulness of further discussion, ideation, and consideration by designers."

    "title": "Scalar induced gravitational waves from Chern-Simons gravity during inflation era",
    "summary": "We investigate the scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in the Chern-Simons (CS) gravity with a dynamical scalar field during slow roll inflation. Due to the parity violation in the CS term, the SIGWs are generally polarized, which are effectively characterized by the degree of circular polarization. We derive the semianalytic expression to evaluate the power spectra and the degree of circular polarization of the SIGWs, which receive contributions from the general relativity and the parity-violating term, respectively. We find that the correction from the parity-violating CS term is negligible on large scales, which means that the degree of circular polarization of SIGWs is very small."

    "title": "Results from a replicated experiment on the affective reactions of novice developers when applying test-driven development",
    "summary": "Test-driven Development (TDD) is an incremental approach to software development. Despite it is claimed to improve both quality of software and developers' productivity, the research on the claimed effects of TDD has so far shown inconclusive results. Some researchers have ascribed these inconclusive results to the negative affective states that TDD would provoke. A previous (baseline) experiment has, therefore, studied the affective reactions of (novice) developers---i.e., 29 third-year undergraduates in Computer Science (CS)---when practicing TDD to implement software. To validate the results of the baseline experiment, we conducted a replicated experiment that studies the affective reactions of novice developers when applying TDD to develop software. Developers in the treatment group carried out a development task using TDD, while those in the control group used a non-TDD approach. To measure the affective reactions of developers, we used the Self-Assessment Manikin instrument complemented with a liking dimension. The most important differences between the baseline and replicated experiments are: (i) the kind of novice developers involved in the experiments---third-year vs. second-year undergraduates in CS from two different universities; and (ii) their number---29 vs. 59. The results of the replicated experiment do not show any difference in the affective reactions of novice developers. Instead, the results of the baseline experiment suggest that developers seem to like TDD less as compared to a non-TDD approach and that developers following TDD seem to like implementing code less than the other developers, while testing code seems to make them less happy."

    "summary": "A new caesium (Cs) fountain clock NIM6 has been developed at the National Institute of Metrology (NIM) in China, for which a comprehensive uncertainty evaluation is presented. A three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (3D MOT) loading optical molasses is employed to obtain more cold atoms rapidly and efficiently with a tunable, uniform density distribution. A heat pipe surrounding the flight tube maintains a consistent and stable temperature within the interrogation region. Additionally, a Ramsey cavity with four azimuthally distribution feeds is utilized to mitigate distributed cavity phase shifts. The Cs fountain clock NIM6 achieves a short-term stability of 1.0x10-13 τ-1/2 at high atomic density, and a typical overall fractional type-B uncertainty is estimated to be 2.3x10-16. Comparisons of frequency between the Cs fountain NIM6 and other Cs fountain Primary Frequency Standards (PFSs) through Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) have demonstrated an agreement within the stated uncertainties."

    "summary": "Cs, which is the only stable cesium (Cs) isotope, is one of the most investigated elements in atomic spectroscopy and was used to realize the atomic clock in 1955. Among all atomic clocks, the cesium atomic clock has a special place, since the current unit of time is based on a microwave transition in the Cs atom. In addition, the long lifetime of the state and simple preparation technique of Cs vapor cells have great relevance to quantum and atom optics experiments, which suggests the use of the D2 transition as an optical frequency standard. In this work, using one laser as the local oscillator and Cs atoms as the quantum reference, we realized two atomic clocks in the optical and microwave frequencies, respectively. Both clocks could be freely switched or simultaneously output. The optical clock based on the vapor cell continuously operated with a frequency stability of at 1 s, decreasing to at 32 s, which was frequency stabilized by modulation transfer spectroscopy and estimated by an optical comb. Then, applying this stabilized laser for an optically pumped Cs beam atomic clock to reduce the laser frequency noise, we obtained a microwave clock with a frequency stability of , reaching at s. This study demonstrates an attractive feature for the commercialization and deployment of optical and microwave clocks and will guide further development of integrated atomic clocks with better stability. Thus, this study lays the groundwork for future quantum metrology and laser physics."

    "summary": "The compressive sensing (CS) scheme exploits much fewer measurements than suggested by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem to accurately reconstruct images, which has attracted considerable attention in the computational imaging community. While classic image CS schemes employed sparsity using analytical transforms or bases, the learning-based approaches have become increasingly popular in recent years. Such methods can effectively model the structures of image patches by optimizing their sparse representations or learning deep neural networks, while preserving the known or modeled sensing process. Beyond exploiting local image properties, advanced CS schemes adopt nonlocal image modeling, by extracting similar or highly correlated patches at different locations of an image to form a group to process jointly. More recent learning-based CS schemes apply nonlocal structured sparsity prior using group sparse representation (GSR) and/or low-rank (LR) modeling, which have demonstrated promising performance in various computational imaging and image processing applications. This article reviews some recent works in image CS tasks with a focus on the advanced GSR and LR based methods. Furthermore, we present a unified framework for incorporating various GSR and LR models and discuss the relationship between GSR and LR models. Finally, we discuss the open problems and future directions in the field."

This paper introduces the BioBridge framework, a novel approach that applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) in written free-text form to enhance decision-making in PED. In non-English speaking countries, such as South Korea, EMR data is often written in a Code-Switching (CS) format that mixes the native language with English, with most code-switched English words having clinical significance. The BioBridge framework consists of two core modules: \"bridging modality in context\" and \"unified bio-embedding.\" The \"bridging modality in context\" module improves the contextual understanding of bilingual and code-switched EMRs. In the \"unified bio-embedding\" module, the knowledge of the model trained in the medical domain is injected into the encoder-based model to bridge the gap between the medical and general domains. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BioBridge significantly performance traditional machine learning and pre-trained encoder-based models on several metrics, including F1 score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and Brier score. Specifically, BioBridge-XLM achieved enhancements of 0.85% in F1 score, 0.75% in AUROC, and 0.76% in AUPRC, along with a notable 3.04% decrease in the Brier score, demonstrating marked improvements in accuracy, reliability, and prediction calibration over the baseline XLM model.

    "summary": "The planetary nebula (PN) NGC3132 is a striking example of the dramatic but poorly understood, mass-loss phenomena that (1-8) Msun stars undergo during their death throes as they evolve into white dwarfs (WDs). From an analysis of JWST multiwavelength (0.9-18 micron) imaging of NGC3132, we report the discovery of an asymmetrical dust cloud around the WD central star (CS) of NGC3132, seen most prominently in the 18 micron~image, with a surface-brightness limited radial extent of >~2 arcsec. We show that the A2V star located 1.7 arcsec to CS's North-East (and 0.75 kpc from Earth) is gravitationally-bound to the latter, by the detection of relative orbital angular motion of (0.24+/-0.045) deg between these stars over ~20 yr. Using aperture photometry of the CS extracted from the JWST images, together with published optical photometry and an archival UV spectrum, we have constructed the spectral-energy distribution (SED) of the CS and its extended emission over the UV to mid-IR (0.091-18 micron) range. We find that fitting the SED of the CS and the radial intensity distributions at 7.7, 12.8 and 18 micron with thermal emission from dust requires a cloud that extends to a radius of >~1785 au, with a dust mass of ~1.3 x 10^(-2) M(Earth) and grains that are 70% silicate and 30% amorphous carbon. We propose plausible origins of the dust cloud and an evolutionary scenario in which a system of three stars -- the CS, a close low-mass companion, and a more distant A2V star -- forms a stable hierarchical triple system on the main-sequence but becomes dynamically unstable later, resulting in the spectacular mass-ejections that form the current, multipolar PN."

    "summary": "We studied a system formed by a mixture of a thermoresponsive negatively charged graft copolymer (Alg-g-PNIPAAm) with a brush-type structure, and an oppositely charged surfactant (DTAB), in bulk and at the air-solution interface. We performed experiments of surface tension, electrophoretic mobility, dynamic and static light scattering and atomic force microscopy in order to characterize the complexes formed as a function of DTAB concentration and temperature. We found that these polymer-surfactant complexes are able to respond by changing their sizes, both in bulk and at the air-solution interface, when T is increased above the coil-globule transition temperature (LSCT) of the copolymer. However, the thermoresponse was found to be dependent on surfactant concentration, cs: for cs = 2.8 mM, the opposite behavior takes place, i.e. the size increases with T. At the interface, the intensity of the effect produced on the surface tension by increasing T above LCST diminishes continuously as cs increases, reducing the ability of the interfacial complex to respond to temperature changes. We studied the stability of aqueous foams formulated with these mixtures as a function of T and cs. We found that the stability of the foam can be modulated by changing T, but we observed that this effect is dependent on the surfactant concentration range. We found a correlation between changes in the aggregates sizes, the surface tension behavior and the responsiveness of foam stability to changes of temperature."

    "title": "Sub-Nyquist SAR via Fourier Domain Range Doppler Processing",
    "summary": "Conventional Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems are limited in their ability to satisfy the increasing requirement for improved spatial resolution and wider coverage. The demand for high resolution requires high sampling rates, while coverage is limited by the pulse repetition frequency. Consequently, sampling rate reduction is of high practical value in SAR imaging. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm, equivalent to the well-known Range-Doppler method, to process SAR data using the Fourier series coefficients of the raw signals. We then demonstrate how to exploit the algorithm features to reduce sampling rate in both range and azimuth axes and process the signals at sub-Nyquist rates, by using compressed sensing (CS) tools. In particular, we demonstrate recovery of an image using only a portion of the received signal's bandwidth and also while dropping a large percentage of the transmitted pulses. The complementary pulses may be used to capture other scenes within the same coherent processing interval. In addition, we propose exploiting the ability to reconstruct the image from narrow bands in order to dynamically adapt the transmitted waveform energy to vacant spectral bands, paving the way to cognitive SAR. The proposed recovery algorithms form a new CS-SAR imaging method that can be applied to high-resolution SAR data acquired at sub-Nyquist rates in range and azimuth. The performance of our method is assessed using simulated and real data sets. Finally, our approach is implemented in hardware using a previously suggested Xampling radar prototype."

    "summary": "Compositional reasoning is a hallmark of human visual intelligence. Yet, despite the size of large vision-language models, they struggle to represent simple compositions by combining objects with their attributes. To measure this lack of compositional capability, we design Cola, a text-to-image retrieval benchmark to Compose Objects Localized with Attributes. To solve Cola, a model must retrieve images with the correct configuration of attributes and objects and avoid choosing a distractor image with the same objects and attributes but in the wrong configuration. Cola contains about 1.2k composed queries of 168 objects and 197 attributes on around 30K images. Our human evaluation finds that Cola is 83.33% accurate, similar to contemporary compositionality benchmarks. Using Cola as a testbed, we explore empirical modeling designs to adapt pre-trained vision-language models to reason compositionally. We explore 6 adaptation strategies on 2 seminal vision-language models, using compositionality-centric test benchmarks - Cola and CREPE. We find the optimal adaptation strategy is to train a multi-modal attention layer that jointly attends over the frozen pre-trained image and language features. Surprisingly, training multimodal layers on CLIP performs better than tuning a larger FLAVA model with already pre-trained multimodal layers. Furthermore, our adaptation strategy improves CLIP and FLAVA to comparable levels, suggesting that training multimodal layers using contrastive attribute-object data is key, as opposed to using them pre-trained. Lastly, we show that Cola is harder than a closely related contemporary benchmark, CREPE, since simpler fine-tuning strategies without multimodal layers suffice on CREPE but not on Cola. However, we still see a significant gap between our best adaptation and human accuracy, suggesting considerable room for further research."

    "summary": "Content creation has dramatically progressed with the rapid advancement of large language models like ChatGPT and Claude. While this progress has greatly enhanced various aspects of life and work, it has also negatively affected certain areas of society. A recent survey revealed that nearly 30% of college students use generative AI to help write academic papers and reports. Most countermeasures treat the detection of AI-generated text as a binary classification task and thus lack robustness. This approach overlooks human involvement in the generation of content even though human-machine collaboration is becoming mainstream. Besides generating entire texts, people may use machines to complete or revise texts. Such human involvement varies case by case, which makes binary classification a less than satisfactory approach. We refer to this situation as participation detection obfuscation. We propose using BERTScore as a metric to measure human involvement in the generation process and a multi-task RoBERTa-based regressor trained on a token classification task to address this problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we simulated academic-based scenarios and created a continuous dataset reflecting various levels of human involvement. All of the existing detectors we examined failed to detect the level of human involvement on this dataset. Our method, however, succeeded (F1 score of 0.9423 and a regressor mean squared error of 0.004). Moreover, it demonstrated some generalizability across generative models.

In this paper, the quantization reference voltage of the MWC is theoretically analyzed and the conclusion demonstrates that the reference voltage is proportional to the square root of , which is a trade-off parameter between sampling rate and number of channels. Further discussions and simulation results show that the reference voltage is proportional to the square root of when the signal consists of narrowband signals."

We derive the Bogomol'nyi-type or self-dual equations for a scalar potential, when the scalar and topological masses are equal.

Three theoretical models of increasing complexity are employed to quantify its influence on the scaling factor and the three-body parameter: a simple Born-Oppenheimer picture, a zero-range theory, and a spinless van der Waals model. These models are compared to Efimov resonances observed in an ultracold mixture of bosonic Cs and fermionic Li atoms close to two Cs-Li Feshbach resonances located at 843 G and 889 G, characterized by different sign and magnitude of the Cs-Cs interaction. By changing the sign and magnitude of the intraspecies scattering length different scaling behaviors of the three-body loss rate are identified, in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. The three-body loss rate is strongly influenced by the intraspecies scattering length."

However, not all configurations of CS theory correspond to asymptotically AdS 3-manifolds. We show that configurations that do have the metric interpretation are parameterized by the so-called projective structures on the boundary. The corresponding asymptotic phase space is shown to be the cotangent bundle over the Schottky space of the boundary. This singles out a ``gravitational'' sector of the SL(2,C) CS theory.

Nevertheless, acquisitions suffer from relatively low spatial resolution and limited heart coverage. Compressed sensing (CS) methods have been proposed to accelerate FPP-CMR and achieve higher spatial resolution. However, the long reconstruction times have limited the widespread clinical use of CS in FPP-CMR. Deep learning techniques based on supervised learning have emerged as alternatives for speeding up reconstructions. However, these approaches require fully sampled data for training, which is not possible to obtain, particularly high-resolution FPP-CMR images. Here, we propose a physics-informed self-supervised deep learning FPP-CMR reconstruction approach for accelerating FPP-CMR scans and hence facilitate high spatial resolution imaging. The proposed method provides high-quality FPP-CMR images from 10x undersampled data without using fully sampled reference data."

We show that differing from the nonmagnetic impurity scattering, wave approximation is not advisable and convergent in the present case. The symmetry of CS is reduced and the backscattering occurs and becomes stronger with increasing the effective magnetic moment of single magnetic impurity. We show a non-zero perpendicular resistivity component , which may be useful for tuning the Hall voltage of the sample. Consistent with the analysis of , by comparing with , we can determine different weights of backscattering and forward scattering.

This unitary lattice calculation is conducted using the domain wall fermion discretization scheme, a fine lattice spacing of approximately 0.08 fm, and physical values for light and strange quark masses. The CS kernel is determined analyzing the ratios of pion quasi-TMD wave functions (quasi-TMDWFs) at next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) perturbative accuracy. Thanks to the absence of Wilson-lines, the Coulomb-gauge-fixed quasi-TMDWF demonstrates a remarkably slower decay of signals with increasing quark separations. This allows us to access the non-perturbative CS kernel up to transverse separations of 1 fm. For small transverse separations, our results agree well with perturbative predictions. At larger transverse separations, our non-perturbative CS kernel clearly favors certain global fits."

Traditional CS-MRI methods often separately address measurement subsampling, image reconstruction, and task prediction, resulting in a suboptimal end-to-end performance. In this work, we propose TACKLE as a unified co-design framework for jointly optimizing subsampling, reconstruction, and prediction strategies for the performance on downstream tasks. The naïve approach of simply appending a task prediction module and training with a task-specific loss leads to suboptimal downstream performance. Instead, we develop a training procedure where a backbone architecture is first trained for a generic pre-training task (image reconstruction in our case), and then fine-tuned for different downstream tasks with a prediction head. Experimental results on multiple public MRI datasets show that TACKLE achieves an improved performance on various tasks over traditional CS-MRI methods. We also demonstrate that TACKLE is robust to distribution shifts by showing that it generalizes to a new dataset we experimentally collected using different acquisition setups from the training data. Without additional fine-tuning, TACKLE leads to both numerical and visual improvements compared to existing baselines. We have further implemented a learned 4 -accelerated sequence on a Siemens 3T MRI Skyra scanner.

However, long-range dependencies are difficult to model due to their temporal changes and high dimensionality makes it difficult to obtain similarities effectively and efficiently. Thus, to address these issues, we propose contrast similarity-aware dual-pathway Mamba for MTS node classification (CS-DPMamba). Firstly, to obtain the dynamic similarity of each sample, we initially use temporal contrast learning module to acquire MTS representations. And then we construct a similarity matrix between MTS representations using Fast Dynamic Time Warping (FastDTW). Secondly, we apply the DPMamba to consider the bidirectional nature of MTS, allowing us to better capture long-range and short-range dependencies within the data. Finally, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network enhanced Graph Isomorphism Network to complete the information interaction in the matrix and MTS node classification task. By comprehensively considering the long-range dependencies and dynamic similarity features, we achieved precise MTS node classification. We conducted experiments on multiple University of East Anglia (UEA) MTS datasets, which encompass diverse application scenarios. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our method through both supervised and semi-supervised experiments on the MTS classification task."

    "title": "Opportunistic Routing for Opto-Acoustic Internet of Underwater Things",
    "summary": "Internet of underwater things (IoUT) is a technological revolution that could mark a new era for scientific, industrial, and military underwater applications. To mitigate the hostile underwater channel characteristics, this paper hybridizes underwater acoustic and optical wireless communications to achieve a ubiquitous control and high-speed low-latency networking performance, respectively. Since underwater optical wireless communications (UOWC) suffers from limited range, it requires effective multi-hop routing solutions. In this regard, we propose a Sector-based Opportunistic Routing (SectOR) protocol. Unlike the traditional routing (TR) techniques which unicast packets to a unique relay, opportunistic routing (OR) targets a set of candidate relays by leveraging the broadcast nature of the UOWC channel. OR improves the packet delivery ratio as the likelihood of having at least one successful packet reception is much higher than that in conventional unicast routing. Contingent upon the performance characterization of a single-hop link, we obtain a variety of local and global metrics to evaluate the fitness of a candidate set (CS) and prioritize the members of a CS. Since rate-error and range-beamwidth tradeoffs yield different candidate set diversities, we develop a candidate filtering and searching algorithm to find the optimal sector-shaped coverage region by scanning the feasible search space. Moreover, a hybrid acoustic/optic coordination mechanism is considered to avoid duplicate transmission of the relays. Numerical results show that SectOR protocol can perform even better than an optimal unicast routing protocol in well-connected UOWNs."

    "summary": "We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion, ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively."

    "summary": "In this paper, a channel estimator for wideband millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with hybrid architectures and low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is proposed. To account for the propagation delay across the antenna array, which cannot be neglected in wideband mmWave massive MIMO systems, the discrete time channel that models the spatial wideband effect is developed. Also, the training signal design that addresses inter-frame, inter-user, and inter-symbol interferences is investigated when the spatial wideband effect is not negligible. To estimate the channel parameters over the continuum based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion, the Newtonized fully corrective forward greedy selection-cross validation-based (NFCFGS-CV-based) channel estimator is proposed. NFCFGS-CV is a gridless compressed sensing (CS) algorithm, whose termination condition is determined by the CV technique. The CV-based termination condition is proved to achieve the minimum squared error (SE). The simulation results show that NFCFGS-CV outperforms state-of-the-art on-grid CS-based channel estimators."

CS not only depends on the transport properties of the conductor but also depends on the correlations among particles which compose the incident beam. In this paper we present general results for the CS of entangled electron pairs traversing a beam splitter and we show that the probability that Q charges have passed is not binomial, as in the uncorrelated case, but rather it is symmetric with respect to the average transferred charge. We furthermore consider the joint probability for transmitted charges of a given spin and we show that the signature of entanglement distinctly appears in a correlation which is not present for the non-entangled case."

    "title": "Compressive sampling for energy spectrum estimation of turbulent flows",
    "summary": "Recent results from compressive sampling (CS) have demonstrated that accurate reconstruction of sparse signals often requires far fewer samples than suggested by the classical Nyquist--Shannon sampling theorem. Typically, signal reconstruction errors are measured in the norm and the signal is assumed to be sparse, compressible or having a prior distribution. Our spectrum estimation by sparse optimization (SpESO) method uses prior information about isotropic homogeneous turbulent flows with power law energy spectra and applies the methods of CS to 1-D and 2-D turbulence signals to estimate their energy spectra with small logarithmic errors. SpESO is distinct from existing energy spectrum estimation methods which are based on sparse support of the signal in Fourier space. SpESO approximates energy spectra with an order of magnitude fewer samples than needed with Shannon sampling. Our results demonstrate that SpESO performs much better than lumped orthogonal matching pursuit (LOMP), and as well or better than wavelet-based best M-term or M/2-term methods, even though these methods require complete sampling of the signal before compression."

    "title": "Locally Scale Invariant Chern-Simons Actions in 3+1 Dimensions and Their Emergence From 4+2 Dimensional 2T-Physics",
    "summary": "The traditional Chern-Simons (CS) terms in 3+1 dimensions that modify General Relativity (GR), Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), typically lack scale invariance. However, a locally scale invariant and geodesically complete framework for the Standard Model (SM) coupled to GR was previously constructed by employing a tailored form of local scale (Weyl) symmetry. This refined SM+GR model closely resembles the conventional SM in subatomic realms where gravitational effects are negligible. Nevertheless, it offers an intriguing prediction: the emergence of new physics beyond the traditional SM and GR near spacetime singularities, characterized by intense gravity and substantial deviations in the Higgs field. In this study, we expand upon the enhanced SM+GR by incorporating Weyl invariant CS terms for gravity, QCD, and QED in 3+1 dimensions, thereby integrating CS contributions within the locally scale-invariant and geodesically complete paradigm. Additionally, we establish a holographic correspondence between the new CS terms in 3+1 dimensions and novel 4+2 dimensional CS-type actions within 2T-physics. We demonstrate that the Weyl transformation in 3+1 dimensions arises from 4+2 general coordinate transformations, which unify the hidden extra 1+1 large (not curled up) dimensions with the evident 3+1 dimensions. By leveraging the newfound local conformal symmetry, the augmented and geodesically complete SM+GR+CS introduces innovative tools and perspectives for exploring classical field theory aspects of black hole and cosmological singularities in 3+1 dimensions, while the 4+2 dimensional connection unveils deeper facets of spacetime."

    "title": "Fourier Domain Beamforming: The Path to Compressed Ultrasound Imaging",
    "summary": "Sonography techniques use multiple transducer elements for tissue visualization. Signals detected at each element are sampled prior to digital beamforming. The sampling rates required to perform high resolution digital beamforming are significantly higher than the Nyquist rate of the signal and result in considerable amount of data, that needs to be stored and processed. A recently developed technique, compressed beamforming, based on the finite rate of innovation model, compressed sensing (CS) and Xampling ideas, allows to reduce the number of samples needed to reconstruct an image comprised of strong reflectors. A drawback of this method is its inability to treat speckle, which is of significant importance in medical imaging. Here we build on previous work and extend it to a general concept of beamforming in frequency. This allows to exploit the low bandwidth of the ultrasound signal and bypass the oversampling dictated by digital implementation of beamforming in time. Using beamforming in frequency, the same image quality is obtained from far fewer samples. We next present a CS-technique that allows for further rate reduction, using only a portion of the beamformed signal's bandwidth. We demonstrate our methods on in vivo cardiac data and show that reductions up to 1/28 over standard beamforming rates are possible. Finally, we present an implementation on an ultrasound machine using sub-Nyquist sampling and processing. Our results prove that the concept of sub-Nyquist processing is feasible for medical ultrasound, leading to the potential of considerable reduction in future ultrasound machines size, power consumption and cost."

Both strength and good technique is required to successfully reach the top of a climb, and often coaches work to improve technique so less strength is required, enabling a climber to ascent more difficult climbs. Various aspects of adding computer-interaction to climbing have been studied in recent years, but there is a large space for research into lightweight tools to aid recreational intermediate climbers, both with trickier climbs and to improve their own technique. In this CS Masters final project, I explored which form of data-capture and output-features could improve a climber's training, and analysed how climbers responded to viewing their data throughout a climbing session, then conducted a user-centred design to build a lightweight mobile application for intermediate climbers. A variety of hardware and software solutions were explored, tested and developed through series of surveys, discussions, wizard-of-oz studies and prototyping, resulting in a system that most closely meets the needs of local indoor boulderers given the project's time scope. This consists of an iteratively developed interactive mobile app that: can record, graph, and score the acceleration of a climber, as both a training tool and gamification incentive for good technique; can link a video recording to the acceleration graph, to enable frame-by-frame inspection of weaknesses; is fully approved and distributed on the Google play Store and currently being regularly used by 15 local climbers. Then I conducted a final usability study, comprising a thematic analysis of forty minutes's worth of interview transcripts, to gain a deep understanding of the app's impact on the climbers using it, along with its benefits and limitations."

    "summary": "This paper discusses the formulation of the non-commutative Chern-Simons (CS) theory where the spatial slice, an infinite strip, is a manifold with boundaries. As standard star products are not correct for such manifolds, the standard non-commutative CS theory is not also appropriate here. Instead we formulate a new finite-dimensional matrix CS model as an approximation to the CS theory on the strip. A work which has points of contact with ours is due to Lizzi, Vitale and Zampini where the authors obtain a description for the fuzzy disc. The gauge fields in our approach are operators supported on a subspace of finite dimension N+ηof the Hilbert space of eigenstates of a simple harmonic oscillator with N, η Z^+ and N 0. This oscillator is associated with the underlying Moyal plane. The resultant matrix CS theory has a fuzzy edge. It becomes the required sharp edge when N and ηgoes to infinity in a suitable sense. The non-commutative CS theory on the strip is defined by this limiting procedure. After performing the canonical constraint analysis of the matrix theory, we find that there are edge observables in the theory generating a Lie algebra with properties similar to that of a non-abelian Kac-Moody algebra. Our study shows that there are (η+1)^2 abelian charges (observables) given by the matrix elements ( A_i)_ N-1 N-1 and ( A_i)_ nm (where n or m N) of the gauge fields, that obey certain standard canonical commutation relations. In addition, the theory contains three unique non-abelian charges, localized near the N^th level. We show that all non-abelian edge observables except these three can be constructed from the abelian charges above. Using the results of this analysis we discuss the large N and ηlimit."

    "summary": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized medical imaging, providing a non-invasive and highly detailed look into the human body. However, the long acquisition times of MRI present challenges, causing patient discomfort, motion artifacts, and limiting real-time applications. To address these challenges, researchers are exploring various techniques to reduce acquisition time and improve the overall efficiency of MRI. One such technique is compressed sensing (CS), which reduces data acquisition by leveraging image sparsity in transformed spaces. In recent years, deep learning (DL) has been integrated with CS-MRI, leading to a new framework that has seen remarkable growth. DL-based CS-MRI approaches are proving to be highly effective in accelerating MR imaging without compromising image quality. This review comprehensively examines DL-based CS-MRI techniques, focusing on their role in increasing MR imaging speed.

    "summary": "Micro-Action Recognition (MAR) has gained increasing attention due to its crucial role as a form of non-verbal communication in social interactions, with promising potential for applications in human communication and emotion analysis. However, current approaches often overlook the inherent ambiguity in micro-actions, which arises from the wide category range and subtle visual differences between categories. This oversight hampers the accuracy of micro-action recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel Prototypical Calibrating Ambiguous Network (PCAN) to unleash and mitigate the ambiguity of MAR. Firstly, we employ a hierarchical action-tree to identify the ambiguous sample, categorizing them into distinct sets of ambiguous samples of false negatives and false positives, considering both body- and action-level categories. Secondly, we implement an ambiguous contrastive refinement module to calibrate these ambiguous samples by regulating the distance between ambiguous samples and their corresponding prototypes. This calibration process aims to pull false negative (FN) samples closer to their respective prototypes and push false positive (FP) samples apart from their affiliated prototypes. In addition, we propose a new prototypical diversity amplification loss to strengthen the model's capacity by amplifying the differences between different prototypes. Finally, we propose a prototype-guided rectification to rectify prediction by incorporating the representability of prototypes. Extensive experiments conducted on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/kunli-cs/PCAN."

Lett. 97, 255001 (2006)] by shining two laser pulses a distance apart on a solid target layer. An elongated current sheet (CS) was observed in the plasma between the two laser spots. In order to more closely model magnetotail reconnection, here two side-by-side thin target layers, instead of a single one, are used. It is found that at one end of the elongated CS a fan-like electron outflow region including three well-collimated electron jets appears. The ( MeV) tail of the jet energy distribution exhibits a power-law scaling. The enhanced electron acceleration is attributed to the intense inductive electric field in the narrow electron dominated reconnection region, as well as additional acceleration as they are trapped inside the rapidly moving plasmoid formed in and ejected from the CS. The ejection also induces a secondary CS."

The CS and SO emission traces the 5000 au envelope that hosts the SVS13-A and VLA3 young stellar objects, and CH3OH probes the compact hot corino associated with SVS13-A. In addition, CS blue-shifted emission reveals a molecular shell in the direction of the jet driven by SVS13-A that is revealed by high-velocity SiO, SO and low-velocity H_2 emission. We also imaged the protostellar jet driven by SVS13-B in SiO, and in SO, CS, and CH3OH for the first time as well. The molecules peak at different distances from the driving source: SiO(2-1) peaks at about 1600 au, and SO(2_3-1_2), CS(2--1) and CH3OH(2_k,k-1_k,k) peak at about 2000-2850 au. Moreover, SiO(2-1) emits at larger distances than SiO(5--4), indicating a lower excitation at a larger distance from the protostar.

A slower and wider (transversal size of about 750 au) component is probed by methanol, which is released from dust mantles at lower shock velocities (< 10 km/s). The SO and CS emission traces an intermediate component with respect to the components probed by SiO and CH3OH. High spatial resolution imaging (down to 10 au) of the jet of SVS13-B in multiple species will aid in reconstructing the chemistry of shocked material in protostellar jets."

These novel methods have demonstrated impressive performance in univariate and low-dimensional multivariate time-series forecasting tasks.

In this paper, inspired by a change of basis in the Hilbert space, we propose a flexible data feature extraction technique that excels in high-dimensional multivariate forecasting tasks.

While specialized, competing and alternative CI building blocks are inherent to a healthy ecosystem, it also becomes apparent that the increasing degree of fragmentation is hindering interoperation, and thus limiting collaboration, which is essential for modern science communities often spanning international groups and multiple disciplines (but even 'small sciences', with smaller and localized communities, are often embedded into the larger scientific ecosystem, and are increasingly dependent on the availability of CI.) There are different reasons why fragmentation occurs, on technical and social level. But also, it is apparent that the current funding model for creating CI components largely fails to aid the transition from research to production, by mixing CS research and IT engineering challenges into the same funding strategies. The 10th anniversary of the EU funded project 'Grid Lab' (which was an early and ambitious attempt on providing a consolidated and science oriented cyberinfrastructure software stack to a specific science community) was taken as an opportunity to invite international leaders and early stage researchers in grid computing and e-Science from Europe, America and Asia, and, together with representatives of the EU and US funding agencies, to discuss the fundamental aspects of CI evolution, and to contemplate the options for a more coherent, more coordinated approach to the global evolution of CI.

We have examined the properties of the CS in some detail in order to assess its cosmological significance. We have performed a cluster analysis of the local extrema in the CMB signal to show that the CS is actually associated with a large group of extrema rather than just one. In the light of this we have re-examined the properties of the WMAP ILC and co-added \"cleaned\" WCM maps, which have previously been used for the analysis of the properties of the signal in the vicinity of the CS. These two maps have remarkably similar properties on equal latitude rings for |b|>30deg, as well as in the vicinity of the CS. We have also checked the idea that the CMB signal has a non-Gaussian tail, localized in the low multipole components of the signal. For each ring we apply a linear filter with characteristic scale R, dividing the CMB signal in two parts: the filtered part, with characteristic scale above that of the filter R, and the difference between the initial and filtered signal. Using the filter scale as a variable, we can maximize the skewness and kurtosis of the smoothed signal and minimize these statistics for the difference between initial and filtered signal. We have discovered that the shape of the CS is formed primarily by the components of the CMB signal represented by multipoles between 10 30deg in both the ILC and WCM maps, rather than a single localized feature. After subtraction of this modulation, the remaining part of the CMB signal appears to be consistent with statistical homogeneity and Gaussianity."

Despite considerable advance, the reasons on effectiveness of GCP on deep CNNs have not been well studied. In this paper, we make an attempt to understand what deep CNNs benefit from GCP in a viewpoint of optimization. Specifically, we explore the effect of GCP on deep CNNs in terms of the Lipschitzness of optimization loss and the predictiveness of gradients, and show that GCP can make the optimization landscape more smooth and the gradients more predictive. Furthermore, we discuss the connection between GCP and second-order optimization for deep CNNs. More importantly, above findings can account for several merits of covariance pooling for training deep CNNs that have not been recognized previously or fully explored, including significant acceleration of network convergence (i.e., the networks trained with GCP can support rapid decay of learning rates, achieving favorable performance while significantly reducing number of training epochs), stronger robustness to distorted examples generated by image corruptions and perturbations, and good generalization ability to different vision tasks, e.g., object detection and instance segmentation. We conduct extensive experiments using various deep CNN models on diversified tasks, and the results provide strong support to our findings."

    "summary": "Hybrid massive MIMO structures with reduced hardware complexity and power consumption have been widely studied as a potential candidate for millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. Channel estimators that require knowledge of the array response, such as those using compressive sensing (CS) methods, may suffer from performance degradation when array-inherent impairments bring unknown phase errors and gain errors to the antenna elements. In this paper, we design matrix completion (MC)-based channel estimation schemes which are robust against the array-inherent impairments. We first design an open-loop training scheme that can sample entries from the effective channel matrix randomly and is compatible with the phase shifter-based hybrid system. Leveraging the low-rank property of the effective channel matrix, we then design a channel estimator based on the generalized conditional gradient (GCG) framework and the alternating minimization (AltMin) approach. The resulting estimator is immune to array-inherent impairments and can be implemented to systems with any array shapes for its independence of the array response. In addition, we extend our design to sample a transformed channel matrix following the concept of inductive matrix completion (IMC), which can be solved efficiently using our proposed estimator and achieve similar performance with a lower requirement of the dynamic range of the transmission power per antenna. Numerical results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed MC-based channel estimators in terms of estimation performance, computational complexity and robustness against array-inherent impairments over the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based CS channel estimator."

    "summary": "Rehearsal-based Continual Learning (CL) maintains a limited memory buffer to store replay samples for knowledge retention, making these approaches heavily reliant on the quality of the stored samples. Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios. Extensive comparative experiments show that our methods outperforms other baselines across various CL settings while ensuring favorable efficiency."

We aim at determining relationship between the region of pre-flare energy release with the regions where the flare started to develop, and to investigate a detailed chronology of energy release during the pre-flare time interval and the beginning of the impulse phase. Using X-ray, ultraviolet and radio microwave data we found that the pre-flare energy release site was compact and localized in the vicinity of TC interaction of magnetic structures near the polarity inversion line. The analysis indicates that a pre-flare current sheet (CS) could be in this region. Good correspondence between the location of the pre-flare and flare emission sources visible at the very beginning of the impulsive phase is shown. We found relationship between dynamics of the energy release in the pre-flare CS and formation of the future flare eruptive structure. The growth of the magnetic flux rope was associated with activation of plasma emissions, flows and an increase of UV radiation fluxes from the region where the pre-flare CS was located. The eruptive flux rope gradually grew due to feeding by magnetized plasma ejected from the reconnecting pre-flare CS. Finally, it is shown that the most probable trigger of the eruption was a local fast microflare-like magnetic reconnection in the pre-flare CS. Some local instability in the pre-flare sheet could lead to a transition from the slow to fast reconnection regime. As a result, an ejection from the sheet was initiated and the eruptive flux rope lost its stability. Then, the eruptive flux rope itself initiated formation of the main reconnecting flare CS as in the Standard Flare Model during its movement, and intense emissions associated with the impulsive phase were observed."

    "title": "White-box Induction From SVM Models: Explainable AI with Logic Programming",
    "summary": "We focus on the problem of inducing logic programs that explain models learned by the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The top-down sequential covering inductive logic programming (ILP) algorithms (e.g., FOIL) apply hill-climbing search using heuristics from information theory. A major issue with this class of algorithms is getting stuck in a local optimum. In our new approach, however, the data-dependent hill-climbing search is replaced with a model-dependent search where a globally optimal SVM model is trained first, then the algorithm looks into support vectors as the most influential data points in the model, and induces a clause that would cover the support vector and points that are most similar to that support vector. Instead of defining a fixed hypothesis search space, our algorithm makes use of SHAP, an example-specific interpreter in explainable AI, to determine a relevant set of features. This approach yields an algorithm that captures SVM model's underlying logic and outperforms %GG: the FOIL algorithm --> other ILP algorithms other ILP algorithms in terms of the number of induced clauses and classification evaluation metrics. This paper is under consideration for publication in the journal of \"Theory and practice of logic programming\"."

    "title": "Sparsity and Coefficient Permutation Based Two-Domain AMP for Image Block Compressed Sensing",
    "summary": "The learned denoising-based approximate message passing (LDAMP) algorithm has attracted great attention for image compressed sensing (CS) tasks. However, it has two issues: first, its global measurement model severely restricts its applicability to high-dimensional images, and its block-based measurement method exhibits obvious block artifacts; second, the denoiser in the LDAMP is too simple, and existing denoisers have limited ability in detail recovery. In this paper, to overcome the issues and develop a high-performance LDAMP method for image block compressed sensing (BCS), we propose a novel sparsity and coefficient permutation-based AMP (SCP-AMP) method consisting of the block-based sampling and the two-domain reconstruction modules. In the sampling module, SCP-AMP adopts a discrete cosine transform (DCT) based sparsity strategy to reduce the impact of the high-frequency coefficient on the reconstruction, followed by a coefficient permutation strategy to avoid block artifacts. In the reconstruction module, a two-domain AMP method with DCT domain noise correction and pixel domain denoising is proposed for iterative reconstruction. Regarding the denoiser, we proposed a multi-level deep attention network (MDANet) to enhance the texture details by employing multi-level features and multiple attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed SCP-AMP method achieved better reconstruction accuracy than other state-of-the-art BCS algorithms in terms of both visual perception and objective metrics."

    "summary": "Despite the advancement in the technology of autonomous driving cars, the safety of a self-driving car is still a challenging problem that has not been well studied. Motion prediction is one of the core functions of an autonomous driving car. Previously, we propose a novel scheme called GRIP which is designed to predict trajectories for traffic agents around an autonomous car efficiently. GRIP uses a graph to represent the interactions of close objects, applies several graph convolutional blocks to extract features, and subsequently uses an encoder-decoder long short-term memory (LSTM) model to make predictions. Even though our experimental results show that GRIP improves the prediction accuracy of the state-of-the-art solution by 30%, GRIP still has some limitations. GRIP uses a fixed graph to describe the relationships between different traffic agents and hence may suffer some performance degradations when it is being used in urban traffic scenarios. Hence, in this paper, we describe an improved scheme called GRIP++ where we use both fixed and dynamic graphs for trajectory predictions of different types of traffic agents. Such an improvement can help autonomous driving cars avoid many traffic accidents. Our evaluations using a recently released urban traffic dataset, namely ApolloScape showed that GRIP++ achieves better prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art schemes. GRIP++ ranked #1 on the leaderboard of the ApolloScape trajectory competition in October 2019. In addition, GRIP++ runs 21.7 times faster than a state-of-the-art scheme, CS-LSTM."

    "title": "DriveGen: Towards Infinite Diverse Traffic Scenarios with Large Models",
    "summary": "Microscopic traffic simulation has become an important tool for autonomous driving training and testing. Although recent data-driven approaches advance realistic behavior generation, their learning still relies primarily on a single real-world dataset, which limits their diversity and thereby hinders downstream algorithm optimization. In this paper, we propose DriveGen, a novel traffic simulation framework with large models for more diverse traffic generation that supports further customized designs. DriveGen consists of two internal stages: the initialization stage uses large language model and retrieval technique to generate map and vehicle assets; the rollout stage outputs trajectories with selected waypoint goals from visual language model and a specific designed diffusion planner. Through this two-staged process, DriveGen fully utilizes large models' high-level cognition and reasoning of driving behavior, obtaining greater diversity beyond datasets while maintaining high realism. To support effective downstream optimization, we additionally develop DriveGen-CS, an automatic corner case generation pipeline that uses failures of the driving algorithm as additional prompt knowledge for large models without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. Experiments show that our generated scenarios and corner cases have a superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Downstream experiments further verify that the synthesized traffic of DriveGen provides better optimization of the performance of typical driving algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework."

Inspired by the well-known compressive sensing (CS), the accurate super-resolution reconstruction from highly sparse data for the weakly scatters has been investigated in this paper. To realize the compressive data measurement, in particular, to obtain the super-resolution reconstruction with highly sparse data, the compressive system which is realized by surrounding the probed obstacles by the random media has been proposed and empirically studied. Several interesting conclusions have been drawn: (a) if the desired resolution is within the range from to, the K-sparse N-unknowns imaging can be obtained exactly bymeasurements, which is comparable to the required number of measurement by the Gaussian random matrix in the literatures of compressive sensing. (b) With incorporating the random media which is used to enforce the multi-path effect of wave propagation, the resulting measurement matrix is incoherence with wavelet matrix, in other words, when the probed obstacles are sparse with the framework of wavelet, the required number of measurements for successful reconstruction is similar as above. (c) If the expected resolution is lower than, the required number of measurements of proposed compressive system is almost identical to the case of free space. (d) There is also a requirement to make the tradeoff between the imaging resolutions and the number of measurements. In addition, by the introduction of complex Gaussian variable the kind of fast sparse Bayesian algorithm has been slightly modified to deal with the complex-valued optimization with sparse constraints."

    "title": "Cross-Scan Mamba with Masked Training for Robust Spectral Imaging",
    "summary": "Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) enables fast spectral imaging but requires effective decoding algorithms for hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction from compressed measurements. Current CNN-based methods are limited in modeling long-range dependencies, while Transformer-based models face high computational complexity. Although recent Mamba models outperform CNNs and Transformers in RGB tasks concerning computational efficiency or accuracy, they are not specifically optimized to fully leverage the local spatial and spectral correlations inherent in HSIs. To address this, we propose the Cross-Scanning Mamba, named CS-Mamba, that employs a Spatial-Spectral SSM for global-local balanced context encoding and cross-channel interaction promotion. Besides, while current reconstruction algorithms perform increasingly well in simulation scenarios, they exhibit suboptimal performance on real data due to limited generalization capability. During the training process, the model may not capture the inherent features of the images but rather learn the parameters to mitigate specific noise and loss, which may lead to a decline in reconstruction quality when faced with real scenes. To overcome this challenge, we propose a masked training method to enhance the generalization ability of models. Experiment results show that our CS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance and the masked training method can better reconstruct smooth features to improve the visual quality."

    "title": "3d-SMRnet: Achieving a new quality of MPI system matrix recovery by deep learning",
    "summary": "Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) data is commonly reconstructed using a system matrix acquired in a time-consuming calibration measurement. The calibration approach has the important advantage over model-based reconstruction that it takes the complex particle physics as well as system imperfections into account. This benefit comes for the cost that the system matrix needs to be re-calibrated whenever the scan parameters, particle types or even the particle environment (e.g. viscosity or temperature) changes. One route for reducing the calibration time is the sampling of the system matrix at a subset of the spatial positions of the intended field-of-view and employing system matrix recovery. Recent approaches used compressed sensing (CS) and achieved subsampling factors up to 28 that still allowed reconstructing MPI images of sufficient quality. In this work, we propose a novel framework with a 3d-System Matrix Recovery Network and demonstrate it to recover a 3d system matrix with a subsampling factor of 64 in less than one minute and to outperform CS in terms of system matrix quality, reconstructed image quality, and processing time. The advantage of our method is demonstrated by reconstructing open access MPI datasets. The model is further shown to be capable of inferring system matrices for different particle types."

    "title": "Fairness in Survival Analysis: A Novel Conditional Mutual Information Augmentation Approach",
    "summary": "Survival analysis, a vital tool for predicting the time to event, has been used in many domains such as healthcare, criminal justice, and finance. Like classification tasks, survival analysis can exhibit bias against disadvantaged groups, often due to biases inherent in data or algorithms. Several studies in both the IS and CS communities have attempted to address fairness in survival analysis. However, existing methods often overlook the importance of prediction fairness at pre-defined evaluation time points, which is crucial in real-world applications where decision making often hinges on specific time frames. To address this critical research gap, we introduce a new fairness concept: equalized odds (EO) in survival analysis, which emphasizes prediction fairness at pre-defined time points. To achieve the EO fairness in survival analysis, we propose a Conditional Mutual Information Augmentation (CMIA) approach, which features a novel fairness regularization term based on conditional mutual information and an innovative censored data augmentation technique. Our CMIA approach can effectively balance prediction accuracy and fairness, and it is applicable to various survival models. We evaluate the CMIA approach against several state-of-the-art methods within three different application domains, and the results demonstrate that CMIA consistently reduces prediction disparity while maintaining good accuracy and significantly outperforms the other competing methods across multiple datasets and survival models (e.g., linear COX, deep AFT)."

In this work, we used density functional theory (DFT) to investigate adsorption of Mg and Na adatoms on five M CS monolayers (where M= Mo, Nb, Ti, V, Zr) for battery applications. We assessed the stability of the adatom (i.e. Na and Mg)-monolayer systems by calculating adsorption and formation energies, as well as voltages as a function of surface coverage. For instance, we found that Mo CS cannot support a full layer of Na nor even a single Mg atom. Na and Mg exhibit the strongest binding on Zr CS , followed by Ti CS , Nb CS and V CS . Using the nudged elastic band method (NEB) we computed promising diffusion barriers for both dilute and nearly-full ion surface coverage cases. In the dilute ion adsorption case, a single Mg and Na atom on Ti CS experience 0.47 eV and 0.10 eV diffusion barriers between the lowest energy sites, respectively. For a nearly full surface coverage, a Na ion moving on Ti CS experiences a 0.33 eV energy barrier, implying a concentration dependent diffusion barrier. Our molecular dynamics results indicate that three (one) layers (layer) of Mg (Na) ion on both surfaces of Ti CS remain stable at T=300 K. While, according to voltage calculations, Zr CS can store Na up to three atomic layers, our MD simulations predict that the outermost layers detach from Zr CS monolayer due to weak interaction between Na ions and the monolayer. This suggests that MD simulations are essential to confirming the stability of an ion-electrode system - an insight that is mostly absence in previous studies."

The clinical utility of CMR is hampered by long acquisition times, however. In this work, we propose and validate a plug-and-play (PnP) method for CMR reconstruction from undersampled multi-coil data. To fully exploit the rich image structure inherent in CMR, we pair the PnP framework with a deep learning (DL)-based denoiser that is trained using spatiotemporal patches from high-quality, breath-held cardiac cine images. The resulting \"PnP-DL\" method iterates over data consistency and denoising subroutines. We compare the reconstruction performance of PnP-DL to that of compressed sensing (CS) using eight breath-held and ten real-time (RT) free-breathing cardiac cine datasets. We find that, for breath-held datasets, PnP-DL offers more than one dB advantage over commonly used CS methods. For RT free-breathing datasets, where ground truth is not available, PnP-DL receives higher scores in qualitative evaluation. The results highlight the potential of PnP-DL to accelerate RT CMR."

    "title": "Understanding star formation in molecular clouds III. Probability distribution functions of molecular lines in Cygnus X",
    "summary": "Column density (N) PDFs serve as a powerful tool to characterize the physical processes that influence the structure of molecular clouds. Star-forming clouds can best be characterized by lognormal PDFs for the lower N range and a power-law tail for higher N, commonly attributed to turbulence and self-gravity and/or pressure, respectively. We report here on PDFs obtained from observations of 12CO, 13CO, C18O, CS, and N2H+ in the Cygnus X North region and compare to a PDF derived from dust observations with the Herschel satellite. The PDF of 12CO is lognormal for Av~1-30, but is cut for higher Av due to optical depth effects. The PDFs of C18O and 13CO are mostly lognormal up for Av~1-15, followed by excess up to Av~40. Above that value, all CO PDFs drop, most likely due to depletion. The high density tracers CS and N2H+ exhibit only a power law distribution between Av~15 and 400, respectively. The PDF from dust is lognormal for Av~3-15 and has a power-law tail up to Av~500. Absolute values for the molecular line column densities are, however, rather uncertain due to abundance and excitation temperature variations. Taken the dust PDF face value, we 'calibrate' the molecular line PDF of CS to the one of the dust and determined an abundance [CS]/[H2] of 10^-9. The slopes of the power-law tails of the CS, N2H+, and dust PDFs are consistent with free-fall collapse of filaments and clumps. A quasi static configuration of filaments and clumps can possibly also account for the observed N-PDFs, as long as they have a sufficiently condensed density structure and external ram pressure by gas accretion is provided. The somehow flatter slopes of N2H+ and CS can reflect an abundance change and/or subthermal excitation at low column densities."

    "title": "LocDiff: Identifying Locations on Earth by Diffusing in the Hilbert Space",
    "summary": "Image geolocalization is a fundamental yet challenging task, aiming at inferring the geolocation on Earth where an image is taken. State-of-the-art methods employ either grid-based classification or gallery-based image-location retrieval, whose spatial generalizability significantly suffers if the spatial distribution of test images does not align with the choices of grids and galleries. Recently emerging generative approaches, while getting rid of grids and galleries, use raw geographical coordinates and suffer quality losses due to their lack of multi-scale information. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-scale latent diffusion model called LocDiff for image geolocalization. We developed a novel positional encoding-decoding framework called Spherical Harmonics Dirac Delta (SHDD) Representations, which encodes points on a spherical surface (e.g., geolocations on Earth) into a Hilbert space of Spherical Harmonics coefficients and decodes points (geolocations) by mode-seeking on spherical probability distributions. We also propose a novel SirenNet-based architecture (CS-UNet) to learn an image-based conditional backward process in the latent SHDD space by minimizing a latent KL-divergence loss. To the best of our knowledge, LocDiff is the first image geolocalization model that performs latent diffusion in a multi-scale location encoding space and generates geolocations under the guidance of images. Experimental results show that LocDiff can outperform all state-of-the-art grid-based, retrieval-based, and diffusion-based baselines across 5 challenging global-scale image geolocalization datasets, and demonstrates significantly stronger generalizability to unseen geolocations."

Although improving drones' monitoring and situational awareness, the RID rule also generates significant privacy concerns for UAs' operators, threatened by the ease of tracking of UAs and related confidentiality and privacy concerns connected with the broadcasting of plaintext identity information. In this paper, we propose , a protocol suite for anonymous direct authentication and remote identification of heterogeneous commercial UAs. integrates and adapts protocols for anonymous message signing to work in the UA domain, coping with the constraints of commercial drones and the tight real-time requirements imposed by the RID regulation. Overall, the protocols in the suite allow a UA manufacturer to pick the configuration that best suits the capabilities and constraints of the drone, i.e., either a processing-intensive but memory-lightweight solution (namely, ) or a computationally-friendly but memory-hungry approach (namely, ). Besides formally defining the protocols and formally proving their security in our setting, we also implement and test them on real heterogeneous hardware platforms, i.e., the Holybro X-500 and the ESPcopter, releasing open-source the produced code. For all the protocols, we demonstrated experimentally the capability of generating anonymous RemoteID messages well below the time bound of second required by RID, while at the same time having quite a limited impact on the energy budget of the drone."

    "summary": "Absolute localization, aiming to determine an agent's location with respect to a global reference, is crucial for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in various applications, but it becomes challenging when global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals are unavailable. Vision-based absolute localization methods, which locate the current view of the UAV in a reference satellite map to estimate its position, have become popular in GNSS-denied scenarios. However, existing methods mostly rely on traditional and low-level image matching, suffering from difficulties due to significant differences introduced by cross-source discrepancies and temporal variations. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical cross-source image matching method designed for UAV absolute localization, which integrates a semantic-aware and structure-constrained coarse matching module with a lightweight fine-grained matching module. Specifically, in the coarse matching module, semantic features derived from a vision foundation model first establish region-level correspondences under semantic and structural constraints. Then, the fine-grained matching module is applied to extract fine features and establish pixel-level correspondences. Building upon this, a UAV absolute visual localization pipeline is constructed without any reliance on relative localization techniques, mainly by employing an image retrieval module before the proposed hierarchical image matching modules. Experimental evaluations on public benchmark datasets and a newly introduced CS-UAV dataset demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness of the proposed method under various challenging conditions, confirming its effectiveness."

Observations of key molecules in the grain chemistry such as SiO, CH3OH, SO, CS, H2S, OCS, and SO2 toward this outflow are presented. The line profiles and the derived abundances show three distinct velocity regimes that trace the shock evolution: the preshock, the shock-precursor and the postshock gas. The SiO, CH3OH, SO, and CS abundances are enhanced with respect to the quiescent gas by 1 order of magnitude in the shock-precursor component, and by 3 orders of magnitude in the postshock gas. The derived SiO and CH3OH abundances are consistent with the recent ejection of these molecules from grains. Since H2S is only enhanced in the shock-precursor component, and OCS and SO2 are undetected, SO and CS are the most abundant sulfur-bearing species in the grain mantles of L1448-mm. The ejection of mainly SO and CS rather than H2S or OCS from grains, suggests that the sulfur chemistry will depend on the chemical \"history\" of the grain mantles in outflows and hot cores."

    "summary": "Automated social behaviour analysis of mice has become an increasingly popular research area in behavioural neuroscience. Recently, pose information (i.e., locations of keypoints or skeleton) has been used to interpret social behaviours of mice. Nevertheless, effective encoding and decoding of social interaction information underlying the keypoints of mice has been rarely investigated in the existing methods. In particular, it is challenging to model complex social interactions between mice due to highly deformable body shapes and ambiguous movement patterns. To deal with the interaction modelling problem, we here propose a Cross-Skeleton Interaction Graph Aggregation Network (CS-IGANet) to learn abundant dynamics of freely interacting mice, where a Cross-Skeleton Node-level Interaction module (CS-NLI) is used to model multi-level interactions (i.e., intra-, inter- and cross-skeleton interactions). Furthermore, we design a novel Interaction-Aware Transformer (IAT) to dynamically learn the graph-level representation of social behaviours and update the node-level representation, guided by our proposed interaction-aware self-attention mechanism. Finally, to enhance the representation ability of our model, an auxiliary self-supervised learning task is proposed for measuring the similarity between cross-skeleton nodes. Experimental results on the standard CRMI13-Skeleton and our PDMB-Skeleton datasets show that our proposed model outperforms several other state-of-the-art approaches."

This thesis will present several methods of leveraging machine learning to automatically discover and classify cryptographic algorithms in compiled binary programs.

Currently, these techniques successfully detect and classify cryptographic algorithms in small single-purpose programs, and further work is proposed to apply them to real-world examples."

In the present study, we present a comprehensive analysis of cylindrically symmetric AdS BSs surrounded by CS and QF. Our analysis yields several significant results. We demonstrate that the presence of CS (parameter ) and QF (parameters and ) reduces the radius of circular photon orbits (CPO) and BH shadow size, with measurements constrained by Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sagittarius A*. We find that time-like particle orbits show increased energy with higher and values. We calculate that C-energy, representing gravitational energy within cylindrical radius, decreases with radial distance but exhibits distinct responses to CS and QF parameters. We observe that scalar perturbation potential increases for specific and values, indicating stronger field-spacetime interactions away from the BS. We determine that Hawking temperature increases linearly with Schwarzschild radius, with parameter-dependent behavior varying based on QF state parameter . These results demonstrate how CS and QF significantly modify the geodesic, perturbative, and thermodynamic properties of AdS BS, with potential observational implications for gravitational lensing, accretion disk dynamics, and BH evaporation signatures in future astronomical observations."

    "title": "Iterative Null-space Projection Method with Adaptive Thresholding in Sparse Signal Recovery and Matrix Completion",
    "summary": "Adaptive thresholding methods have proved to yield high SNRs and fast convergence in finding the solution to the Compressed Sensing (CS) problems. Recently, it was observed that the robustness of a class of iterative sparse recovery algorithms such as Iterative Method with Adaptive Thresholding (IMAT) has outperformed the well-known LASSO algorithm in terms of reconstruction quality, convergence speed, and the sensitivity to the noise. In this paper, we introduce a new method towards solving the CS problem. The logic of this method is based on iterative projections of the thresholded signal onto the null-space of the sensing matrix. The thresholding is carried out by recovering the support of the desired signal by projection on thresholding subspaces. The simulations reveal that the proposed method has the capability of yielding noticeable output SNR values with about as many samples as twice the sparsity number, while other methods fail to recover the signals when approaching the algebraic bound for the number of samples required. The computational complexity of our method is also comparable to other methods as observed in the simulations. We have also extended our Algorithm to Matrix Completion (MC) scenarios and compared its efficiency to other well-reputed approaches for MC in the literature."

    "title": "A divide-and-conquer approach for sparse recovery of high dimensional signals",
    "summary": "Compressed sensing (CS) techniques demand significant storage and computational resources, when recovering high-dimensional sparse signals. Block CS (BCS), a special class of CS, addresses both the storage and complexity issues by partitioning the sparse recovery problem into several sub-problems. In this paper, we derive a Welch bound-based guarantee on the reconstruction error with BCS. Our guarantee reveals that the reconstruction quality with BCS monotonically reduces with an increasing number of partitions. To alleviate this performance loss, we propose a sparse recovery technique that exploits correlation across the partitions of the sparse signal. Our method outperforms BCS in the moderate SNR regime, for a modest increase in the storage and computational complexities."

Traditional sampling methods result in very large amounts of data, thus, increasing demands on processing hardware and limiting the exibility in the post-processing stages. In this paper, we apply Compressed Sensing (CS) techniques to analog ultrasound signals, following the recently developed Xampling framework. The result is a system with significantly reduced sampling rates which, in turn, means significantly reduced data size while maintaining the quality of the resulting images."

    "summary": "Kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, and Cs) exhibit a unique superconducting ground state coexisting with charge-density wave (CDW), whereas how these characteristics are affected by carrier doping remains unexplored because of the lack of an efficient carrier-doping method. Here we report successful electron doping to CsV3Sb5 by Cs dosing, as visualized by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We found that the electron doping with Cs dosing proceeds in an orbital-selective way, as characterized by a marked increase in electron filling of the Sb 5pz and V 3dxz/yz bands as opposed to relatively insensitive nature of the V 3dxy/x2-y2 bands. By monitoring the temperature evolution of the CDW gap around the M point, we found that the CDW can be completely killed by Cs dosing while keeping the saddle point with the V 3dxy/x2-y2 character almost pinned at the Fermi level. The present result suggests a crucial role of multi-orbital effect to the occurrence of CDW, and provides an important step toward manipulating the CDW and superconductivity in AV3Sb5."

In bilingual communities, the speakers commonly embed the words and phrases of a non-native language into the syntax of a native language in their day-to-day communications. The code-switching is a global phenomenon among multilingual communities, still very limited acoustic and linguistic resources are available as yet. For developing effective speech based applications, the ability of the existing language technologies to deal with the code-switched data can not be over emphasized. The code-switching is broadly classified into two modes: inter-sentential and intra-sentential code-switching. In this work, we have studied the intra-sentential problem in the context of code-switching language modeling task. The salient contributions of this paper includes: (i) the creation of Hindi-English code-switching text corpus by crawling a few blogging sites educating about the usage of the Internet (ii) the exploration of the parts-of-speech features towards more effective modeling of Hindi-English code-switched data by the monolingual language model (LM) trained on native (Hindi) language data, and (iii) the proposal of a novel textual factor referred to as the code-switch factor (CS-factor), which allows the LM to predict the code-switching instances. In the context of recognition of the code-switching data, the substantial reduction in the PPL is achieved with the use of POS factors and also the proposed CS-factor provides independent as well as additive gain in the PPL."

We assume that a high rate vector quantizer is used to encode the noisy compressive sensing measurement vector. Exploiting a block sparse source model, we use Gaussian mixture density for modeling the distribution of the source. This allows us to formulate an optimal rate allocation problem for the vector quantizer. Considering noisy CS quantized measurements, we analyze upper- and lower-bounds on reconstruction error performance guarantee of two estimators - convex relaxation based basis pursuit de-noising estimator and an oracle-assisted least-squares estimator."

HPC has been widely used in computer science (CS) and other traditionally computation intensive disciplines, but has remained largely siloed away from the vast array of social, behavioral, business and economics disciplines. However, with ubiquitous big data, there is a compelling need to make HPC technologically and economically accessible, easy to use, and operationally democratized. Therefore, this research focuses on making two key contributions, the first is the articulation of strategies based on availability, accessibility and usability for the demystification and democratization of HPC, based on an analytical review of Caliburn, a notable supercomputer at its inception. The second contribution is a set of principles for HPC adoption based on an experiential narrative of HPC usage for textual analytics and NLP of social media data from a first time user perspective. Both, the HPC usage process and the output of the early stage analytics are summarized. This research study synthesizes expert input on HPC democratization strategies, and chronicles the challenges and opportunities from a multidisciplinary perspective, of a case of rapid adoption of supercomputing for textual analytics and NLP. Deductive logic is used to identify strategies which can lead to efficacious engagement, adoption, production and sustained usage for research, teaching, application and innovation by researchers, faculty, professionals and students across a broad range of disciplines."

Such approach reduces the computational burden and makes the implementation process easier (at encoder) plus provides better and more efficient initial reconstruction (at decoder) than other CS techniques. The reconstruction algorithm is based on the combination of the conventional augmented Lagrangian method with variable splitting and alternating direction method and is referred as TV-AL3. The simulation results show that the proposed line based CS scheme not only improves the quality of image by 1dB to ~3dB at various subrates, when compared to the conventional CS schemes but also reduces the computational complexity at the encoder side."

    "title": "Magnetar Giant Flares in Multipolar Magnetic Fields --- II. Flux Rope Eruptions With Current Sheets",
    "summary": "We propose a physical mechanism to explain giant flares and radio afterglows in terms of a magnetospheric model containing both a helically twisted flux rope and a current sheet (CS). With the appearance of CS, we solve a mixed boundary value problem to get the magnetospheric field based on a domain decomposition method. We investigate properties of the equilibrium curve of the flux rope when the CS is present in background multipolar fields. In response to the variations at the magnetar surface, it quasi-statically evolves in stable equilibrium states. The loss of equilibrium occurs at a critical point and, beyond that point, it erupts catastrophically. New features show up when the CS is considered. Especially, we find two kinds of physical behaviors, i.e., catastrophic state transition and catastrophic escape. Magnetic energy would be released during state transitions. The released magnetic energy is sufficient to drive giant flares. The flux rope would go away from the magnetar quasi-statically, which is inconsistent with the radio afterglow. Fortunately, in the latter case, i.e., the catastrophic escape, the flux rope could escape the magnetar and go to infinity in a dynamical way. This is more consistent with radio afterglow observations of giant flares. We find that the minor radius of flux rope has important implications for its eruption. Flux ropes with larger minor radius are more prone to erupt. We stress that the CS provides an ideal place for magnetic reconnection, which would further enhance the energy release during eruptions."

With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), there is a need for AI literacy that goes beyond the traditional AI education curriculum. AI literacy has been conceptualized in various ways, including public literacy, competency building for designers, conceptual understanding of AI concepts, and domain-specific upskilling. Most of these conceptualizations were established before the public release of Generative AI (Gen-AI) tools like ChatGPT. AI education has focused on the principles and applications of AI through a technical lens that emphasizes the mastery of AI principles, the mathematical foundations underlying these technologies, and the programming and mathematical skills necessary to implement AI solutions. In AI Literacy for All, we emphasize a balanced curriculum that includes technical and non-technical learning outcomes to enable a conceptual understanding and critical evaluation of AI technologies in an interdisciplinary socio-technical context. The paper presents four pillars of AI literacy: understanding the scope and technical dimensions of AI, learning how to interact with Gen-AI in an informed and responsible way, the socio-technical issues of ethical and responsible AI, and the social and future implications of AI. While it is important to include all learning outcomes for AI education in a Computer Science major, the learning outcomes can be adjusted for other learning contexts, including, non-CS majors, high school summer camps, the adult workforce, and the public. This paper advocates for a shift in AI literacy education to offer a more interdisciplinary socio-technical approach as a pathway to broaden participation in AI."

    "summary": "Recent advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) often rely on large speech foundation models for generating high-quality transcriptions. However, these models can be impractical due to limited computing resources. The situation is even more severe in terms of more realistic or difficult scenarios, such as code-switching ASR (CS-ASR). To address this, we present a framework for developing more efficient models for CS-ASR through knowledge distillation using realistic speech-only data. Our proposed method, Leave No Knowledge Behind During Knowledge Distillation (K D), leverages both the teacher model's knowledge and additional insights from a small auxiliary model. We evaluate our approach on two in-domain and two out-domain datasets, demonstrating that K D is effective. By conducting K D on the unlabeled realistic data, we have successfully obtained a 2-time smaller model with 5-time faster generation speed while outperforming the baseline methods and the teacher model on all the testing sets. We have made our model publicly available on Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/andybi7676/k2d-whisper.zh-en)."

This new scenario has raised crucial challenges regarding the reliability and trustworthiness of the AI models, as well as about the uncertainties in their response decisions, becoming even more crucial when applied in critical domains such as healthcare, chemical, electrical plants, etc. To contain these issues, in this paper, we present NeuralSentinel (NS), a tool able to validate the reliability and trustworthiness of AI models.

    "title": "Deep De-Aliasing for Fast Compressive Sensing MRI",
    "summary": "Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is highly in demand for many clinical applications in order to reduce the scanning cost and improve the patient experience. This can also potentially increase the image quality by reducing the motion artefacts and contrast washout. However, once an image field of view and the desired resolution are chosen, the minimum scanning time is normally determined by the requirement of acquiring sufficient raw data to meet the Nyquist-Shannon sampling criteria. Compressive Sensing (CS) theory has been perfectly matched to the MRI scanning sequence design with much less required raw data for the image reconstruction. Inspired by recent advances in deep learning for solving various inverse problems, we propose a conditional Generative Adversarial Networks-based deep learning framework for de-aliasing and reconstructing MRI images from highly undersampled data with great promise to accelerate the data acquisition process. By coupling an innovative content loss with the adversarial loss our de-aliasing results are more realistic. Furthermore, we propose a refinement learning procedure for training the generator network, which can stabilise the training with fast convergence and less parameter tuning. We demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art CS-MRI methods, in terms of reconstruction error and perceptual image quality. In addition, our method can reconstruct each image in 0.22ms--0.37ms, which is promising for real-time applications."

For this reason, in this paper, we propose two measures to evaluate the vulnerability of complex networks in two different dynamic multiple failure scenarios: epidemic-like and cascading failures. Firstly, we present epidemic survivability ( ), a new network measure that describes the vulnerability of each node of a network under a specific epidemic intensity. Secondly, we propose cascading survivability ( ), which characterizes how potentially injurious a node is according to a cascading failure scenario. Then, we show that by using the distribution of values obtained from and it is possible to describe the vulnerability of a given network. We consider a set of 17 different complex networks to illustrate the suitability of our proposals. Lastly, results reveal that distinct types of complex networks might react differently under the same multiple failure scenario."

The theory of Compressed Sensing (CS) has been applied recently to the ill-posed inverse problem of recovering images from the measurements taken by radio interferometric telescopes. We review novel CS radio interferometric imaging techniques, both at the level of acquisition and reconstruction, and discuss their superior performance relative to traditional approaches. In order to remain as close to the theory of CS as possible, these techniques necessarily consider idealised interferometric configurations. To realise the enhancement in quality provided by these novel techniques on real radio interferometric observations, their extension to realistic interferometric configurations is now of considerable importance. We also chart the future direction of research required to achieve this goal."

    "summary": "In a structural health monitoring (SHM) system that uses digital cameras to monitor cracks of structural surfaces, techniques for reliable and effective data compression are essential to ensure a stable and energy efficient crack images transmission in wireless devices, e.g., drones and robots with high definition cameras installed. Compressive sensing (CS) is a signal processing technique that allows accurate recovery of a signal from a sampling rate much smaller than the limitation of the Nyquist sampling theorem. The conventional CS method is based on the principle that, through a regularized optimization, the sparsity property of the original signals in some domain can be exploited to get the exact reconstruction with a high probability. However, the strong assumption of the signals being highly sparse in an invertible space is relatively hard for real crack images. In this paper, we present a new approach of CS that replaces the sparsity regularization with a generative model that is able to effectively capture a low dimension representation of targeted images. We develop a recovery framework for automatic crack segmentation of compressed crack images based on this new CS method and demonstrate the remarkable performance of the method taking advantage of the strong capability of generative models to capture the necessary features required in the crack segmentation task even the backgrounds of the generated images are not well reconstructed. The superior performance of our recovery framework is illustrated by comparing with three existing CS algorithms. Furthermore, we show that our framework is extensible to other common problems in automatic crack segmentation, such as defect recovery from motion blurring and occlusion."

Today the de facto standard for such reconstruction is compressed sensing. CS produces high quality images (with minimal perceptual loss, but such reconstructions are time consuming, requiring solving a complex optimization problem. In this work we propose to learn the reconstruction from training samples using an autoencoder. Our work is based on the universal function approximation capacity of neural networks. The training time for the autoencoder is large, but is offline and hence does not affect performance during operation. During testing or operation, our method requires only a few matrix vector products and hence is significantly faster than CS based methods. In fact, it is fast enough for real-time reconstruction the images are reconstructed as fast as they are acquired with only slight degradation of image quality. However, in order to make the autoencoder suitable for our problem, we depart from the standard Euclidean norm cost function of autoencoders and use a robust l1-norm instead. The ensuing problem is solved using the Split Bregman method."

However, its high melting point and inherent brittleness pose significant challenges for processing using additive manufacturing (AM). Cold spray (CS), a solid-state AM process that relies on high-velocity particle impact and plastic deformation, offers a promising alternative. In this study, we employ atomistic simulations to investigate the feasibility of CS for tungsten. We show that ultrasound perturbation can significantly enhance the self-diffusivity and plastic deformation of compared to the negligible diffusion and plastic deformation observed in non-ultrasound-assisted CS of . For different impact velocities, particle sizes, and ultrasound parameters, we demonstrate that ultrasound-assisted viscoplasticity enhances self-diffusivity by inhibiting grain boundaries and incorporating softening in . Moreover, we found that this enhanced diffusion in ultrasound-assisted can be exploited to promote interdiffusion at the particle-substrate interface, enabling in situ alloy formation. Through the formation of an equimolar - alloy on a substrate using ultrasound-assisted CS simulations, we observed distinct mechanical properties and a reduced dislocation density in the deposited coating compared to a pure tungsten substrate. These results highlight the potential of ultrasound-assisted CS as a viable approach for manufacturing uniform coatings and engineered alloys, addressing key limitations in the AM of refractory metals."

    "summary": "Many interesting problems in fields ranging from telecommunications to computational biology can be formalized in terms of large underdetermined systems of linear equations with additional constraints or regularizers. One of the most studied ones, the Compressed Sensing problem (CS), consists in finding the solution with the smallest number of non-zero components of a given system of linear equations for known measurement vector and sensing matrix . Here, we will address the compressed sensing problem within a Bayesian inference framework where the sparsity constraint is remapped into a singular prior distribution (called Spike-and-Slab or Bernoulli-Gauss). Solution to the problem is attempted through the computation of marginal distributions via Expectation Propagation (EP), an iterative computational scheme originally developed in Statistical Physics. We will show that this strategy is comparatively more accurate than the alternatives in solving instances of CS generated from statistically correlated measurement matrices. For computational strategies based on the Bayesian framework such as variants of Belief Propagation, this is to be expected, as they implicitly rely on the hypothesis of statistical independence among the entries of the sensing matrix. Perhaps surprisingly, the method outperforms uniformly also all the other state-of-the-art methods in our tests."

Two different models, previously used for the same purpose, are considered to describe the matter density profile of the void: a top hat function and a compensated profile produced by a Gaussian potential. The analysis shows that, even enabling ellipticity changes or different values for the dark-energy equation of state parameter , the ISW contribution due to the presence of the void does not reproduce the properties of the CS.

For the first time, we consistently compute the generation of gravitational waves from extreme-mass ratio inspirals (stellar compact objects into supermassive black holes) in a well-motivated alternative theory of gravity, that to date remains weakly constrained by double binary pulsar observations. The theory we concentrate on is Chern-Simons (CS) modified gravity, a 4-D, effective theory that is motivated both from string theory and loop-quantum gravity, and which enhances the Einstein-Hilbert action through the addition of a dynamical scalar field and the parity-violating Pontryagin density. We show that although point particles continue to follow geodesics in the modified theory, the background about which they inspiral is a modification to the Kerr metric, which imprints a CS correction on the gravitational waves emitted. CS modified gravitational waves are sufficiently different from the General Relativistic expectation that they lead to significant dephasing after 3 weeks of evolution, but such dephasing will probably not prevent detection of these signals, but instead lead to a systematic error in the determination of parameters. We end with a study of radiation-reaction in the modified theory and show that, to leading-order, energy-momentum emission is not CS modified, except possibly for the subdominant effect of scalar-field emission. The inclusion of radiation-reaction will allow for tests of CS modified gravity with space-borne detectors that might be two orders of magnitude larger than current binary pulsar bounds."

    "summary": "Channel estimation is a critical task in digital communications that greatly impacts end-to-end system performance. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation using score-based generative models. Our method uses a deep neural network that is trained to estimate the gradient of the log-prior of wireless channels at any point in high-dimensional space, and leverages this model to solve channel estimation via posterior sampling. We train a score-based model on channel realizations from the CDL-D model for two antenna spacings and show that the approach leads to competitive in- and out-of-distribution performance when compared to generative adversarial network (GAN) and compressed sensing (CS) methods. When tested on CDL-D channels, the approach leads to a gain of at least dB in channel estimation error compared to GAN methods in-distribution at antenna spacing. When tested on CDL-C channels which are never seen during training or fine-tuned on, the approach leads to end-to-end coded performance gains of up to dB compared to CS methods and losses of only dB compared to ideal channel knowledge."

    "summary": "In this paper we offer a complete methodology for sufficient dimension reduction called the test function (TF). TF provides a new family of methods for the estimation of the central subspace (CS) based on the introduction of a nonlinear transformation of the response. Theoretical background of TF is developed under weaker conditions than the existing methods. By considering order 1 and 2 conditional moments of the predictor given the response, we divide TF in two classes. In each class we provide conditions that guarantee an exhaustive estimation of the CS. Besides, the optimal members are calculated via the minimization of the asymptotic mean squared error deriving from the distance between the CS and its estimate. This leads us to two plug-in methods which are evaluated with several simulations."

To address the formulated joint learning problem, we propose an online algorithm that consists of a closed-form solution for optimizing the sensing matrix with a fixed sparsifying dictionary and a stochastic method for learning the sparsifying dictionary on a large dataset when the sensing matrix is given. Benefiting from training on a large dataset, the obtained compressive sensing (CS) system by the proposed algorithm yields a much better performance in terms of signal recovery accuracy than the existing ones. The simulation results on natural images demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested online algorithm compared with the existing methods."

The new induction equation for the magnetic field, which accounts for this inhomogeneity, is derived for such systems. Based on this equation, we study, first, the evolution of two Chern-Simons (CS) waves interacting with a linearly decreasing pseudoscalar field. The nonzero gradient of the pseudoscalar field results in the mixing between these CS waves. Then, we consider the problem in a compact domain, when an initial CS wave is mirror symmetric. In this situation, the inhomogeneity of a pseudoscalar field acts as the effective modification of the -dynamo parameter. Thus, we conclude that the influence of a spatially inhomogeneous pseudoscalar field on the magnetic field evolution strongly depends on the geometry of the system."

We detect absorption lines from C I, C II, O I, Mg II, Al II, Si II, S II, Mn II, Fe II, and marginally N I. The lines show two clear absorption components at km s and km s , which we attribute to circumstellar (CS) and interstellar (IS) gas, respectively. CO absorption is not detected, and we find no evidence for star-grazing exocomets. The CS absorption components are blueshifted by km s in the star's reference frame, indicating that they are outflowing in a radiatively driven disk wind. We find that the C/Fe ratio in the Tel CS gas is significantly higher than the solar ratio, as is the case in the Pic and 49 Cet debris disks. Unlike those disks, however, the measured C/O ratio in the Tel CS gas is consistent with the solar value. Our analysis shows that because Tel is an earlier type star than Pic and 49 Cet, with more substantial radiation pressure at the dominant C II transitions, this species cannot bind the CS gas disk to the star as it does for Pic and 49 Cet, resulting in the disk wind."

Here we propose a deep learning framework for 'Flow Reconstruction and Segmentation for low latency Cardiac Output monitoring' (FReSCO). Methods: Deep artifact suppression and segmentation U-Nets were independently trained. Breath hold spiral PCMR data (n=516) was synthetically undersampled using a variable density spiral sampling pattern and gridded to create aliased data for training of the artifact suppression U-net. A subset of the data (n=96) was segmented and used to train the segmentation U-net. Real-time spiral PCMR was prospectively acquired and then reconstructed and segmented using the trained models (FReSCO) at low latency at the scanner in 10 healthy subjects during rest, exercise and recovery periods. CO obtained via FReSCO was compared to a reference rest CO and rest and exercise Compressed Sensing (CS) CO. Results: FReSCO was demonstrated prospectively at the scanner. Beat-to-beat heartrate, stroke volume and CO could be visualized with a mean latency of 622ms. No significant differences were noted when compared to reference at rest (Bias = -0.21+-0.50 L/min, p=0.246) or CS at peak exercise (Bias=0.12+-0.48 L/min, p=0.458).

Embedding algebra for the BEGOE(2)- ensemble and also for BEGOE(1+2)- that includes the mean-field one-body part is with SU(2) generating spin. A method for constructing the ensembles in fixed-( ) spaces has been developed. Numerical calculations show that for BEGOE(2)- , the fixed- density of states is close to Gaussian and level fluctuations follow GOE in the dense limit. For BEGOE(1+2)- , generically there is Poisson to GOE transition in level fluctuations as the interaction strength (measured in the units of the average spacing of the single particle levels defining the mean-field) is increased. The interaction strength needed for the onset of the transition is found to decrease with increasing . Covariances in energy centroids and spectral variances are analyzed. Propagation formula is derived for the variance propagator for the fixed- ensemble averaged spectral variances. Variance propagator clearly shows, by applying the Jacquod and Stone prescription, that the BEGOE(2)- ensemble generates ground states with spin . This is further corroborated by analyzing the structure of the ground states in the presence of the exchange interaction in BEGOE(1+2)- . Natural spin ordering is also observed with random interactions. Going beyond these, we also introduce pairing symmetry in the space defined by BEGOE(2)- . Expectation values of the pairing Hamiltonian show that random interactions exhibit pairing correlations in the ground state region."

At , the CS model describes a free non-relativistic fermion, or boson theory, while for generic , the system can be interpreted either as interacting fermions or bosons, or free anyons depending on the context. However, we shall show in this letter that the fermionic picture is advantageous in diagonalizing the CS Hamiltonian. Comparing to the previously known multi-integral representation or the Dunkl operator formalism for the CS wave functions, our method depends on the (upper or lower) triangular nature of the fermion interaction, which is resolved in perturbation theory of the second quantized form. The eigenstate is constructed from a multiplet of unperturbed states and the perturbation is of finite order. The full construction is a similarity transformation from the free fermion theory, in the same spirit as the Landau Fermi liquid theory and the 1d Luttinger liquid theory. That means quasi-particles or anyons can be represented in terms of free fermion modes (or bosonic modes via bosonization). The method is applicable to other (higher than one space dimension) systems for which the adiabatic theorem applies."

Going beyond the conventional two-terminal approach, transport calculations provide a comprehensive understanding of the subtle interplay between the graphene electrode coupling and the observation of graphene phonon spectroscopic signatures."

    "title": "Nest-DGIL: Nesterov-optimized Deep Geometric Incremental Learning for CS Image Reconstruction",
    "summary": "Proximal gradient-based optimization is one of the most common strategies to solve inverse problem of images, and it is easy to implement. However, these techniques often generate heavy artifacts in image reconstruction. One of the most popular refinement methods is to fine-tune the regularization parameter to alleviate such artifacts, but it may not always be sufficient or applicable due to increased computational costs. In this work, we propose a deep geometric incremental learning framework based on the second Nesterov proximal gradient optimization. The proposed end-to-end network not only has the powerful learning ability for high-/low-frequency image features, but also can theoretically guarantee that geometric texture details will be reconstructed from preliminary linear reconstruction. Furthermore, it can avoid the risk of intermediate reconstruction results falling outside the geometric decomposition domains and achieve fast convergence. Our reconstruction framework is decomposed into four modules including general linear reconstruction, cascade geometric incremental restoration, Nesterov acceleration, and post-processing. In the image restoration step, a cascade geometric incremental learning module is designed to compensate for missing texture information from different geometric spectral decomposition domains. Inspired by the overlap-tile strategy, we also develop a post-processing module to remove the block effect in patch-wise-based natural image reconstruction. All parameters in the proposed model are learnable, an adaptive initialization technique of physical parameters is also employed to make model flexibility and ensure converging smoothly. We compare the reconstruction performance of the proposed method with existing state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate its superiority.

    "title": "A Hybrid Q-Learning Sine-Cosine-based Strategy for Addressing the Combinatorial Test Suite Minimization Problem",
    "summary": "The sine-cosine algorithm (SCA) is a new population-based meta-heuristic algorithm. In addition to exploiting sine and cosine functions to perform local and global searches (hence the name sine-cosine), the SCA introduces several random and adaptive parameters to facilitate the search process. Although it shows promising results, the search process of the SCA is vulnerable to local minima/maxima due to the adoption of a fixed switch probability and the bounded magnitude of the sine and cosine functions (from -1 to 1). In this paper, we propose a new hybrid Q-learning sine-cosine- based strategy, called the Q-learning sine-cosine algorithm (QLSCA). Within the QLSCA, we eliminate the switching probability. Instead, we rely on the Q-learning algorithm (based on the penalty and reward mechanism) to dynamically identify the best operation during runtime. Additionally, we integrate two new operations (Lévy flight motion and crossover) into the QLSCA to facilitate jumping out of local minima/maxima and enhance the solution diversity. To assess its performance, we adopt the QLSCA for the combinatorial test suite minimization problem. Experimental results reveal that the QLSCA is statistically superior with regard to test suite size reduction compared to recent state-of-the-art strategies, including the original SCA, the particle swarm test generator (PSTG), adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) and the cuckoo search strategy (CS) at the 95% confidence level. However, concerning the comparison with discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO), there is no significant difference in performance at the 95% confidence level. On a positive note, the QLSCA statistically outperforms the DPSO in certain configurations at the 90% confidence level."

The use of such reconstruction methods is motivated by recent progress in compressed sensing (CS). However, the CS framework provides neither guarantees of accurate CT reconstruction, nor any relation between sparsity and a sufficient number of measurements for recovery, i.e., perfect reconstruction from noise-free data. We consider reconstruction through 1-norm minimization, as proposed in CS, from data obtained using a standard CT fan-beam sampling pattern. In empirical simulation studies we establish quantitatively a relation between the image sparsity and the sufficient number of measurements for recovery within image classes motivated by tomographic applications. We show empirically that the specific relation depends on the image class and in many cases exhibits a sharp phase transition as seen in CS, i.e. same-sparsity image require the same number of projections for recovery. Finally we demonstrate that the relation holds independently of image size and is robust to small amounts of additive Gaussian noise."

Off-the-shelf MIL algorithms are typically deployed on a single-scale of WSIs (e.g., 20x magnification), while human pathologists usually aggregate the global and local patterns in a multi-scale manner (e.g., by zooming in and out between different magnifications).

In this paper, we propose a new surrogate model that provides efficient prediction and uncertainty quantification of turbulent flows in swirl injectors with varying geometries, devices commonly used in many engineering applications. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the incorporation of known physical properties of the fluid flow as simplifying assumptions for the statistical model. In view of the massive simulation data at hand, which is on the order of hundreds of gigabytes, these assumptions allow for accurate flow predictions in around an hour of computation time. To contrast, existing flow emulators which forgo such simplications may require more computation time for training and prediction than is needed for conducting the simulation itself. Moreover, by accounting for coupling mechanisms between flow variables, the proposed model can jointly reduce prediction uncertainty and extract useful flow physics, which can then be used to guide further investigations."

In precisely reconstructing the coherent cavity field amplitudes, we have to prepare the same states repetitively and each time perform one measurement with short sampling intervals considering the quantum nature of measurement and the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. However, with the help of CS, the number of measurements can be exponentially reduced without loss of the recovery accuracy. We use largely detuned atoms and control their interactions with the cavity field to modulate coherent state amplitudes according to the scheme encoded in the sensing matrix. The simulation results show that the CS method efficiently recovers the amplitudes of the coherent cavity field even in the presence of noise."

By embedding data-driven surrogate models into the mathematical optimization structure, the proposed methodology addresses key limitations of conventional superstructure-based approaches, enabling simultaneous optimization of discrete process choices and continuous operating parameters. The framework captures variable input and output stream compositions, facilitating the joint optimization of target product composition and system design. Application to Fischer-Tropsch (FT) kerosene production demonstrates that cost-minimizing configurations under unconstrained CO2 emissions are dominated by the fossil-based autothermal reforming (ATR) route. Imposing carbon emission constraints necessitates the integration of biomass gasification and direct air capture coupled with carbon sequestration (DAC-CS), resulting in substantially reduced net emissions but higher production costs. At the zero-emission limit, hybrid configurations combining ATR and biomass gasification achieve the lowest costs (~2.38 \\ /kg), both of which outperform the ATR-only pathway with DAC-CS (~2.65 \\ /kg). The results highlight the critical role of the embedded ANNs: optimal process conditions, such as FT reactor pressure and gasification temperature, adapt to changing circumstances, consistently outperforming fixed setups and achieving up to 20% cost savings."

    "summary": "Double-reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technique, achieving a substantial gain improvement compared to single-RIS techniques. However, in double-RIS-aided systems, accurate channel estimation is more challenging than in single-RIS-aided systems. This work solves the problem of double-RIS-based channel estimation based on active RIS architectures with only one radio frequency (RF) chain. Since the slow time-varying channels, i.e., the BS-RIS 1, BS-RIS 2, and RIS 1-RIS 2 channels, can be obtained with active RIS architectures, a novel multi-user two-timescale channel estimation protocol is proposed to minimize the pilot overhead. First, we propose an uplink training scheme for slow time-varying channel estimation, which can effectively address the double-reflection channel estimation problem. With channels' sparisty, a low-complexity Singular Value Decomposition Multiple Measurement Vector-Based Compressive Sensing (SVD-MMV-CS) framework with the line-of-sight (LoS)-aided off-grid MMV expectation maximization-based generalized approximate message passing (M-EM-GAMP) algorithm is proposed for channel parameter recovery. For fast time-varying channel estimation, based on the estimated large-timescale channels, a measurements-augmentation-estimate (MAE) framework is developed to decrease the pilot overhead.Additionally, a comprehensive analysis of pilot overhead and computing complexity is conducted. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed multi-user two-timescale estimation strategy and the low-complexity Bayesian CS framework."

    "summary": "The Turing Award is recognized as the most influential and prestigious award in the field of computer science(CS). With the rise of the science of science (SciSci), a large amount of bibliographic data has been analyzed in an attempt to understand the hidden mechanism of scientific evolution. These include the analysis of the Nobel Prize, including physics, chemistry, medicine, etc. In this article, we extract and analyze the data of 72 Turing Award laureates from the complete bibliographic data, fill the gap in the lack of Turing Award analysis, and discover the development characteristics of computer science as an independent discipline. First, we show most Turing Award laureates have long-term and high-quality educational backgrounds, and more than 61% of them have a degree in mathematics, which indicates that mathematics has played a significant role in the development of computer science. Secondly, the data shows that not all scholars have high productivity and high h-index; that is, the number of publications and h-index is not the leading indicator for evaluating the Turing Award. Third, the average age of awardees has increased from 40 to around 70 in recent years. This may be because new breakthroughs take longer, and some new technologies need time to prove their influence. Besides, we have also found that in the past ten years, international collaboration has experienced explosive growth, showing a new paradigm in the form of collaboration. It is also worth noting that in recent years, the emergence of female winners has also been eye-catching. Finally, by analyzing the personal publication records, we find that many people are more likely to publish high-impact articles during their high-yield periods."

The current sheet (CS) evolution during the MFR formation and eruption process in our MHD simulation can be divided into four stages. The current sheet (CS) evolution during the MFR formation and eruption process in our MHD simulation can be divided into four stages. The first stage shows the CS forming and gradually lengthening. Resistive instabilities that disrupt the CS mark the beginning of the second stage. Magnetic islands disappear in the third stage and reappear in the fourth stage. Synthetic images and light curves of the seven Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) channels, i.e., 9.4 nm, 13.1 nm, 17.1 nm, 19.3 nm, 21.1 nm, 30.4 nm, and 33.5 nm, and the 3-25 keV thermal X-ray are obtained with forward-modeling analysis. The loop-top source and the coronal sources of the soft X-ray are reproduced in forward modeling. The light curves of the seven SDO/AIA channels start to rise once resistive instabilities develop. The light curve of the 3-25 keV thermal X-ray starts to go up when the reconnection rate reaches one of its peaks. Quasiperiodic pulsations (QPPs) appear twice in the SDO/AIA 17.1 nm, 21.1 nm, and 30.4 nm channels, corresponding to the period of chaotic (re)appearance and CS-guided displacements of the magnetic islands. QPPs appear once in the SDO/AIA 9.4 nm and 33.5 nm channels after the disruption of the CS by resistive instabilities and in the 19.3 nm channel when the chaotic motion of the magnetic islands reappears."

    "summary": "Deep learning (DL) is transforming industry as decision-making processes are being automated by deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on real-world data. Driven partly by rapidly-expanding literature on DNN approximation theory showing they can approximate a rich variety of functions, such tools are increasingly being considered for problems in scientific computing. Yet, unlike traditional algorithms in this field, little is known about DNNs from the principles of numerical analysis, e.g., stability, accuracy, computational efficiency and sample complexity. In this paper we introduce a computational framework for examining DNNs in practice, and use it to study empirical performance with regard to these issues. We study performance of DNNs of different widths & depths on test functions in various dimensions, including smooth and piecewise smooth functions. We also compare DL against best-in-class methods for smooth function approx. based on compressed sensing (CS). Our main conclusion from these experiments is that there is a crucial gap between the approximation theory of DNNs and their practical performance, with trained DNNs performing relatively poorly on functions for which there are strong approximation results (e.g. smooth functions), yet performing well in comparison to best-in-class methods for other functions. To analyze this gap further, we provide some theoretical insights. We establish a practical existence theorem, asserting existence of a DNN architecture and training procedure that offers the same performance as CS. This establishes a key theoretical benchmark, showing the gap can be closed, albeit via a strategy guaranteed to perform as well as, but no better than, current best-in-class schemes. Nevertheless, it demonstrates the promise of practical DNN approx., by highlighting potential for better schemes through careful design of DNN architectures and training strategies."

    "summary": "The computing ecosystem has always had deep impacts on society and technology and profoundly changed our lives in myriads of ways. Despite decades of impressive Moore's Law performance scaling and other growth in the computing ecosystem there are nonetheless still important potential applications of computing that remain out of reach of current or foreseeable conventional computer systems. Specifically, there are computational applications whose complexity scales super-linearly, even exponentially, with the size of their input data such that the computation time or memory requirements for these problems become intractably large to solve for useful data input sizes. Such problems can have memory requirements that exceed what can be built on the most powerful supercomputers, and/or runtimes on the order of tens of years or more. Quantum computing (QC) is viewed by many as a possible future option for tackling these high-complexity or seemingly-intractable problems by complementing classical computing with a fundamentally different compute paradigm. There is a huge gap between the problems for which a quantum computer might be useful and what we can currently build, program, and run. The goal of the QC research community is to close the gap such that useful algorithms can be run in practical amounts of time on reliable real-world QC hardware. In particular, the goal of this Computing Community Consortium (CCC) workshop was to articulate the central role that the computer science (CS) research communities plays in closing this gap. CS researchers bring invaluable expertise in the design of programming languages, in techniques for systems building, scalability and verification, and in architectural approaches that can bring practical QC from the future to the present. This report introduces issues and recommendations across a range of technical and non-technical topic areas."

In the case of a residual symmetry, radiative corrections do not change the coefficient of the term. In the case of an unbroken non-abelian subgroup, the coefficient of the relevant term (suitably normalized) attains an integral correction, as required for consistency of the quantum theory. Interestingly, this coefficient arises purely from the unbroken non-abelian sector in question; the orthogonal sector makes no contribution. This implies that the coefficient of the term is a discontinuous function over the phase diagram of the theory."

    "summary": "The pure CsPbBr perovskite is an archetypal example of a strongly anharmonic crystal that poses a major challenge for computational methods to describe its thermodynamic properties. Its lattice dynamics exhibits characteristics of a phonon liquid: mode coupling, low lifetimes and `rattlers'. To study the thermal conduction in this crystal, including the effect of dynamic disorder introduced by the Cs rattlers, we apply large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with machine-learning interatomic potentials. We simulate its ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity in the cubic phase and obtain phonon spectra by measuring velocity autocorrelation functions. The thermal conductivity at 500 K is computed to be , which is similar to that of demineralized water under normal indoor conditions. MD based insight into the heat transport mechanism of halide perovskites is presented. In the analysis the Cs cations are interpreted as damped Einstein oscillators. The phonon bandstructure of a system with artificially raised Cs masses demonstrates an increased interference of the Cs rattling with the acoustic phonon modes. We show that the thermal conductivity of the CsPbBr perovskite can still be slightly decreased by tuning the cation rattling frequency into the range of the low lying acoustic mode"

More attention is paid to employing GCN in Skeleton-Based action recognition. But existing methods based on GCNs have two problems. First, the consistency of temporal and spatial features is ignored for extracting features node by node and frame by frame. To obtain spatiotemporal features simultaneously, we design a generic representation of skeleton sequences for action recognition and propose a novel model called Temporal Graph Networks (TGN). Secondly, the adjacency matrix of the graph describing the relation of joints is mostly dependent on the physical connection between joints. To appropriately describe the relations between joints in the skeleton graph, we propose a multi-scale graph strategy, adopting a full-scale graph, part-scale graph, and core-scale graph to capture the local features of each joint and the contour features of important joints. Experiments were carried out on two large datasets and results show that TGN with our graph strategy outperforms state-of-the-art methods."

    "title": "Lorentzian Iterative Hard Thresholding: Robust Compressed Sensing with Prior Information",
    "summary": "Commonly employed reconstruction algorithms in compressed sensing (CS) use the norm as the metric for the residual error. However, it is well-known that least squares (LS) based estimators are highly sensitive to outliers present in the measurement vector leading to a poor performance when the noise no longer follows the Gaussian assumption but, instead, is better characterized by heavier-than-Gaussian tailed distributions. In this paper, we propose a robust iterative hard Thresholding (IHT) algorithm for reconstructing sparse signals in the presence of impulsive noise. To address this problem, we use a Lorentzian cost function instead of the cost function employed by the traditional IHT algorithm. We also modify the algorithm to incorporate prior signal information in the recovery process. Specifically, we study the case of CS with partially known support. The proposed algorithm is a fast method with computational load comparable to the LS based IHT, whilst having the advantage of robustness against heavy-tailed impulsive noise. Sufficient conditions for stability are studied and a reconstruction error bound is derived. We also derive sufficient conditions for stable sparse signal recovery with partially known support. Theoretical analysis shows that including prior support information relaxes the conditions for successful reconstruction. Simulation results demonstrate that the Lorentzian-based IHT algorithm significantly outperform commonly employed sparse reconstruction techniques in impulsive environments, while providing comparable performance in less demanding, light-tailed environments. Numerical results also demonstrate that the partially known support inclusion improves the performance of the proposed algorithm, thereby requiring fewer samples to yield an approximate reconstruction."

    "summary": "With the proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs), the transportation network and power grid become increasingly interdependent and coupled via charging stations. The concomitant growth in charging demand has posed challenges for both networks, highlighting the importance of charging coordination. Existing literature largely overlooks the interactions between power grid security and traffic efficiency. In view of this, we study the en-route charging station (CS) recommendation problem for EVs in dynamically coupled transportation-power systems. The system-level objective is to maximize the overall traffic efficiency while ensuring the safety of the power grid. This problem is for the first time formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), and an online prediction-assisted safe reinforcement learning (OP-SRL) method is proposed to learn the optimal and secure policy by extending the PPO method. To be specific, we mainly address two challenges. First, the constrained optimization problem is converted into an equivalent unconstrained optimization problem by applying the Lagrangian method. Second, to account for the uncertain long-time delay between performing CS recommendation and commencing charging, we put forward an online sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) predictor for state augmentation to guide the agent in making forward-thinking decisions. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experimental studies based on the Nguyen-Dupuis network and a large-scale real-world road network, coupled with IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 69-bus distribution systems, respectively. Results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baselines in terms of road network efficiency, power grid safety, and EV user satisfaction. The case study on the real-world network also illustrates the applicability in the practical context."

Here, we constructed an experimental model that simulates an optical cat state by engineering the classical orbital angular momentum of light, referred to here as an analogous cat state (a-CS). In our scheme, the behaviors of the a-CS in position space show many similarities to the quantum version of the optical cat state in phase space, for example, movement, rotation, and interference. Experimentally, the a-CS, which has two spatially localized Gaussian intensity lobes, can be evolved from \"kitten\" to \"cat\" by engineering the acquired phase hologram. Additionally, we simulated the \"decoherence\" of the a-CS influenced by atmospheric turbulence. The a-CS provides a reliable tool for visualizing and studying the behaviors of quantum cat states in phase space."

    "summary": "Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has shown great clinical value and has been widely used in deep learning (DL) based computer-aided brain disease diagnosis. Previous approaches focused on local shapes and textures in sMRI that may be significant only within a particular domain. The learned representations are likely to contain spurious information and have a poor generalization ability in other diseases and datasets. To facilitate capturing meaningful and robust features, it is necessary to first comprehensively understand the intrinsic pattern of the brain that is not restricted within a single data/task domain. Considering that the brain is a complex connectome of interlinked neurons, the connectional properties in the brain have strong biological significance, which is shared across multiple domains and covers most pathological information. In this work, we propose a connectional style contextual representation learning model (CS-CRL) to capture the intrinsic pattern of the brain, used for multiple brain disease diagnosis. Specifically, it has a vision transformer (ViT) encoder and leverages mask reconstruction as the proxy task and Gram matrices to guide the representation of connectional information. It facilitates the capture of global context and the aggregation of features with biological plausibility. The results indicate that CS-CRL achieves superior accuracy in multiple brain disease diagnosis tasks across six datasets and three diseases and outperforms state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CS-CRL captures more brain-network-like properties, better aggregates features, is easier to optimize and is more robust to noise, which explains its superiority in theory. Our source code will be released soon."

Our proposal lies on considering the CS term as a source of torsion and on an iterative procedure to look for vacuum solutions of the system, by expanding the tetrad, the connection and the embedding parameter, in powers of a dimensionless small parameter which codifies the CS coupling. Starting from a torsionless zeroth-order vacuum solution we derive the second-order differential equation for the corrections to the metric, for an arbitrary embedding parameter. Furthermore we can show that the slowly rotating Kerr metric is an solution of the system either in the canonical or the axial embeddings."

    "summary": "In mammography, the efficacy of computer-aided detection methods depends, in part, on the robust localisation of micro-calcifications ( C). Currently, the most effective methods are based on three steps: 1) detection of individual C candidates, 2) clustering of individual C candidates, and 3) classification of C clusters. Where the second step is motivated both to reduce the number of false positive detections from the first step and on the evidence that malignancy depends on a relatively large number of C detections within a certain area. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to C detection, consisting of the detection and classification of individual C candidates, using shape and appearance features, using a cascade of boosting classifiers. The final step in our approach then clusters the remaining individual C candidates. The main advantage of this approach lies in its ability to reject a significant number of false positive C candidates compared to previously proposed methods. Specifically, on the INbreast dataset, we show that our approach has a true positive rate (TPR) for individual Cs of 40\\% at one false positive per image (FPI) and a TPR of 80\\% at 10 FPI. These results are significantly more accurate than the current state of the art, which has a TPR of less than 1\\% at one FPI and a TPR of 10\\% at 10 FPI. Our results are competitive with the state of the art at the subsequent stage of detecting clusters of Cs."

At high precision where more bits (e.g. 64) are allocated to each number, round-off errors are typically small. On the other hand, calculating at lower precision, such as half (16 bits), has the advantage of being much faster. This research focuses on experimenting with arithmetic at different precision levels for large-scale inverse problems, which are represented by linear systems with ill-conditioned matrices. We modified the Conjugate Gradient Method for Least Squares (CGLS) and the Chebyshev Semi-Iterative Method (CS) with Tikhonov regularization to do arithmetic at lower precision using the MATLAB chop function, and we ran experiments on applications from image processing and compared their performance at different precision levels. We concluded that CGLS is a more stable algorithm, but overflows easily due to the computation of inner products, while CS is less likely to overflow but it has more erratic convergence behavior. When the noise level is high, CS outperforms CGLS by being able to run more iterations before overflow occurs; when the noise level is close to zero, CS appears to be more susceptible to accumulation of round-off errors."

    "summary": "We study the renormalizable abelian vector-field models in the presence of the Wess-Zumino interaction with the pseudoscalar matter. The renormalizability is achieved by supplementing the standard kinetic term of vector fields with higher derivatives. The appearance of fourth power of momentum in the vector-field propagator leads to the super-renormalizable theory in which the -function, the vector-field renormalization constant and the anomalous mass dimension are calculated exactly. It is shown that this model has the infrared stable fixed point and its low-energy limit is non-trivial. The modified effective potential for the pseudoscalar matter leads to the possible occurrence of dynamical breaking of the Lorentz symmetry. This phenomenon is related to the modification of Electrodynamics by means of the Chern-Simons (CS) interaction polarized along a constant CS vector. Its presence makes the vacuum optically active that has been recently estimated from astrophysical data. We examine two possibilities for the CS vector to be time-like or space-like, under the assumption that it originates from v.e.v. of some pseudoscalar matter and show that only the latter one is consistent in the framework of the AWZ model, because a time-like CS vector makes the vacuum unstable under pairs creation of tachyonic photon modes with the finite vacuum decay rate."

Therefore, it takes a long time to collect the training data of each user for calibration. Even transfer learning method pre-training with amounts of subject-independent data cannot decode different EEG signal categories without enough subject-specific data. Hence, we proposed a cross-subject EEG classification framework with a generative adversarial networks (GANs) based method named common spatial GAN (CS-GAN), which used adversarial training between a generator and a discriminator to obtain high-quality data for augmentation. A particular module in the discriminator was employed to maintain the spatial features of the EEG signals and increase the difference between different categories, with two losses for further enhancement. Through adaptive training with sufficient augmentation data, our cross-subject classification accuracy yielded a significant improvement of 15.85% than leave-one subject-out (LOO) test and 8.57% than just adapting 100 original samples on the dataset 2a of BCI competition IV. Moreover, We designed a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based classification method as a benchmark with a similar spatial enhancement idea, which achieved remarkable results to classify motor imagery EEG data. In summary, our framework provides a promising way to deal with the cross-subject problem and promote the practical application of BCI."

By presenting the model with the exam's open and multiple-choice questions in their original image format and allowing for reassessment in response to differing answer keys, we were able to evaluate the model's reasoning and self-reflecting capabilities in a large-scale academic assessment involving textual and visual content. ChatGPT-4 Vision significantly outperformed the average exam participant, positioning itself within the top 10 best score percentile.

Multiple deep learning-based structures have been proposed for MRI reconstruction using CS, both in the k-space and image domains as well as using unrolled optimization methods. However, the drawback of these structures is that they are not fully utilizing the information from both domains (k-space and image).

    "summary": "Purpose: Compressed sensing MRI (CS-MRI) from single and parallel coils is one of the powerful ways to reduce the scan time of MR imaging with performance guarantee. However, the computational costs are usually expensive. This paper aims to propose a computationally fast and accurate deep learning algorithm for the reconstruction of MR images from highly down-sampled k-space data. Theory: Based on the topological analysis, we show that the data manifold of the aliasing artifact is easier to learn from a uniform subsampling pattern with additional low-frequency k-space data. Thus, we develop deep aliasing artifact learning networks for the magnitude and phase images to estimate and remove the aliasing artifacts from highly accelerated MR acquisition. Methods: The aliasing artifacts are directly estimated from the distorted magnitude and phase images reconstructed from subsampled k-space data so that we can get an aliasing-free images by subtracting the estimated aliasing artifact from corrupted inputs. Moreover, to deal with the globally distributed aliasing artifact, we develop a multi-scale deep neural network with a large receptive field. Results: The experimental results confirm that the proposed deep artifact learning network effectively estimates and removes the aliasing artifacts. Compared to existing CS methods from single and multi-coli data, the proposed network shows minimal errors by removing the coherent aliasing artifacts. Furthermore, the computational time is by order of magnitude faster. Conclusion: As the proposed deep artifact learning network immediately generates accurate reconstruction, it has great potential for clinical applications."

    "title": "Evaluating Generative AI for CS1 Code Grading: Direct vs Reverse Methods",
    "summary": "Manual grading of programming assignments in introductory computer science courses can be time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. While unit testing is commonly used for automatic evaluation, it typically follows a binary pass/fail model and does not give partial marks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer the potential for automated, scalable, and more objective grading. This paper compares two AI-based grading techniques: Direct , where the AI model applies a rubric directly to student code, and Reverse (a newly proposed approach), where the AI first fixes errors, then deduces a grade based on the nature and number of fixes. Each method was evaluated on both the instructor's original grading scale and a tenfold expanded scale to assess the impact of range on AI grading accuracy. To assess their effectiveness, AI-assigned scores were evaluated against human tutor evaluations on a range of coding problems and error types. Initial findings suggest that while the Direct approach is faster and straightforward, the Reverse technique often provides a more fine-grained assessment by focusing on correction effort. Both methods require careful prompt engineering, particularly for allocating partial credit and handling logic errors. To further test consistency, we also used synthetic student code generated using Gemini Flash 2.0, which allowed us to evaluate AI graders on a wider range of controlled error types and difficulty levels. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach, practical considerations for prompt design, and future directions for hybrid human-AI grading systems that aim to improve consistency, efficiency, and fairness in CS courses."

    "title": "Improving Academic Plagiarism Detection for STEM Documents by Analyzing Mathematical Content and Citations",
    "summary": "Identifying academic plagiarism is a pressing task for educational and research institutions, publishers, and funding agencies. Current plagiarism detection systems reliably find instances of copied and moderately reworded text. However, reliably detecting concealed plagiarism, such as strong paraphrases, translations, and the reuse of nontextual content and ideas is an open research problem. In this paper, we extend our prior research on analyzing mathematical content and academic citations. Both are promising approaches for improving the detection of concealed academic plagiarism primarily in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). We make the following contributions: i) We present a two-stage detection process that combines similarity assessments of mathematical content, academic citations, and text. ii) We introduce new similarity measures that consider the order of mathematical features and outperform the measures in our prior research. iii) We compare the effectiveness of the math-based, citation-based, and text-based detection approaches using confirmed cases of academic plagiarism. iv) We demonstrate that the combined analysis of math-based and citation-based content features allows identifying potentially suspicious cases in a collection of 102K STEM documents. Overall, we show that analyzing the similarity of mathematical content and academic citations is a striking supplement for conventional text-based detection approaches for academic literature in the STEM disciplines."

    "summary": "It is well known that CS can boost massive random access protocols. Usually, the protocols operate in some overloaded regime where the sparsity can be exploited. In this paper, we consider a different approach by taking an orthogonal FFT base, subdivide its image into appropriate sub-channels and let each subchannel take only a fraction of the load. To show that this approach can actually achieve the full capacity we provide i) new concentration inequalities, and ii) devise a sparsity capture effect, i.e where the sub-division can be driven such that the activity in each each sub-channel is sparse by design. We show by simulations that the system is scalable resulting in a coarsely 30-fold capacity increase."

    "summary": "We present a detailed kinematical study and modeling of the emission of the molecular cores at ambient velocities surrounding IRAS 21391+5802, an intermediate-mass protostar embedded in IC 1396N. The high-density gas emission is found in association with three dense cores associated with the YSOs BIMA 1, BIMA 2, and BIMA 3. The CS (5-4) and CH3OH (5-4) emission around BIMA 1 has been modeled by considering a spatially infinitely thin ring seen edge-on by the observer. From the model we find that CS is detected over a wider radii range than CH3OH. A bipolar outflow is detected in the CS (2-1) line centered near BIMA 1. This outflow could be powered by a yet undetected YSO, BIMA 1W, or alternatively could be part of the BIMA 1 molecular outflow. The CS and CH3OH emission associated with the intermediate-mass protostar BIMA 2 is highly perturbed by the bipolar outflow even at cloud velocities, confirming that the protostar is in a very active stage of mass loss. For YSO BIMA 3 the lack of outflow and of clear evidence of infall suggests that both outflow and infall are weaker than in BIMA 1, and that BIMA 3 is probably a more evolved object."

We geometrically derive a novel non-orientable AdS spacetime that is an orientifold of a spinor double cover of AdS , unlike existing solutions. This spacetime's universal cover contains a lightlike instead of spacelike compact direction. We show that its gravity theory possesses a simpler excited state spectrum and exhibits a Chern-Simons/Wess-Zumino-Witt (CS/WZW) correspondence between only one independent CS term and boundary chiral WZW term. This leads us to suggest that CS theory is able to more fully describe non-orientable pure gravity theory compared to orientable gravity."

(2016) who detected non-Gaussian CS (1-0) emission lines toward the bubbles. Two of the bubbles are adjacent to infrared dark clouds (IRDCs); we examined these sources for evidence of interaction between the bubble rim and IRDC. The other two bubbles contain YSOs interior to the bubble rim; in these sources we observed the gas near the YSOs. We detect CS (1-0) emission toward all of the sources, and in several pointings the CS emission shows non-Gaussian line shapes. HC N (5-4), C S (1-0), CH OH (1-0), and SiO (v=0) (1-0) were also detected in some pointings. We calculate column densities and abundances for the detected molecules. We compare the velocity of optically-thick CS emission with the velocity of the other, optically thin lines to look for evidence of infall. We find that even in pointings with non-Gaussian CS emission, our detections do not support an infall model. We interpret the kinematics of the gas in N62, N65, and N117 as likely evidence of multiple clouds along the line of sight moving at slightly offset velocities. We do not detect evidence of bubble rims interacting with IRDCs in N62 or N90. The gas interior to bubbles appears more disrupted than the gas in the IRDCs. N65 shows significantly stronger emission lines than the other sources, as well as the most complicated non-Gaussian line shapes."

    "title": "Local Binary and Multiclass SVMs Trained on a Quantum Annealer",
    "summary": "Support vector machines (SVMs) are widely used machine learning models (e.g., in remote sensing), with formulations for both classification and regression tasks. In the last years, with the advent of working quantum annealers, hybrid SVM models characterised by quantum training and classical execution have been introduced. These models have demonstrated comparable performance to their classical counterparts. However, they are limited in the training set size due to the restricted connectivity of the current quantum annealers. Hence, to take advantage of large datasets (like those related to Earth observation), a strategy is required. In the classical domain, local SVMs, namely, SVMs trained on the data samples selected by a k-nearest neighbors model, have already proven successful. Here, the local application of quantum-trained SVM models is proposed and empirically assessed. In particular, this approach allows overcoming the constraints on the training set size of the quantum-trained models while enhancing their performance. In practice, the FaLK-SVM method, designed for efficient local SVMs, has been combined with quantum-trained SVM models for binary and multiclass classification. In addition, for comparison, FaLK-SVM has been interfaced for the first time with a classical single-step multiclass SVM model (CS SVM). Concerning the empirical evaluation, D-Wave's quantum annealers and real-world datasets taken from the remote sensing domain have been employed. The results have shown the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach, but also its practical applicability in a real-world large-scale scenario."

    "summary": "This paper introduces a Compressed Sensing (CS) estimation scheme for Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) channels with sparse multipath. The OTFS waveform represents signals in a two dimensional Delay-Doppler (DD) orthonormal basis. The proposed model does not require the assumption that the delays are integer multiples of the sampling period. The analysis shows that non-integer delay and Doppler shifts in the channel cannot be accurately modelled by integer approximations. An Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with Binary-division Refinement (OMPBR) estimation algorithm is proposed. The proposed estimator finds the best channel approximation over a continuous DD dictionary without integer approximations. This results in a significant reduction of the estimation normalized mean squared error with reasonable computational complexity."

    "summary": "Intercalation of alkali atoms within the lamellar transition metal dichalcogenides is a possible route toward a new generation of batteries. It is also a way to induce structural phase transitions authorizing the realization of optical and electrical switches in this class of materials. The process of intercalation has been mostly studied in three-dimensional dichalcogenide films. Here, we address the case of a single-layer of molybdenum disulfide (MoS ), deposited on a gold substrate, and intercalated with cesium (Cs) in ultra-clean conditions (ultrahigh vacuum). We show that intercalation decouples MoS from its substrate. We reveal electron transfer from Cs to MoS , relative changes in the energy of the valence band maxima, and electronic disorder induced by structural disorder in the intercalated Cs layer. Besides, we find an abnormal lattice expansion of MoS , which we relate to immediate vicinity of Cs. Intercalation is thermally activated, and so is the reverse process of de-intercalation. Our work opens the route to a microscopic understanding of a process of relevance in several possible future technologies, and shows a way to manipulate the properties of two-dimensional dichalcogenides by \"under-cover\" functionalization."

    "summary": "This study evaluates the application of predictive analytics for real-time cyber-attack detection and response, focusing on how statistical and machine learning methods can improve decision-making in Security Operations Centers (SOCs). Using a curated network-traffic dataset of 2,000 records, we analyzed key features such as attack type, packet length, anomaly scores, protocol usage, and geo-location patterns to assess their predictive value. Findings indicate that attack type has a measurable influence on response actions, while basic header metrics alone lack the precision needed for accurate classification. These results highlight the importance of incorporating richer contextual features - such as user behavior, asset criticality, and temporal patterns - into predictive models. By integrating such features into operational pipelines, organizations can improve early threat detection, reduce false positives, and optimize resource allocation. This research contributes actionable insights for advancing proactive, data-driven cyber defense strategies and outlines directions for future implementation in live SOC environments."

This paper considers the sparse recovery of a signal from a fusion frame. We use a block sparsity model for fusion frames and then show that sparse signals under this model can be compressively sampled and reconstructed in ways similar to standard Compressed Sensing (CS). In particular we invoke a mixed l1/l2 norm minimization in order to reconstruct sparse signals. In our work, we show that assuming a certain incoherence property of the subspaces and the apriori knowledge of it allows us to improve recovery when compared to the usual block sparsity case."

The fine analysis with LTE model atmospheres gives an iron metallicity for the four stars between 3.15 and 3.45 in good agreement with the abundances inferred from CaII K index by Beers et al. (1992). These four objects considerably augment the number of spectroscopically studied stars at the low metallicity extreme. We found the -elements Mg, Ca, Si, and Ti enhanced, and the iron-peak elements Sc, Mn and Cr tracking closely iron with the typical pattern of the more metallic halo stars. Aluminum results deficient with respect both to iron and to magnesium showing a strong odd-even\\/ effect, but for [Fe/H] 3.0 [Al/Mg] levels out into a plateau around 1.0, showing a primary behaviour. [Na/Fe] is 0.2 and only compared to magnesium it shows a mild odd-even effect. The heavy elements Sr and Ba show a large scatter which is not observed for other elements and cannot be due to observational errors only. In the case of CS 22891--209 they are particularly overabundant with [Sr,Ba/Fe] 0.9. The spread might reflect the presence of strong inhomogeneities in the interstellar gas at the earliest stages of Galaxy formation. This might be an important signature of the still elusive processes of the early formation of these elements observed in old stars."

    "title": "Compressed Sensing Microscopy with Scanning Line Probes",
    "summary": "In applications of scanning probe microscopy, images are acquired by raster scanning a point probe across a sample. Viewed from the perspective of compressed sensing (CS), this pointwise sampling scheme is inefficient, especially when the target image is structured. While replacing point measurements with delocalized, incoherent measurements has the potential to yield order-of-magnitude improvements in scan time, implementing the delocalized measurements of CS theory is challenging. In this paper we study a partially delocalized probe construction, in which the point probe is replaced with a continuous line, creating a sensor which essentially acquires line integrals of the target image. We show through simulations, rudimentary theoretical analysis, and experiments, that these line measurements can image sparse samples far more efficiently than traditional point measurements, provided the local features in the sample are enough separated. Despite this promise, practical reconstruction from line measurements poses additional difficulties: the measurements are partially coherent, and real measurements exhibit nonidealities. We show how to overcome these limitations using natural strategies (reweighting to cope with coherence, blind calibration for nonidealities), culminating in an end-to-end demonstration."

One popular technique to reconstruct or approximate the unknown sparse signal is the iterative hard thresholding (IHT) which however performs very poorly under non-Gaussian noise conditions or in the face of outliers (gross errors). In this paper, we propose a robust IHT method based on ideas from -estimation that estimates the sparse signal and the scale of the error distribution simultaneously. The method has a negligible performance loss compared to IHT under Gaussian noise, but superior performance under heavy-tailed non-Gaussian noise conditions."

    "summary": "Computer science attracts few women, and their proportion decreases through advancing career stages. Few women progress to PhD studies in CS after completing master's studies. Empowering women at this stage in their careers is essential to unlock untapped potential for society, industry and academia. This paper identifies students' career assumptions and information related to PhD studies focused on gender-based differences. We propose a Women Career Lunch program to inform female master students about PhD studies that explains the process, clarifies misconceptions, and alleviates concerns. An extensive survey was conducted to identify factors that encourage and discourage students from undertaking PhD studies. We identified statistically significant differences between those who undertook PhD studies and those who didn't, as well as gender differences. A catalogue of questions to initiate discussions with potential PhD students which allowed them to explore these factors was developed and translated to 8 languages. Encouraging factors toward PhD study include interest and confidence in research arising from a research involvement during earlier studies; enthusiasm for and self-confidence in CS in addition to an interest in an academic career; encouragement from external sources; and a positive perception towards PhD studies which can involve achieving personal goals. Discouraging factors include uncertainty and lack of knowledge of the PhD process, a perception of lower job flexibility, and the requirement for long-term commitment. Gender differences highlighted that female students who pursue a PhD have less confidence in their technical skills than males but a higher preference for interdisciplinary areas. Female students are less inclined than males to perceive the industry as offering better job opportunities and more flexible career paths than academia."

    "summary": "Among the approaches in three-dimensional (3D) single molecule localization microscopy, there are several point spread function (PSF) engineering approaches, in which depth information of molecules is encoded in 2D images. Usually,the molecules are excited sparsely in each raw image. The consequence is that the temporal resolution has to be sacrificed. In order to improve temporal resolution and ensure localization accuracy, we propose a method, SH-CS, based on light needle excitation, detection system with single helix-point spread function (SH-PSF), and compressed sensing (CS). Although the SH-CS method still has a limitation about the molecule density, it is suited for relatively dense molecules. For each light needle scanning position, an SH image of excited molecules is processed with CS algorithm to decode their axial information. Simulations demonstrated, for random distributed 1 ~ 15 molecules in depth range of 4 μm, the axial localization accuracy is 12.1 nm ~ 73.5 nm. The feasibility of this method is validated by experimental data."

We have given the general rules to find the reduced tensor algebra whose elements give the physical inequivalent quantum numbers that characterize uniquely the CS observables. Some general properties of the reduced tensor algebra and of the surgery operator are studied. Many examples of the general construction are given in the case of G=SU(2) and G=SU(3), in particular the expectation value of a Wilson line associated with the unknot and the Hopf link in R^3(S^3) is computed for any irreducible representation of the gauge group. The relation of the topological invariant I(M), defined as a suitable modified partition function of the CS theory in M, and the fundamental group of M is studied. Finally, the relationship between CS theory and WZWN model in two dimensions is exploited to derive from a full three-dimensional point of view some classical results in conformal field theory."

Reconnection is assumed to happen in a small patch across a Syrovatskií (non-uniform) current sheet (CS) with skewed magnetic fields. The background magnetic pressure has its maximum at the center of the CS plane, and decreases toward the edges of the plane. The reconnection patch creates two V-shaped reconnected tubes that shorten as they retract in opposite directions, due to magnetic tension. One of them moves upward toward the top edge of the CS, and the other one moves downward toward the top of the underlying arcade. Rotational discontinuities (RDs) propagate along the legs of the tubes and generate parallel super-sonic flows that collide at the center of the tube. There, gas dynamics shocks that compress and heat the plasma are launched outwardly. The descending tube moves through the bottom part of the CS where it expands laterally in response to the background magnetic pressure. This effect may decrease plasma density by 30 % to 50 % of background levels. This tube will arrive at the top of the arcade that will slow it down to a stop. Here, the perpendicular dynamics is halted, but the parallel dynamics continues along its legs; the RDs are shut down, and the gas is rarified to even lower densities. The hot postshock regions continue evolving, determining a long lasting hot region on top of the arcade. We provide an observational method based on total emission measure and mean temperature, that indicates where in the CS the tube has been reconnected."

First we consider the behavior of the majority model in with an initial random configuration, where each node is blue independently with probability and red otherwise. It is shown that in this setting the process goes through a phase transition at the connectivity threshold, namely . Furthermore, we discuss the majority model is a `good' and `fast' density classifier on regular expanders. More precisely, we prove if the second-largest absolute eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of an -node -regular graph is sufficiently smaller than then the majority model by starting from blue nodes (for an arbitrarily small constant ) results in fully red configuration in sub-logarithmically many rounds. As a by-product of our results, we show Ramanujan graphs are asymptotically optimally immune, that is for an -node -regular Ramanujan graph if the initial number of blue nodes is , the number of blue nodes in the next round is at most for some constants .

Unlike a standard bare tether equipped with an active electron emitter, LWTs close the electrical circuit (cathodic contact) with the ambient plasma in a passive manner thanks to the thermionic and photoelectric effects. This work presents experimental results on a novel procedure for manufacturing LWT samples. Conductive substrates (aluminum and copper) have been coated with graphene oxide doped with Cesium by using a scalable, simple and cost-effective coating method with an airbrush. Both GO and Cs-doped GO (GO/Cs) samples were characterized utilizing X-ray spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, four-point probe, and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). They showed that GO sheets were successfully doped with Cs atoms, which do not agglomerate on the graphene sheets and do not form particles. The UPS results indicated that by doping GO sheets with Cs, the work function of GO decreases from 4.6 eV to 3.09 eV, thus increasing the applicability of GO as an electron emitter material."

    "summary": "We report on a novel experimental approach for studying the dissipative spreading of collective motion in a meta-stable nuclear system, using, for the first time, highly fissile nuclei with spherical shape. This was achieved by fragmentation of 45 radioactive heavy-ion beams at GSI, Darmstadt. The use of inverse kinematics and a dedicated experimental set-up allowed for the identification in atomic number of both fission fragments. From the width of their charge distributions, a transient time of (3.3 +/- 0.7) 10-21 s is deduced for initially spherical nuclei."

    "summary": "Despite the tremendous interest in halide perovskites in solar cells, the reason that the all-inorganic perovskite CsPbI is unstable at room temperature remains mysterious. Here single-crystal X-ray diffraction and powder pair distribution function (PDF) measurements characterize bulk perovskite CsPbI from 100 to 295 K to elucidate its thermodynamic instability. While Cs occupies a single site from 100 to 150 K, it splits between two sites from 175 to 295 K with the second site having a lower effective coordination number, which along with other structural parameters suggests that Cs rattles in its coordination polyhedron. PDF measurements reveal that on the length scale of the unit cell, the Pb-I octahedra concurrently become greatly distorted, with one of the I-Pb-I angles approaching 82° compared to the ideal 90°. The rattling of Cs, low number of Cs-I contacts, and high degree of octahedral distortion cause the instability of perovskite-phase CsPbI . These results provide detailed structural information that may help to engineer greater stability of CsPbI and other all-inorganic perovskites for use in solar cells."

    "summary": "In this paper, we study Rényi holographic dark energy model in the context of Chern Simons (CS) modified gravity theory. Different cosmological parameters such as energy density, deceleration parameter, equation of state, square of sound speed and cosmological plane are discussed using FRW metric. Two separate solutions of CS field equations arose. The Rényi HDE model showed the transition from deceleration to acceleration phase which is fully consistent with the observational data while in the second case it represented a decelerated phase of expansion only. In fact, EoS illustrates the era of dominance of the universe by certain components. Our results predicted that the universe is under the influence of dark energy as EoS showed accelerated expansion phase. On the other hand case two advocated the influence of CDM. In both cases, indicated that the Rényi HDE model is in the freezing region and cosmic expansion is more accelerating in the context of CS modified gravity. It is also observed that the value of is positive a sufficient condition for the stability of the system. Hence it is concluded that the Rényi HDE model is supported by the results of general relativity in the framework of CS modified gravity."

    "summary": "Recent years have seen a strong interest in topological effects within periodically driven systems. In this work, we explore topological effects in two closely related 2-dimensional driven systems described by Floquet operators possessing chiral symmetry (CS). Our numerical and analytical results suggest the following. Firstly, the CS is associated with the existence of the anomalous counter-propagating (ACP) modes reported recently. Specifically, we show that a particular form of CS protects the ACP modes occurring at quasienergies of . We also find that these modes are only present along selected boundaries, suggesting that they are a weak topological effect. Secondly, we find that CS can give rise to protected and quasienergy modes, and that the number of these modes may increase without bound as we tune up certain system parameters. Like the ACP modes, these and modes also appear only along selected boundaries and thus appear to be a weak topological effect. To our knowledge, this work represents the first detailed study of weak topological effects in periodically driven systems. Our findings add to the still-growing knowledge on driven topological systems."

    "summary": "One of the most striking features found in the cosmic microwave background data is the presence of an anomalous Cold Spot (CS) in the temperature maps made by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). This CS has been interpreted as the result of the presence of a collapsing texture, perhaps coming from some early universe Grand Unified Theory (GUT) phase transition. In this work we propose an alternative explanation based on a completely different kind of texture which appears in a natural way in a broad class of brane-world models. This type of textures known as brane-skyrmions can be understood as holes in the brane which make possible to pass through them along the extra-dimensional space. The typical scales needed for the proposed brane-skyrmions to correctly describe the observed CS can be as low as the electroweak scale."

We report on series of unconventional NEA activations on surfaces of bulk GaAs with Cs, Sb, and O2 using different methods of oxygen exposure for optimizing photocathode performance. One order of magnitude improvement in lifetime with respect to the standard Cs-O2 activation is achieved without significant loss on electron spin polarization and quantum efficiency by codepositing Cs, Sb, and O2. A strained GaAs/GaAsP superlattice sample activated with the codeposition method demonstrated similar enhancement in lifetime near the photoemission threshold while maintaining 90% spin polarization."

    "title": "The origin of the high velocity circumstellar gas around SN 1998S",
    "summary": "Modelling of high resolution Balmer line profiles in the early-time spectra of SN 1998S shows that the inferred fast (roughly 400 km/s) circumstellar (CS) gas on days 23 and 42 post-explosion is confined to a narrow, negative velocity gradient shell just above the photosphere. This gas may be identified with a slow (v < 40 km/s) progenitor wind accelerated at the ejecta-wind interface. In this scenario, the photosphere coincides with a cool dense shell formed in the reverse shock. Acceleration by radiation from the supernova or by a shock-accelerated relativistic particle precursor are both possible explanations for the observed fast CS gas. An alternative, equally plausible scenario is that the fast CS gas is accelerated within shocked clouds engulfed by the outer shock, as it propagates through the intercloud wind."

    "title": "Learning to sample in Cartesian MRI",
    "summary": "Despite its exceptional soft tissue contrast, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) faces the challenge of long scanning times compared to other modalities like X-ray radiography. Shortening scanning times is crucial in clinical settings, as it increases patient comfort, decreases examination costs and improves throughput. Recent advances in compressed sensing (CS) and deep learning allow accelerated MRI acquisition by reconstructing high-quality images from undersampled data. While reconstruction algorithms have received most of the focus, designing acquisition trajectories to optimize reconstruction quality remains an open question. This thesis explores two approaches to address this gap in the context of Cartesian MRI. First, we propose two algorithms, lazy LBCS and stochastic LBCS, that significantly improve upon Gözcü et al.'s greedy learning-based CS (LBCS) approach. These algorithms scale to large, clinically relevant scenarios like multi-coil 3D MR and dynamic MRI, previously inaccessible to LBCS. Additionally, we demonstrate that generative adversarial networks (GANs) can serve as a natural criterion for adaptive sampling by leveraging variance in the measurement domain to guide acquisition. Second, we delve into the underlying structures or assumptions that enable mask design algorithms to perform well in practice. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, while capable of adaptation and long-horizon planning, offer only marginal improvements over stochastic LBCS, which is neither adaptive nor does long-term planning. Altogether, our findings suggest that stochastic LBCS and similar methods represent promising alternatives to deep RL. They shine in particular by their scalability and computational efficiency and could be key in the deployment of optimized acquisition trajectories in Cartesian MRI."

    "summary": "High pressure effects on the superconducting transitions of beta-pyrochlore superconductors AOs2O6 (A = Cs, Rb, K) are studied by measuring resistivity under high pressures up to 10 GPa. The superconducting transition temperature Tc first increases with increasing pressure in all the compounds and then exhibits a broad maximum at 7.6 K (6 GPa), 8.2 K (2 GPa) and 10 K (0.6 GPa) for A = Cs, Rb and K, respectviely. Finally, the superconductivity is suppressed completely at a critical pressure near 7 GPa and 6 GPa for A = Rb and K and probably above 10 GPa for A = Cs. Characteristic changes in the coefficinet A of the T2 term in resistivity and residual resistivity are observed, both of which are synchronized with the corresponding change in Tc. It is suggested that electron correlations and certain quantum fluctuations play important roles in the occurrence or suppression of superconductivity in the beta-pyrochlore oxides."

    "title": "Large Language Models and Foundation Models in Smart Agriculture: Basics, Opportunities, and Challenges",
    "summary": "The past decade has witnessed the rapid development and adoption of ML & DL methodologies in agricultural systems, showcased by great successes in agricultural applications. However, these conventional ML/DL models have certain limitations: they heavily rely on large, costly-to-acquire labeled datasets for training, require specialized expertise for development and maintenance, and are mostly tailored for specific tasks, thus lacking generalizability. Recently, large pre-trained models, also known as FMs, have demonstrated remarkable successes in language, vision, and decision-making tasks across various domains. These models are trained on a large amount of data from multiple domains and modalities. Once trained, they can accomplish versatile tasks with just minor fine-tuning and minimal task-specific labeled data. Despite their proven effectiveness and huge potential, there has been little exploration of applying FMs to agriculture AI. Thus, this study aims to explore the potential of FMs in the field of smart agriculture. In particular, conceptual tools and technical background are presented to help the understanding of the problem space and uncover new research directions. To this end, recent FMs in the general CS domain are reviewed, and the models are categorized into four categories: language FMs, vision FMs, multimodal FMs, and reinforcement learning FMs. Then, the steps of developing agriculture FMs (AFMs) are outlined and potential applications in smart agriculture are discussed. Moreover, challenges and risks associated with developing AFMs are discussed, including model training, validation, and deployment. In summary, the advancement of AI in agriculture is explored by introducing AFMs as a promising paradigm that can significantly mitigate the reliance on extensive labeled datasets and enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and generalization of agricultural AI systems."

    "title": "Antiferromagnetic magnons from fractionalized excitations",
    "summary": "We develop an approach to describe antiferromagnetic magnons on a bipartite lattice supporting the Néel state using fractionalized degrees of freedom typically inherent to quantum spin liquids. In particular we consider a long-range magnetically ordered state of interacting two-dimensional quantum spin models using the Chern-Simons (CS) fermion representation of interacting spins. The interaction leads to Cooper instability and pairing of CS fermions, and to CS superconductivity which spontaneously violates the continuous symmetry generating a linearly-dispersing gapless Nambu-Goldstone mode due to phase fluctuations. We evaluate this mode and show that it is in high-precision agreement with magnons of the corresponding Néel antiferromagnet irrespective to the lattice symmetry. Using the fermion formulation of a system with competing interactions, we show that the frustration gives raise to nontrivial long-range four, six, and higher-leg interaction vertices mediated by the CS gauge field, which are responsible for restoring of the continuous symmetry at sufficiently strong frustration. We identify these new interaction vertices and discuss their implications to unconventional phase transitions. We also apply the proposed theory to a model of anyons that can be tuned continuously from fermions to bosons."

    "title": "Unknown sparsity in compressed sensing: Denoising and inference",
    "summary": "The theory of Compressed Sensing (CS) asserts that an unknown signal can be accurately recovered from an underdetermined set of linear measurements with , provided that is sufficiently sparse. However, in applications, the degree of sparsity is typically unknown, and the problem of directly estimating has been a longstanding gap between theory and practice. A closely related issue is that is a highly idealized measure of sparsity, and for real signals with entries not equal to 0, the value is not a useful description of compressibility. In our previous conference paper [Lop13] that examined these problems, we considered an alternative measure of \"soft\" sparsity, , and designed a procedure to estimate that does not rely on sparsity assumptions. The present work offers a new deconvolution-based method for estimating unknown sparsity, which has wider applicability and sharper theoretical guarantees. In particular, we introduce a family of entropy-based sparsity measures parameterized by . This family interpolates between and as ranges over . For any , we propose an estimator whose relative error converges at the dimension-free rate of , even when . Our main results also describe the limiting distribution of , as well as some connections to Basis Pursuit Denosing, the Lasso, deterministic measurement matrices, and inference problems in CS."

    "title": "Effective quantum state reconstruction using compressive sensing in NMR quantum computing",
    "summary": "The number of measurements required to reconstruct the states of quantum systems increases exponentially with the quantum system dimensions, which makes the state reconstruction of high-qubit quantum systems have a great challenge in physical quantum computing experiments. Compressive sensing (CS) has been verified as a effective technique in the reconstruction of quantum state, however, it is still unknown that if CS can reconstruct quantum states given the less data measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In this paper, we propose an effective NMR quantum state reconstruction method based on CS. Different from the conventional CS-based quantum state reconstruction, our method uses the actual observation data from NMR experiments rather than the data measured by the Pauli operators. We implement measurements on quantum states in practical NMR computing experiments and reconstruct states of 2,3,4 qubits using fewer number of measurements, respectively. The proposed method is easy to implement and performs more efficiently with the increase of the system dimension size. The performance reveals both efficiency and accuracy, which provides an alternative for the quantum state reconstruction in practical NMR."

We propose a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a minimum consistent subset of a k-chromatic spider graph when k is a constant. We also show MCS remains NP-complete on trees."

    "summary": "In dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, low-rank plus sparse (L+S) decomposition, or robust principal component analysis (PCA), has achieved stunning performance. However, the selection of the parameters of L+S is empirical, and the acceleration rate is limited, which are common failings of iterative compressed sensing MR imaging (CS-MRI) reconstruction methods. Many deep learning approaches have been proposed to address these issues, but few of them use a low-rank prior. In this paper, a model-based low-rank plus sparse network, dubbed L+S-Net, is proposed for dynamic MR reconstruction. In particular, we use an alternating linearized minimization method to solve the optimization problem with low-rank and sparse regularization. Learned soft singular value thresholding is introduced to ensure the clear separation of the L component and S component. Then, the iterative steps are unrolled into a network in which the regularization parameters are learnable. We prove that the proposed L+S-Net achieves global convergence under two standard assumptions. Experiments on retrospective and prospective cardiac cine datasets show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art CS and existing deep learning methods and has great potential for extremely high acceleration factors (up to 24x)."

    "title": "Analytical computation of quasi-normal modes of slowly-rotating black-holes in dCS gravity",
    "summary": "Using gravitational wave observations to search for deviations from general relativity in the strong-gravity regime has become an important research direction. Chern Simons (CS) gravity is one of the most frequently studied parity-violating models of strong gravity. It is known that the Kerr black-hole is not a solution for CS gravity. At the same time, the only rotating solution available in the literature for dynamical CS (dCS) gravity is the slow-rotating case most accurately known to quadratic order in spin. In this work, for the slow-rotating case (accurate to first order in spin), we derive the linear perturbation equations governing the metric and the dCS field accurate to linear order in spin and quadratic order in the CS coupling parameter ( ) and obtain the quasi-normal mode (QNM) frequencies. After confirming the recent results of Wagle et al. (2021), we find an additional contribution to the eigenfrequency correction at the leading perturbative order of . Unlike Wagle et al., we also find corrections to frequencies in the polar sector. We compute these extra corrections by evaluating the expectation values of the perturbative potential on unperturbed QNM wavefunctions along a contour deformed into the complex- plane. For , we obtain the ratio of the imaginary parts of the dCS correction to the GR correction in the first QNM frequency (in the polar sector) to be implying significant change. For the mode, the dCS corrections make the imaginary part of the first QNM of the fundamental mode less negative, thereby decreasing the decay rate. Our results, along with future gravitational wave observations, can be used to test for dCS gravity and further constrain the CS coupling parameters. [abridged]"

    "summary": "Optical tomograms can be envisaged as patterns. The Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) algorithm provides a platform to train the machine to compare patterns corresponding to input and generated tomograms. Using a deep-learning framework with two convolutional neural networks and WGAN, we have trained the machine to generate tomograms of Fock states, coherent states (CS) and the single photon added CS ( -PACS). The training process was continued until the Wasserstein distance between the input and output tomographic patterns levelled off at a low value. The mean photon number, variances and higher moments were extracted directly from the generated tomograms, to distinguish between different Fock states and also between the CS and the -PACS, without using an additional classifier neural network. The robustness of our results has been verified using two error models and also with different colormaps that define the tomographic patterns. We have examined if the training program successfully reflected some of the findings in a recent experiment in which state reconstruction was carried out to establish that the fidelities between an amplified CS, an optimal CS and a -PACS were close to unity, over a range of parameter values. By training the machine to reproduce tomograms corresponding to these specific states, and comparing the mean photon numbers of these states obtained directly from the tomograms, we have established that the variations in these observables reflect the experimental trends. State reconstruction from tomograms could be challenging, in general, since the Hilbert space associated with quantized light is large. The tomographic approach provides a viable alternative to detailed state reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the use of machine learning to generate optical tomograms from which the states can be directly characterized."

A compact component around the protostar is clearly detected in the CS and SO emission. The velocity structure of the compact component of CS reveals infalling-rotating motion conserving the angular momentum. It is well explained by a ballistic model of an infalling-rotating envelope with the radius of the centrifugal barrier (a half of the centrifugal radius) of 50 AU, although the distribution of the infalling gas is asymmetric around the protostar. The distribution of SO is mostly concentrated around the radius of the centrifugal barrier of the simple model. Thus a drastic change in chemical composition of the gas infalling onto the protostar is found to occur at a 50 AU scale probably due to accretion shocks, demonstrating that the infalling material is significantly processed before being delivered into the disk."

    "summary": "The solar chromosphere is a crucial interface between the solar interior and its interplanetary environment, regulating how energy is locally deposited into heat and transported into the upper atmospheric layers. Despite significant progress, the dominant processes responsible for chromospheric heating remain debated, particularly under quiet-Sun (QS) conditions. We aim to disentangle and quantify the respective roles of shocks and current sheets (CS) in QS chromospheric modeling. We use a simulation performed with the radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code Bifrost. In order to identify shocks and CS events across space and time, we develop and apply physics-based criteria, allowing us to describe their dynamics and evaluate their contributions to both dissipative (viscous and ohmic) and mechanical (including compressive work) heating. Shocks are found to dominate the energy deposition in the lower chromosphere (up to of the mechanical heating), while CS become the primary contributor in the upper chromosphere, as both plasma and Mach number drop. Overall, of the mechanical chromospheric heating is powered by the combined action of shocks and CS. These results support a multi-process view of the chromospheric heating in the QS, dominated by shocks, CS, and non-steep gradient dynamics. In addition to viscous and ohmic dissipation, compressive heating can play a major role locally in the model, particularly in chromospheric shock structures, where it offsets non-reversibly cooling from expansion and radiation, and therefore constitutes a key heating contribution to consider in the energy budget. This study further highlights the need for next-generation observations to resolve the intermittent and small-scale nature of chromospheric dynamics, in order to bring new constraints on the coupling between the different layers of the solar atmosphere."

    "summary": "Multidimensional NMR spectroscopy is one of the basic tools for determining the structure of biomolecules. Unfortunately, the resolution of the spectra is often limited by inter-nuclear couplings. This limitation cannot be overcome by common ways of increasing resolution, i.e. non-uniform sampling (NUS) followed by compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction. In this paper, we show how to enrich CS processing with virtual decoupling leading to an increase in resolution, sensitivity, and overall quality of NUS reconstruction. A mathematical description of the decoupling by deconvolution approach explains the effects of noise, modulation of the sampling schedule, and reveals relation with the underlying assumption of the CS. The gain in resolution and sensitivity is demonstrated for the basic experiment used for protein backbone assignment 3D HNCA applied to two large protein systems: intrinsically disordered 441-residue Tau and a 509-residue globular bacteriophytochrome fragment."

    "summary": "Synthetic transmit aperture (STA) ultrasound imaging is well known for ideal focusing in the full field of view. However, it suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low frame rate, because each array element must be activated individually. In our previous study, we encoded all the array elements with partial Hadamard matrix and reconstructed the complete STA dataset with compressed sensing (CS) algorithm (CS-STA). As all the elements are activated in each transmission and the number of transmissions is smaller than that of STA, this method can achieve higher SNR and higher frame rate. Its main drawback is the time-consuming CS reconstruction. In this study, we accelerate the complete STA dataset reconstruction with minimal l2-norm least square method. Thanks of the orthogonality of partial Hadamard matrix, the minimal l2-norm least square solution can be easily calculated. The proposed method is tested with simulation data and experimental phantom and in-vivo data. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves ~5*10^3 times faster reconstruction speed than CS algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of achieving the same accuracy for STA dataset reconstruction as conventional CS-STA method. The simulations, phantom and in-vivo experiments show that the proposed method is capable of improving the generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) and SNR with maintained spatial resolution and fewer transmissions, compared with STA. In conclusion, the improved image quality and reduced computational time of LS-STA pave the way for its real-time applications in the clinics."

A total of 35 healthy volunteers underwent conventional two-fold accelerated MRCP scans at field strengths of 3T and 0.55T. We trained DL reconstructions using two different training strategies, supervised (SV) and self-supervised (SSV), with retrospectively six-fold undersampled data obtained at 3T. We then evaluated the DL reconstructions against standard techniques, parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS), focusing on peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) as metrics. We also tested DL reconstructions with prospectively accelerated acquisitions and evaluated their robustness when changing fields strengths from 3T to 0.55T. DL reconstructions demonstrated a reduction in average acquisition time from 599/542 to 255/180 seconds for MRCP at 3T/0.55T. In both retrospective and prospective undersampling, PSNR and SSIM of DL reconstructions were higher than those of PI and CS. At the same time, DL reconstructions preserved the image quality of undersampled data, including sharpness and the visibility of hepatobiliary ducts. In addition, both DL approaches produced high-quality reconstructions at 0.55T. In summary, DL reconstructions trained for highly accelerated MRCP enabled a reduction in acquisition time by a factor of 2.4/3.0 at 3T/0.55T while maintaining the image quality of conventional acquisitions."

This suggests that some fraction of young binary systems which possess massive circumbinary disks (CB) may be in the midst of planet formation. However, there are very few CB disks detected. We revisit one of the known CB disks, the UY Aurigae system, and probe 13CO 2-1, C18O 2-1, SO 5(6)-4(5) and 12CO 3-2 line emission and the thermal dust continuum. Our new results confirm the existence of the CB disk. In addition, the circumstellar (CS) disks are clearly resolved in dust continuum at 1.4 mm. The spectral indices between the wavelengths of 0.85 mm and 6 cm are found to be surprisingly low, being 1.6 for both CS disks. The deprojected separation of the binary is 1.26\" based on our 1.4 mm continuum data. This is 0.07\" (10 AU) larger than in earlier studies. Combining the fact of the variation of UY Aur B in band, we propose that the CS disk of an undetected companion UY Aur Bb obscures UY Aur Ba. A very complex kinematical pattern inside the CB disk is observed due to a mixing of Keplerian rotation of the CB disk, the infall and outflow gas. The streaming gas accreting from the CB ring toward the CS disks and possible outflows are also identified and resolved. The SO emission is found to be at the bases of the streaming shocks. Our results suggest that the UY Aur system is undergoing an active accretion phase from the CB disk to the CS disks. The UY Aur B might also be a binary system, making the UY Aur a triple system."

We apply this framework to the hypergraph matching, knapsack, and -column sparse packing problems. In the hypergraph matching setting, we adapt the technique of Guruganesh, Lee (2018) to non-constructively prove that the correlation gap is at least and provide a monotone -balanced contention resolution scheme, generalizing the results of Bruggmann, Zenklusen (2019). For the knapsack problem, we prove that the correlation gap of instances where exactly copies of each item fit into the knapsack is at least and provide several monotone contention resolution schemes: a -balanced scheme for instances where all item sizes are strictly bigger than , a -balanced scheme for instances where all item sizes are at most , and a -balanced scheme for instances with arbitrary item sizes. For -column sparse packing integer programs, we slightly modify the -approximation algorithm for -CS-PIP based on the strengthened LP relaxation presented in Brubach et al.

    "title": "CS Sparse K-means: An Algorithm for Cluster-Specific Feature Selection in High-Dimensional Clustering",
    "summary": "Feature selection is an important and challenging task in high dimensional clustering. For example, in genomics, there may only be a small number of genes that are differentially expressed, which are informative to the overall clustering structure. Existing feature selection methods, such as Sparse K-means, rarely tackle the problem of accounting features that can only separate a subset of clusters. In genomics, it is highly likely that a gene can only define one subtype against all the other subtypes or distinguish a pair of subtypes but not others. In this paper, we propose a K-means based clustering algorithm that discovers informative features as well as which cluster pairs are separable by each selected features. The method is essentially an EM algorithm, in which we introduce lasso-type constraints on each cluster pair in the M step, and make the E step possible by maximizing the raw cross-cluster distance instead of minimizing the intra-cluster distance. The results were demonstrated on simulated data and a leukemia gene expression dataset."

    "summary": "We apply the method of compressed sensing (CS) quantum process tomography (QPT) to characterize quantum gates based on superconducting Xmon and phase qubits. Using experimental data for a two-qubit controlled-Z gate, we obtain an estimate for the process matrix with reasonably high fidelity compared to full QPT, but using a significantly reduced set of initial states and measurement configurations. We show that the CS method still works when the amount of used data is so small that the standard QPT would have an underdetermined system of equations. We also apply the CS method to the analysis of the three-qubit Toffoli gate with numerically added noise, and similarly show that the method works well for a substantially reduced set of data. For the CS calculations we use two different bases in which the process matrix is approximately sparse, and show that the resulting estimates of the process matrices match each ther with reasonably high fidelity. For both two-qubit and three-qubit gates, we characterize the quantum process by not only its process matrix and fidelity, but also by the corresponding standard deviation, defined via variation of the state fidelity for different initial states."

    "title": "Convergent Complex Quasi-Newton Proximal Methods for Gradient-Driven Denoisers in Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction",
    "summary": "In compressed sensing (CS) MRI, model-based methods are pivotal to achieving accurate reconstruction. One of the main challenges in model-based methods is finding an effective prior to describe the statistical distribution of the target image. Plug-and-Play (PnP) and REgularization by Denoising (RED) are two general frameworks that use denoisers as the prior. While PnP/RED methods with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based denoisers outperform classical hand-crafted priors in CS MRI, their convergence theory relies on assumptions that do not hold for practical CNNs. The recently developed gradient-driven denoisers offer a framework that bridges the gap between practical performance and theoretical guarantees. However, the numerical solvers for the associated minimization problem remain slow for CS MRI reconstruction. This paper proposes a complex quasi-Newton proximal method that achieves faster convergence than existing approaches. To address the complex domain in CS MRI, we propose a modified Hessian estimation method that guarantees Hermitian positive definiteness. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous convergence analysis of the proposed method for nonconvex settings. Numerical experiments on both Cartesian and non-Cartesian sampling trajectories demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach."

    "title": "Strong-Weak Distribution Alignment for Adaptive Object Detection",
    "summary": "We propose an approach for unsupervised adaptation of object detectors from label-rich to label-poor domains which can significantly reduce annotation costs associated with detection. Recently, approaches that align distributions of source and target images using an adversarial loss have been proven effective for adapting object classifiers. However, for object detection, fully matching the entire distributions of source and target images to each other at the global image level may fail, as domains could have distinct scene layouts and different combinations of objects. On the other hand, strong matching of local features such as texture and color makes sense, as it does not change category level semantics. This motivates us to propose a novel method for detector adaptation based on strong local alignment and weak global alignment. Our key contribution is the weak alignment model, which focuses the adversarial alignment loss on images that are globally similar and puts less emphasis on aligning images that are globally dissimilar. Additionally, we design the strong domain alignment model to only look at local receptive fields of the feature map. We empirically verify the effectiveness of our method on four datasets comprising both large and small domain shifts. Our code is available at https://github.com/VisionLearningGroup/DA_Detection"

It leverages on the measurements-by-design (MebD) paradigm and it exploits some a-priori information on the antenna under test (AUT) to generate an over-complete representation basis. Accordingly, the problem at hand is reformulated in a compressive sensing (CS) framework as the retrieval of a maximally-sparse distribution (with respect to the overcomplete basis) from a reduced set of measured data and then it is solved by means of a Bayesian strategy. Representative numerical results are presented to, also comparatively, assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing the \"burden/cost\" of the acquisition process as well as to mitigate (possible) truncation errors when dealing with space-constrained probing systems."

Compared with the inverse regression estimation methods (e.g. Li, 1991, 1992; Cook and Weisberg, 1991), the new methods require no strong assumptions on the design of covariates or the functional relation between regressors and the response variable, and have better performance than the inverse regression estimation methods for finite samples. Compared with the direct regression estimation methods (e.g. Härdle and Stoker, 1989; Hristache, Juditski, Polzehl and Spokoiny, 2001; Xia, Tong, Li and Zhu, 2002), which can only estimate the directions of CS in the regression mean, the new methods can detect the directions of CS exhaustively. Consistency of the estimators and the convergence of corresponding algorithms are proved."

The first method uses a new approach to create a network based on retweet relationships between users and the most retweeted users, the so-called influencers. The second method extracts hashtags from users posts to create a \"user feature vector\" which is then clustered, using a consensus matrix based on previous work, to identify groups using the same language. With both approaches it was possible to identify clusters that seem to fit groups of different public opinions in Germany. However, we also found that clusters from one approach can not be associated with clusters from the other due to filtering steps in the two methods."

The synthesizer has two microwave outputs of 7 GHz and 9 GHz for Rb and Cs atom interrogation, respectively. The short-term stability of these microwave signals, measured using an optical frequency comb locked to an ultra-stable laser, is better than at an averaging time of 1 s. We demonstrate that the short-term stability of the synthesizer is lower than the quantum projection noise limit of the Cs fountain clock, KRISS-F1(Cs) by measuring the short-term stability of the fountain with varying trapped atom number. The stability of the fountain at 1-s averaging time reaches at the highest atom number in the experiment when the synthesizer is used as an interrogation oscillator of the fountain. In order to compensate the frequency drift of the CSO, the output frequency of a waveform generator in the synthesis chain is ramped linearly. By doing this, the stability of the synthesizer at an average time of one hour reaches a level of which is measured with the fountain clock."

Domination of the 6p scalar polarizabilities by 5d-6p dipole matrix elements facilitates an exacting consistency check of 5d lifetime and 6p polarizability data.

We present a deep learning-based framework for automated artery labeling from 3D Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography (3D ToF-MRA) segmentations (n=35), incorporating uncertainty quantification to enhance interpretability and reliability. We evaluated three convolutional neural network architectures: (1) a UNet with residual encoder blocks, reflecting commonly used baselines in vascular labeling; (2) CS-Net, an attention-augmented UNet incorporating channel and spatial attention mechanisms for enhanced curvilinear structure recognition; and (3) nnUNet, a self-configuring framework that automates preprocessing, training, and architectural adaptation based on dataset characteristics. Among these, nnUNet achieved the highest labeling performance (average Dice score: 0.922; average surface distance: 0.387 mm), with improved robustness in anatomically complex vessels. To assess predictive confidence, we implemented test-time augmentation (TTA) and introduced a novel coordinate-guided strategy to reduce interpolation errors during augmented inference. The resulting uncertainty maps reliably indicated regions of anatomical ambiguity, pathological variation, or manual labeling inconsistency. We further validated clinical utility by comparing flow velocities derived from automated and manual labels in co-registered 4D Flow MRI datasets, observing close agreement with no statistically significant differences. Our framework offers a scalable, accurate, and uncertainty-aware solution for automated cerebrovascular labeling, supporting downstream hemodynamic analysis and facilitating clinical integration."

    "summary": "Nanometer scale power amplifiers (PA) at sub-THz suffer from severe parasitic effects that lead to experience limited maximum frequency and reduced power performance at the device transceiver front end. The integrated circuits researchers proposed different PA design architecture combinations at scaled down technologies to overcome these limitations. Although the designs meet the minimum requirements, the power added efficiency (PAE) of PA is still quite low. In this paper, a W-band single-ended common-source (CS) and cascode integrated 3-stage 2-way PA design is proposed. The design integrated different key design methodologies to mitigate the parasitic; such as combined Class AB and Class A stages for gain-boosting and efficiency enhancement, Wilkinson power combiner for higher output power, linearity, and bandwidth, and transmission line (TL)-based wide band matching network for better inter-stage matching and compact size. The proposed PA design is validated using UMS 150-nm GaAs pHEMT using advanced design system (ADS) simulator. The results show that the proposed PA achieved a gain of 20.1 dB, an output power of 17.2 dBm, a PAE of 33 % and a 21 GHz bandwidth at 90 GHz Sub-THz band. The PA layout consumes only 5.66 X 2.51 mm2 die space including pads. Our proposed PA design will boost the research on sub-THz integrated circuits research and will smooth the wide spread adoption of 6G in near future."

To overcome this shortcoming, we propose an efficient compressive sensing (CS) method based on a holographic algorithm for near-field 3-D MMW imaging. An interpolation-free holographic imaging algorithm is developed and used as a sensing operator, in lieu of the nominal sensing matrix typically used in the CS iterative optimization procedure. In so doing, the problem induced by the large-scale sensing matrix is avoided. With no interpolations required, both the computational speed and the image quality can be improved. Simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in comparison with those of the Omega-K based CS and the traditional Fourier-based imaging techniques."

    "summary": "Generative text-to-image models enable us to synthesize unlimited amounts of images in a controllable manner, spurring many recent efforts to train vision models with synthetic data. However, every synthetic image ultimately originates from the upstream data used to train the generator. Does the intermediate generator provide additional information over directly training on relevant parts of the upstream data? Grounding this question in the setting of image classification, we compare finetuning on task-relevant, targeted synthetic data generated by Stable Diffusion -- a generative model trained on the LAION-2B dataset -- against finetuning on targeted real images retrieved directly from LAION-2B. We show that while synthetic data can benefit some downstream tasks, it is universally matched or outperformed by real data from the simple retrieval baseline. Our analysis suggests that this underperformance is partially due to generator artifacts and inaccurate task-relevant visual details in the synthetic images. Overall, we argue that targeted retrieval is a critical baseline to consider when training with synthetic data -- a baseline that current methods do not yet surpass. We release code, data, and models at https://github.com/scottgeng00/unmet-promise."

    "summary": "Halide perovskites constitute a chemically-diverse class of crystals with great promise as photovoltaic absorber materials, featuring band gaps between about 1 and 3.5 eV depending on composition. Their diversity calls for a general computational approach to predicting their band gaps. However, such an approach is still lacking. Here, we use density functional theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation to compute the quasiparticle or fundamental band gap of a set of ten representative halide perovskites: CH NH PbI (MAPbI ), MAPbBr , CsSnBr , (MA) BiTlBr , Cs TlAgBr , Cs TlAgCl , Cs BiAgBr , Cs InAgCl , Cs SnBr , and Cs Au I . Comparing with recent measurements, we find that a standard generalized gradient exchange-correlation functional can significantly underestimate the experimental band gaps of these perovskites, particularly in cases with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and highly dispersive band edges, to a degree that varies with composition. We show that these nonsystematic errors are inherited by one-shot G W and eigenvalue self-consistent GW calculations, demonstrating that semilocal DFT starting points are insufficient for MAPbI , MAPbBr , CsSnBr , (MA) BiTlBr , Cs TlAgBr , and Cs TlAgCl . On the other hand, we find that DFT with hybrid functionals leads to an improved starting point and GW results in better agreement with experiment for these perovskites. Our results suggest that GW with hybrid functional-based starting points are promising for predicting band gaps of systems with large SOC and dispersive bands in this technologically important class of semiconducting crystals."

    "summary": "The dynamics of magnetic reconnection in the solar current sheet (CS) is studied by high-resolution 2.5-dimensional MHD simulation. With the commence of magnetic reconnection, a number of magnetic islands are formed intermittently and move quickly upward and downward along the CS. When colliding with the semi-closed flux of flare loops, the downflow islands cause a second reconnection with a rate even comparable with that in the main CS. Though the time-integrated magnetic energy release is still dominated by the reconnection in main CS, the second reconnection can release substantial magnetic energy, annihilating the main islands and generating secondary islands with various scales at the flare loop top. The distribution function of the flux of the second islands is found to follow a power-law varying from (small scale) to (large scale), which seems to be independent with background plasma and if including thermal conduction. However, the spatial scale and the strength of the termination shocks driven by main reconnection outflows or islands decrease if increases or thermal conduction is included. We suggest that the annihilation of magnetic islands at the flare loop top, which is not included in the standard flare model, plays a non-negligible role in releasing magnetic energy to heat flare plasma and accelerate particles."

The model simulates conversations between two virtual agents, with policy gradient methods used to reward sequences that exhibit three useful conversational characteristics: the flow of informality, coherence, and simplicity of response (related to forward-looking function). We assess our model based on its diversity, length, and complexity with regard to humans. In dialogue simulation, evaluations demonstrated that the proposed model generates more interactive responses and encourages a more sustained successful conversation.

Yet, current paradigms face a difficulty-realism tension: exam-style benchmarks are often made artificially difficult with limited real-world value, while benchmarks based on real user interaction often skew toward easy, high-frequency problems. In this work, we explore a radically different paradigm: assessing models on unsolved questions. Rather than a static benchmark scored once, we curate unsolved questions and evaluate models asynchronously over time with validator-assisted screening and community verification. We introduce UQ, a testbed of 500 challenging, diverse questions sourced from Stack Exchange, spanning topics from CS theory and math to sci-fi and history, probing capabilities including reasoning, factuality, and browsing. UQ is difficult and realistic by construction: unsolved questions are often hard and naturally arise when humans seek answers, thus solving them yields direct real-world value. Our contributions are threefold: (1) UQ-Dataset and its collection pipeline combining rule-based filters, LLM judges, and human review to ensure question quality (e.g., well-defined and difficult); (2) UQ-Validators, compound validation strategies that leverage the generator-validator gap to provide evaluation signals and pre-screen candidate solutions for human review; and (3) UQ-Platform, an open platform where experts collectively verify questions and solutions. The top model passes UQ-validation on only 15% of questions, and preliminary human verification has already identified correct answers among those that passed. UQ charts a path for evaluating frontier models on real-world, open-ended challenges, where success pushes the frontier of human knowledge. We release UQ at https://uq.stanford.edu."

Methods. Since trust is a dynamic attitude that may change over time, this study aims to understand programmers' evolution of trust after immediate (one hour) and extended (10 days) use of GitHub Copilot. We collected survey data from 71 upper-division computer science students working on a legacy code base, representing a population that is about to enter the workforce. In this study, we quantitatively measure student trust levels and qualitatively uncover why student trust changes. Findings. Student trust, on average, increased over time. After completing a project with Copilot, however, students felt that Copilot requires a competent programmer to complete some tasks manually. Students mentioned that seeing Copilot's correctness, understanding how Copilot uses context from the code base, and learning some basics of natural language processing contributed to their elevated trust. Implications. Our study helps instructors and industry managers understand the factors that influence how students calibrate their trust with AI assistants. We make four pedagogical recommendations, which are that CS educators should 1) provide opportunities for students to work with Copilot on challenging software engineering tasks to calibrate their trust, 2) teach traditional skills of comprehending, debugging, and testing so students can verify output, 3) teach students about the basics of natural language processing, and 4) explicitly introduce and demonstrate the range of features available in Copilot."

    "summary": "The landscape of emerging applications has been continually widening, encompassing various data-intensive applications like artificial intelligence, machine learning, secure encryption, Internet-of-Things, etc. A sustainable approach toward creating dedicated hardware platforms that can cater to multiple applications often requires the underlying hardware to context-switch or support more than one context simultaneously. This paper presents a context-switching and dual-context memory based on the standard 8T SRAM bit-cell. Specifically, we exploit the availability of multi-VT transistors by selectively choosing the read-port transistors of the 8T SRAM cell to be either high-VT or low-VT. The 8T SRAM cell is thus augmented to store ROM data (represented as the VT of the transistors constituting the read-port) while simultaneously storing RAM data. Further, we propose specific sensing methodologies such that the memory array can support RAM-only or ROM-only mode (context-switching (CS) mode) or RAM and ROM mode simultaneously (dual-context (DC) mode). Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations have verified the robustness of our proposed ROM-augmented CS/DC memory on the Globalfoundries 22nm-FDX technology node."

The current methods focus on increasing the convolutional kernel size to enhance its performance by benefiting from the larger receptive field. However, directly increasing the size of the convolutional kernel introduces a massive amount of computational overhead and parameters. Thus, a novel Large Kernel Convolution Dehaze Block (LKD Block) consisting of the Decomposition deep-wise Large Kernel Convolution Block (DLKCB) and the Channel Enhanced Feed-forward Network (CEFN) is devised in this paper. The designed DLKCB can split the deep-wise large kernel convolution into a smaller depth-wise convolution and a depth-wise dilated convolution without introducing massive parameters and computational overhead. Meanwhile, the designed CEFN incorporates a channel attention mechanism into Feed-forward Network to exploit significant channels and enhance robustness. By combining multiple LKD Blocks and Up-Down sampling modules, the Large Kernel Convolution Dehaze Network (LKD-Net) is conducted. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed DLKCB and CEFN, and our LKD-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art. On the SOTS indoor dataset, our LKD-Net dramatically outperforms the Transformer-based method Dehamer with only 1.79% #Param and 48.9% FLOPs.

    "summary": "Fast millimeter wave (mmWave) channel estimation techniques based on compressed sensing (CS) suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the channel measurements, due to the use of wide beams. To address this problem, we develop an in-sector CS-based mmWave channel estimation technique that focuses energy on a sector in the angle domain. Specifically, we construct a new class of structured CS matrices to estimate the channel within the sector of interest. To this end, we first determine an optimal sampling pattern when the number of measurements is equal to the sector dimension and then use its subsampled version in the sub-Nyquist regime. Our approach results in low aliasing artifacts in the sector of interest and better channel estimates than benchmark algorithms."

In this paper, we study the application of power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to CRA in order to improve the performance of CRA (or increase the number of devices to be supported). We consider Gaussian spreading sequences and derive design criteria through a large-system analysis to determine the power levels for power-domain NOMA. From simulation results, we can confirm that the number of incorrectly detected device activity can be reduced by applying NOMA to CRA."

The NS picture is equivalent to the CS picture, as long as the phases in the laser fields are randomly distributed, as Mølmer argues [ 55 , 3195 (1997)]. However, the claim by Rudolph and Sanders [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87 , 077903 (2001)] has a few gaps. First, they make an assumption that is not necessarily true in the calculation of a density operator involved with a two-mode squeezed state. We show that there exists entanglement in the density operator without defying the assumption that phases are randomly distributed. Moreover, using a concept of picture-invariance, we argue that it is not that criteria for quantum teleportation are not satisfied. We discuss an analogy between the controversy on the CS versus NS pictures to that on the heliocentric versus geocentric pictures."

Using the matrix model of Kapustin, Willett and Yaakov, we examine the Euclidean partition function of these theories on an S^3 in the large N limit. We show that the only such CS theories for which the long range forces between the eigenvalues cancel have quivers which are in one-to-one correspondence with the simply laced affine Dynkin diagrams. As the A_n series was studied in detail before, in this paper we compute the partition function for the D_4 quiver. The D_4 example gives further evidence for a conjecture that the saddle point eigenvalue distribution is determined by the distribution of gauge invariant chiral operators. We also see that the partition function is invariant under a generalized Seiberg duality for CS theories."

We find that these properties are qualitatively largely similar in both cases, meaning that the SCS density can be employed as an alternative to the CS term also in higher dimensions, most importantly in even dimensions where no CS term is defined, in dimensions. The SCS density employed here is defined in terms of the pair of gauge fields and an auxiliary Skyrme scalar, which is contracted to an effective Skyrme scalar. Technically, this study maps the methods to be applied in higher dimensional examples."

    "summary": "Given the incomplete sampling of spatial frequencies by radio interferometers, achieving precise restoration of astrophysical information remains challenging. To address this ill-posed problem, compressive sensing(CS) provides a robust framework for stable and unique recovery of sky brightness distributions in noisy environments, contingent upon satisfying specific conditions. We explore the applicability of CS theory and find that for radio interferometric telescopes, the conditions can be simplified to sparse representation. Building on this insight, we develop a deep dictionary (realized through a convolutional neural network), which is designed to be multi-resolution and overcomplete, to achieve sparse representation and integrate it within the CS framework. The resulting method is a novel, fully interpretable unsupervised learning approach that combines the mathematical rigor of CS with the expressive power of deep neural networks, effectively bridging the gap between deep learning and classical dictionary methods. During the deconvolution process, the model image and the deep dictionary are updated alternatively. This approach enables efficient and accurate recovery of extended sources with complex morphologies from noisy measurements. Comparative analyses with state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method, i.e., achieving a dynamic range (DR) nearly 45 to 100 times higher than that of multiscale CLEAN (MS-CLEAN)."

However, there is still room for improvement and exploration regarding variants of the Huffman problem. Length-limited Huffman coding, useful for many practical applications, is one such variant, for which codes are restricted to the set of codes in which none of the codewords is longer than a given length, . Binary length-limited coding can be done in time and O(n) space via the widely used Package-Merge algorithm and with even smaller asymptotic complexity using a lesser-known algorithm. In this paper these algorithms are generalized without increasing complexity in order to introduce a minimum codeword length constraint , to allow for objective functions other than the minimization of expected codeword length, and to be applicable to both binary and nonbinary codes; nonbinary codes were previously addressed using a slower dynamic programming approach. These extensions have various applications -- including fast decompression and a modified version of the game ``Twenty Questions'' -- and can be used to solve the problem of finding an optimal code with limited fringe, that is, finding the best code among codes with a maximum difference between the longest and shortest codewords. The previously proposed method for solving this problem was nonpolynomial time, whereas solving this using the novel linear-space algorithm requires only time, or even less if is not ."

    "summary": "The way developers implement their algorithms and how these implementations behave on modern CPUs are governed by the design and organization of these. The vectorization units (SIMD) are among the few CPUs' parts that can and must be explicitly controlled. In the HPC community, the x86 CPUs and their vectorization instruction sets were de-facto the standard for decades. Each new release of an instruction set was usually a doubling of the vector length coupled with new operations. Each generation was pushing for adapting and improving previous implementations. The release of the ARM scalable vector extension (SVE) changed things radically for several reasons. First, we expect ARM processors to equip many supercomputers in the next years. Second, SVE's interface is different in several aspects from the x86 extensions as it provides different instructions, uses a predicate to control most operations, and has a vector size that is only known at execution time. Therefore, using SVE opens new challenges on how to adapt algorithms including the ones that are already well-optimized on x86. In this paper, we port a hybrid sort based on the well-known Quicksort and Bitonic-sort algorithms. We use a Bitonic sort to process small partitions/arrays and a vectorized partitioning implementation to divide the partitions. We explain how we use the predicates and how we manage the non-static vector size. We explain how we efficiently implement the sorting kernels. Our approach only needs an array of O(log N) for the recursive calls in the partitioning phase, both in the sequential and in the parallel case. We test the performance of our approach on a modern ARMv8.2 and assess the different layers of our implementation by sorting/partitioning integers, double floating-point numbers, and key/value pairs of integers. Our approach is faster than the GNU C++ sort algorithm by a speedup factor of 4 on average."

The East-West outflow originating from this source has been mapped in four transitions of both SO and SO2. In addition, CS observations published in the literature have been used. We compute the SO, SO2 and CS column densities and the physical conditions at several positions of the outflow using LTE and a non-LTE LVG approximations. The SO2/SO and CS/SO abundance ratios are compared with the theoretical predictions of a chemical model adapted to the physical conditions in the IRAS2 outflow. The SO2/SO abundance ratios are constant in the two lobes of the outflow whereas CS/SO is up to 6 times lower in the shocked gas of the East lobe than in the West one. The comparison with the chemical model allows us to constrain the age of the outflow produced by IRAS2 to >5e3yr. We find low densities and temperatures for the outflow of IRAS2 ( 70 K) from SO and SO2 emission probably because the two molecules trace the cooled entrained material. The East lobe of the outflow shows denser gas compared to the West lobe. We also discuss some constraints on the depleted form of sulphur."

Materials and Methods: Learning was performed for a range of DL architectures (VarNet, 3D UNet, FastDVDNet) and corresponding sampling patterns (Cartesian, radial, spiral) either from true multi-coil cardiac MR data (N=692) or from pseudo-MR data simulated from Inter4K natural videos (N=692). Real-time undersampled dynamic MR images were reconstructed using DL networks trained with cardiac data and natural videos, and compressed sensing (CS). Differences were assessed in simulations (N=104 datasets) in terms of MSE, PSNR, and SSIM and prospectively for cardiac (short axis, four chambers, N=20) and speech (N=10) data in terms of subjective image quality ranking, SNR and Edge sharpness. Friedman Chi Square tests with post-hoc Nemenyi analysis were performed to assess statistical significance. Results: For all simulation metrics, DL networks trained with cardiac data outperformed DL networks trained with natural videos, which outperformed CS (p 0.85). Conclusion: The developed pipeline enabled learning dynamic MR reconstruction from natural videos preserving DL reconstruction advantages such as high quality fast and ultra-fast reconstructions while overcoming some limitations (data scarcity or sharing).

Comparing the performance of our improved -Catoni-type CS with the bound in the above cited paper indicates that our CS achieves tighter width."

Although the column density of H CS is smaller than that of H CO, both species show similar D-enhancements in their singly and doubly deuterated species. A chemical model -including multiply deuterated species- has been used in order to interpret the observations. Predicted rotational frequencies from laboratory data for HDCS and D CS are significantly in error when compared to the observed frequencies in Space. Consequently, we have derived new rotational constants for these two species and for H CS and H C S using the observed frequencies in Barnard 1. The new rotational constants allow to predict the rotational transitions of these species with the accuracy needed for the narrow line emerging from dark clouds. Rotational constants for HDCS and D CS have been obtained from the observed transitions in the laboratory and in Space."

The evolution of the CS ensemble with randomly switching topologies involves two random components (switching times and choices of network topologies at switching instant). First, we allow switching times for the network topology to be random so that the successive increments are i.i.d. processes following the common probability distribution. Second, at each switching instant, we choose a network topology randomly from a finite set of admissible network topologies whose union contains a spanning tree. Even for the fixed deterministic network topology, the CS ensemble may not exhibit a mono-cluster flocking depending on the initial data and the decay mode of the communication weight functions measuring the degree of interactions between particles. For the flocking dynamics of the CS ensemble with these two random components, we first use a priori conditions on the network topologies and uniform boundedness of position diameter, and derive the flocking estimates via matrix theory together with a priori conditions, and then replace the a priori condition for the position diameter by some suitable condition on the system parameters and communication weight. The a priori condition on the network topology will be guaranteed by the suitable spanning tree time-blocks with probability one."

Recently, photonic time-stretch (PTS) technique facilitates the emergence of high-speed single-pixel cameras. A significant breakthrough in imaging speed of single-pixel cameras enables observation of fast dynamic phenomena. However, according to CS theory, image reconstruction is an iterative process that consumes enormous amounts of computational time and cannot be performed in real time. To address this challenge, we propose a novel single-pixel imaging technique that can produce high-quality images through rapid acquisition of their effective spatial Fourier spectrum. We employ phase-shifting sinusoidal structured illumination instead of random illumination for spectrum acquisition and apply inverse Fourier transform to the obtained spectrum for image restoration. We evaluate the performance of our prototype system by recognizing quick response (QR) codes and flow cytometric screening of cells. A frame rate of 625 kHz and a compression ratio of 10% are experimentally demonstrated in accordance with the recognition rate of the QR code. An imaging flow cytometer enabling high-content screening with an unprecedented throughput of 100,000 cells/s is also demonstrated.

It achieves this by separating the Hamiltonian into contextual and noncontextual parts. The ground-state energy is approximated by classically solving the noncontextual problem, followed by solving the contextual problem using VQE, constrained by the noncontextual solution. In general, computation of the contextual correction needs fewer qubits and measurements compared with solving the full Hamiltonian via traditional VQE. We simulate CS-VQE on different tapered molecular Hamiltonians and apply the unitary partitioning measurement reduction strategy to further reduce the number of measurements required to obtain the contextual correction. Our results indicate that CS-VQE combined with measurement reduction is a promising approach to allow feasible eigenvalue computations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We also provide a modification to the CS-VQE algorithm; the CS-VQE algorithm previously could cause an exponential increase in Hamiltonian terms, but with this modification now at worst will scale quadratically."

The 1.2 mm continuum map reveals, for the first time, a total of 9 compact (r < 0.01pc) dust condensations located within a distance of ~0.03 pc from the dissociation front of the PDR. Part of the dust condensations are seen in spectral line emissions of CS (5-4) and H CS ( - ), though the CS map also reveals dense gas further away from the dissociation front. We detect compact emissions in H CS ( - ), ( - ) and C S, C S (4-3) toward bright dust condensations. The line ratio of H CS ( - )/( - ) suggests a temperature of K. A non-thermal velocity dispersion of ~0.25 - 0.50 km s is derived from the high spectral resolution C S data, and indicates a subsonic to transonic turbulence in the condensations. The masses of the condensations are estimated from the dust emission, and range from 0.03 to 0.3 , all significantly lower than any critical mass that is required for self-gravity to play a crucial role. Thus the condensations are not gravitationally bound, and could not collapse to form stars. In cooperating with recent high resolution observations of the surface layers of the molecular cloud in the Bar, we speculate that the condensations are produced as a high-pressure wave induced by the expansion of the HII region compresses and enters the cloud. A velocity gradient along a direction perpendicular to the major axis of the Bar is seen in H CS ( - ), and is consistent with the scenario that the molecular gas behind the dissociation front is being compressed."

Moreover, in these applications it is often not necessary to know the support of the signal exactly, but instead small errors in the support and signal are tolerable. Despite the abundance of work utilizing incoherent sensing matrices, for this type of tolerant recovery we suggest that coherence is actually beneficial. We promote the use of coherent sampling when tolerant support recovery is acceptable, and demonstrate its advantages empirically. In addition, we provide a first step towards theoretical analysis by considering a specific reconstruction method for selected signal classes."

All sources are detected in CS J=2-1 showing the existence of CS clumps around the IRAS sources. However, one-third of the sources are not deeply embedded in the dense clumps by comparison of the central powering IRAS sources and the morphologies of CS clumps. Physical parameters of the dense molecular clumps are presented. We have identified 12 high-mass protostellar object (HMPO) candidates by checking the association between the dense cores and the IRAS sources, the detection of water maser, and the radio properties towards the IRAS sources. We find that the HMPO sources are characterized by low FIR luminosity to virial mass ratios since they are in very early evolutionary stages when the massive protostars have not reached their full luminosities, which are typical for zero-age main sequence stars. Large turbulent motion in the HMPO sources may be largely due to the large kinetic energy ejected by the central protostars formed in the dense clumps. However, alternative means or undetected outflows may also be responsible for the turbulence in the clumps."

Setting accurate constraints to the parameters of the theory is important owing to their implications for the scalar field and/or the underlying fundamental theory. The current best constraints rely on measurements of the periastron precession rate in the double-binary-pulsar system and place a very tight bound on the characteristic CS lengthscale k_cs^ -1 <~ 3*10^ -9 km. This paper considers several effects that were not accounted for when deriving this bound and lead to a substantial suppression of the predicted rate of periastron precession. It is shown, in particular, that the point mass approximation for extended test bodies does not apply in this case. The constraint to the characteristic CS lengthscale is revised to k_cs^ -1 <~ 0.4 km, eight orders of magnitude weaker than what was previously found."

Diffusion Tensor Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (DT-CMR) is a unique non-invasive technique that can resolve the microscopic structure, organisation, and integrity of the myocardium without the need for exogenous contrast agents. However, this technique suffers from relatively low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and frequent signal loss due to respiratory and cardiac motion. Current DT-CMR techniques rely on acquiring and averaging multiple signal acquisitions to improve the SNR. Moreover, in order to mitigate the influence of respiratory movement, patients are required to perform many breath holds which results in prolonged acquisition durations (e.g., ~30 mins using the existing technology). In this study, we propose a novel cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based compressive sensing (CS) technique and explore its applicability to improve DT-CMR acquisitions. Our simulation based studies have achieved high reconstruction fidelity and good agreement between DT-CMR parameters obtained with the proposed reconstruction and fully sampled ground truth. When compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our proposed deep cascaded CNN method and its stochastic variation demonstrated significant improvements. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using deep CNN based CS for the DT-CMR reconstruction. In addition, with relatively straightforward modifications to the acquisition scheme, our method can easily be translated into a method for online, at-the-scanner reconstruction enabling the deployment of accelerated DT-CMR in various clinical applications."

The IR limit of these 2D EFTs should represent the action of F1 strings in type IIA. The CS term reduces to a particular Phi*F term and the scalars and fermions get \"mass\" terms.

    "title": "Learning-based Sketches for Frequency Estimation in Data Streams without Ground Truth",
    "summary": "Estimating the frequency of items on the high-volume, fast data stream has been extensively studied in many areas, such as database and network measurement. Traditional sketches provide only coarse estimates under strict memory constraints. Although some learning-augmented methods have emerged recently, they typically rely on offline training with real frequencies or/and labels, which are often unavailable. Moreover, these methods suffer from slow update speeds, limiting their suitability for real-time processing despite offering only marginal accuracy improvements. To overcome these challenges, we propose UCL-sketch, a practical learning-based paradigm for per-key frequency estimation. Our design introduces two key innovations: (i) an online training mechanism based on equivalent learning that requires no ground truth (GT), and (ii) a highly scalable architecture leveraging logically structured estimation buckets to scale to real-world data stream. The UCL-sketch, which utilizes compressive sensing (CS), converges to an estimator that provably yields a error bound far lower than that of prior works, without sacrificing the speed of processing. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms previously proposed approaches regarding per-key accuracy and distribution. Notably, under extremely tight memory budgets, its quality almost matches that of an (infeasible) omniscient oracle. Moreover, compared to the existing equation-based sketch, UCL-sketch achieves an average decoding speedup of nearly 500 times. To help further research and development, our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Y-debug-sys/UCL-sketch."

The theoretical predictions obtained by AGB models at different masses, s-process efficiencies, dilution factors and initial r-enrichment, are compared with spectroscopic observations of Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor stars enriched in s-process elements, CEMP(s), collected from the literature. We discuss here five stars as example, CS 22880-074, CS 22942-019, CS 29526-110, HE 0202-2204, and LP 625-44. All these objects lie on the main-sequence or on the giant phase, clearly before the TP-AGB stage: the hypothesis of mass transfer from an AGB companion, would explain the observed s-process enhancement. CS 29526-110 and LP 625-44 are CEMP(s+r) objects, and are interpreted assuming that the molecular cloud, from which the binary system formed, was already enriched in r-process elements by SNII pollution. In several cases, the observed s-process distribution may be accounted for AGB models of different initial masses with proper 13C-pocket efficiency and dilution factor. Na (and Mg), produced via the neutron capture chain starting from 22Ne, may provide an indicator of the initial AGB mass."

Comparing with the case of a Kerr black hole, we observe that the presence of the dilation parameter makes the CS invariant more complex, and changes the range of the coupling parameter and the spin parameter where the chaotic motion appears for the scalar particle. Moreover, we find that the coupling parameter together with the spin parameter also affects the range of the dilation parameter where the chaos occurs. We also probe the effects of the dilation parameter on the chaotic strength of the chaotic orbits for the coupled particle. Our results indicate that the coupling between the CS invariant and the scalar particle yields the richer dynamical behavior of the particle in the rotating EMDA black hole spacetime."

    "title": "Harmonics to the Rescue: Why Voiced Speech is Not a Wss Process",
    "summary": "Speech processing algorithms often rely on statistical knowledge of the underlying process. Despite many years of research, however, the debate on the most appropriate statistical model for speech still continues. Speech is commonly modeled as a wide-sense stationary (WSS) process. However, the use of the WSS model for spectrally correlated processes is fundamentally wrong, as WSS implies spectral uncorrelation. In this paper, we demonstrate that voiced speech can be more accurately represented as a cyclostationary (CS) process. By employing the CS rather than the WSS model for processes that are inherently correlated across frequency, it is possible to improve the estimation of cross-power spectral densities (PSDs), source separation, and beamforming. We illustrate how the correlation between harmonic frequencies of CS processes can enhance system identification, and validate our findings using both simulated and real speech data."

    "title": "UB-FineNet: Urban Building Fine-grained Classification Network for Open-access Satellite Images",
    "summary": "Fine classification of city-scale buildings from satellite remote sensing imagery is a crucial research area with significant implications for urban planning, infrastructure development, and population distribution analysis. However, the task faces big challenges due to low-resolution overhead images acquired from high altitude space-borne platforms and the long-tail sample distribution of fine-grained urban building categories, leading to severe class imbalance problem. To address these issues, we propose a deep network approach to fine-grained classification of urban buildings using open-access satellite images. A Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) based super-resolution method is first introduced to enhance the spatial resolution of satellite images, which benefits from domain-adaptive knowledge distillation. Then, a new fine-grained classification network with Category Information Balancing Module (CIBM) and Contrastive Supervision (CS) technique is proposed to mitigate the problem of class imbalance and improve the classification robustness and accuracy. Experiments on Hong Kong data set with 11 fine building types revealed promising classification results with a mean Top-1 accuracy of 60.45\\%, which is on par with street-view image based approaches. Extensive ablation study shows that CIBM and CS improve Top-1 accuracy by 2.6\\% and 3.5\\% compared to the baseline method, respectively. And both modules can be easily inserted into other classification networks and similar enhancements have been achieved. Our research contributes to the field of urban analysis by providing a practical solution for fine classification of buildings in challenging mega city scenarios solely using open-access satellite images. The proposed method can serve as a valuable tool for urban planners, aiding in the understanding of economic, industrial, and population distribution."

The obtained spectra are characterized by the water band near 180 cm-1 and by several DNA bands near 100 cm-1. The main difference between Na- and Cs-DNA spectra is observed in case of the band 100 cm-1. In Cs-DNA spectra this band has about twice higher intensity than in Na-DNA spectra. The comparison of obtained spectra with the calculated frequencies of Na- and Cs-DNA conformational vibrations [Perepelytsya S.M., Volkov S.N. Eur. Phys. J. E. 24, 261 (2007)] show that the band 100 cm-1 in the spectra of Cs-DNA is formed by the modes of both H-bond stretching vibrations and vibrations of caesium counterions, while in Na-DNA spectra the band 100 cm-1 is formed by the mode of H-bond stretching vibrations only. The modes of sodium counterion vibrations have a frequency 180 cm-1, and they do not rise above the water band. Thus, the increase in intensity of the band 100 cm-1 in the spectra of Cs-DNA as compared with Na-DNA is caused by the mode of ion-phosphate vibrations."

Beside the standard stability analysis of equilibria, the divergence of fractional order is proposed to determine the instability of the equilibria. The bifurcation diagrams versus the fractional order, and versus one parameter, reveal a strange phenomenon suggesting that the bifurcation branches generated by initial conditions outside neighborhoods of unstable equilibria are spurious sets although they look similar with those generated by initial conditions close to the equilibria. These spurious sets look ``delayed'' in the considered bifurcation scenario. Once the integration step-size is reduced, the spurious branches maintain their shapes but tend to the branches obtained from initial condition within neighborhoods of equilibria. While the spurious branches move once the integration step size reduces, the branches generated by the initial conditions near the equilibria maintain their positions in the considered bifurcation space. This phenomenon does not depend on the integration-time interval, and repeats in the parameter bifurcation space."

Moreover a transition between these two different regimes is found for each investigated salt concentration. It is clear from these measurements that a revision of the phase diagram is necessary and a new \"transition\" line between two different arrested states is drawn."

Instead of directly solving the unconstrained L0 norm optimization problem, we use the linearization and proximal points techniques to approximate the penalty function at each iteration.

CSs, whose detection would provide a unique probe of high-energy physics and the early Universe, possess distinct topological and geometric features that require a dedicated search strategy. Our approach employs a full-wave transmission factor, expressed analytically via Fresnel integrals, which captures the characteristic diffraction and interference effects of the conical spacetime around a straight CS. We contrast CS lensing with the well-studied point mass lens (PML) model, highlighting their fundamental differences: CS lensing depends on cosmological distances, string tension , and wavelength , and produces two non-amplified images set by the global conical geometry. In contrast, PML lensing is governed by the distance-independent ratio , where represents the redshifted mass of the lens, with image properties derived from the lens equation. For BBH mergers lensed by CSs, we show that the waveforms exhibit a characteristic beating pattern or time-separated, exact replicas. We derive a detectability bound on the string tension and, using Bayesian model selection, demonstrate that CS lensing is distinguishable from both unlensed and PML-lensed signals across a wide region of parameter space."

Starting from sparsity, recovery methods have steadily moved towards more complex structures. Emerging machine learning tools such as generative functions that are based on neural networks are able to learn general complex structures from training data. This makes them potentially powerful tools for designing CS algorithms. Consider a desired class of signals , , and a corresponding generative function , , such that . A recovery method based on seeks with minimum measurement error. In this paper, the performance of such a recovery method is studied, under both noisy and noiseless measurements. In the noiseless case, roughly speaking, it is proven that, as and grow without bound and converges to zero, if the number of measurements ( ) is larger than the input dimension of the generative model ( ), then asymptotically, almost lossless recovery is possible. Furthermore, the performance of an efficient iterative algorithm based on projected gradient descent is studied. In this case, an auto-encoder is used to define and enforce the source structure at the projection step. The auto-encoder is defined by encoder and decoder (generative) functions and , respectively. We theoretically prove that, roughly, given measurements, such an algorithm converges to the vicinity of the desired result, even in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise.

Applying process mining techniques on data from smart home environments has the potential to provide valuable insights in (un)healthy habits and to contribute to ambient assisted living solutions. Finding the right event labels to enable application of process mining techniques is however far from trivial, as simply using the triggering sensor as the label for sensor events results in uninformative models that allow for too much behavior (overgeneralizing). Refinements of sensor level event labels suggested by domain experts have shown to enable discovery of more precise and insightful process models. However, there exist no automated approach to generate refinements of event labels in the context of process mining. In this paper we propose a framework for automated generation of label refinements based on the time attribute of events. We show on a case study with real life smart home event data that behaviorally more specific, and therefore more insightful, process models can be found by using automatically generated refined labels in process discovery."

With fixed layouts of roadside buildings and regular vehicular moving trajectory, the dominant path directions of channels will likely be among a subset of beam directions instead of distributing randomly over the whole beamspace. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based technique to design a structured compressed sensing (CS) matrix that is well suited to the underlying channel distribution for mmWave vehicular beam alignment. The proposed approach leverages both sparsity and the particular spatial structure that appears in vehicular channels. We model the compressive channel acquisition by a two-dimensional (2D) convolutional layer followed by dropout. We design fully-connected layers to optimize channel acquisition and beam alignment. We incorporate the low-resolution phase shifter constraint during neural network training by using projected gradient descent for weight updates. Furthermore, we exploit channel spectral structure to optimize the power allocated for different subcarriers. Simulations indicate that our deep learning-based approach achieves better beam alignment than standard CS techniques which use random phase shift-based design. Numerical experiments also show that one single subcarrier is sufficient to provide necessary information for beam alignment."

The formulation of higher spin gauge field theories, along with a Chern-Simons (CS) like term for fields of higher spins is presented. Through this setup, general features of theories describing massless/massive fields of higher spin in arbitrary dimensions is discussed. In 2+1 dimensions, the existence of multiple mass-generating mechanisms i.e. metric-based masses and topological masses, offers the possibility for gauge bosons to acquire mixed masses. This scenario is first introduced in a theory of photons where both Proca mass term and CS mass term is simultaneously present. The mass-mixing which occurs in this theory is further analysed through the Stückelberg formalism. Motivated by these results, a theory of massive gravity where gravitons obtain masses from both Fierz-Pauli mass term and CS mass term is studied. This theory allows for 3 propagating massive graviton modes, and their masses have undergone considerable mixing. This mass-mixing is made explicit through a Stückelberg analysis. The bimetric theory of gravity is a non-trivial generalization of the theory of General Relativity. This theory provides a consistent non-linear theory of massive gravity which is studied in detail. In this thesis, the bimetric theory of gravity is extended in 2+1 dimensiosn to the theory of Topologically Massive Bimetric Gravity (TMBG). In the theory of TMBG, the mass-mixing which arises from the interaction of the two metrics and their corresponding CS terms occurs at the nonlinear stage itself. For the version of TMBG studied in this thesis, the linearized theory shows that there are 3 massive graviton modes, which corresponds to the same 3 modes found earlier. Finally, quantum loop corrections to the graviton propagator from massive photons (which acquire mass from both CS and Proca mechanism) is calculated."

Li and Cs loss by inelastic inter-species collisions can completely be attributed to processes involving optically excited cesium (fine-structure changing collisions and radiative escape). By lowering the trap depth for Li, an additional loss channel of Li is observed which results from ground-state Li-Cs collisions changing the hyperfine state of cesium."

    "title": "Suppressing Gradient Conflict for Generalizable Deepfake Detection",
    "summary": "Robust deepfake detection models must be capable of generalizing to ever-evolving manipulation techniques beyond training data. A promising strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules. First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type. Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization."

Three advantages are frequently cited in favor of subwords: shorter encoding of frequent tokens, compositionality of subwords, and ability to deal with unknown words. As their relative importance is not entirely clear yet, we propose a tokenization approach that enables us to separate frequency (the first advantage) from compositionality. The approach uses Huffman coding to tokenize words, by order of frequency, using a fixed amount of symbols. Experiments with CS-DE, EN-FR and EN-DE NMT show that frequency alone accounts for 90%-95% of the scores reached by BPE, hence compositionality has less importance than previously thought."

In particular, in the case of singular interactions between agents, as is the case of the CS model with communication weights of the type for , it is important for showing global well-posedness of the underlying particle dynamics. In [4], a proof of the non-collision property for singular interactions is given in the case of the linear CS model, i.e. when the velocity coupling between agents is . This paper can be seen as an extension of the analysis in [4]. We show that particles avoid collisions even when the linear coupling in the CS system has been substituted with the nonlinear term introduced in [12] (typical examples being for ), and prove that no collisions can happen in finite time when . We also show uniform estimates for the minimum inter-particle distance, for a communication weight with expanded singularity , when , ."

    "title": "Deep Learning Based Frequency-Selective Channel Estimation for Hybrid mmWave MIMO Systems",
    "summary": "Millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems typically employ hybrid mixed signal processing to avoid expensive hardware and high training overheads. However, the lack of fully digital beamforming at mmWave bands imposes additional challenges in channel estimation. Prior art on hybrid architectures has mainly focused on greedy optimization algorithms to estimate frequency-flat narrowband mmWave channels, despite the fact that in practice, the large bandwidth associated with mmWave channels results in frequency-selective channels. In this paper, we consider a frequency-selective wideband mmWave system and propose two deep learning (DL) compressive sensing (CS) based algorithms for channel estimation. The proposed algorithms learn critical apriori information from training data to provide highly accurate channel estimates with low training overhead. In the first approach, a DL-CS based algorithm simultaneously estimates the channel supports in the frequency domain, which are then used for channel reconstruction. The second approach exploits the estimated supports to apply a low-complexity multi-resolution fine-tuning method to further enhance the estimation performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DL-based schemes significantly outperform conventional orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) techniques in terms of the normalized mean-squared error (NMSE), computational complexity, and spectral efficiency, particularly in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime. When compared to OMP approaches that achieve an NMSE gap of \\ with respect to the Cramer Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), the proposed algorithms reduce the CRLB gap to only \\ , while significantly reducing complexity by two orders of magnitude."

To understand this new mechanism, conceptually and practically, we employ a formulation using non-integer dimension, which is equivalent to the strength of an external oscillator field. The effect most clearly appears when the crucial two-body systems are unbound in three, but bound in two, dimensions. We discuss energy variation, conditions for occurrence, and number of Efimov states, as functions of the dimension. We use practical examples from cold atom physics of Cs- Cs- Cs, Rb- Rb- Rb, Cs- Cs- Li, and Rb- Rb- K. Laboratory tests of the effect can be performed with two independent parameters, i.e. the external one-body field and the Feshbach two-body tuning. The scaling and (dis)appearance of these Efimov states occur precisely as already found in three dimensions."

Complemented subsets were used successfully by Bishop in his constructive formulation of the Daniell approach to measure and integration. Here we use complemented subsets in topology, in order to describe simultaneously an open set, the first-component of an open complemented subset, together with its given complement as a closed set, the second component of an open complemented subset. We analyse the canonical cs-topology induced by a metric, and we introduce the notion of a modulus of openness for a cs-open subset of a metric space. Pointwise and uniform continuity of functions between metric spaces are formulated with respect to the way these functions inverse open complemented subsets together with their moduli of openness. The addition of moduli of openness in the concept of a complemented open subset, given a base for the cs-topology, makes possible to define the notions of pointwise-like and uniform-like continuity of functions between csb-spaces, that is cs-spaces with a given base."

Based on dual theory of linear programming and the relationship with flow games, we provide the characterizations on the CS-core, least-core and nucleolus of path cooperative games. Furthermore, we show that the least-core and nucleolus are polynomially solvable for path cooperative games defined on both directed and undirected network."

We show that the fermion-fermion interactions mediated by the dynamic CS flux attachment may give rise to Cooper pairing of the fermions. Specifically, in an XY model on the honeycomb lattice, this construction leads to a \"CS superconductor,\" which belongs to a topologically non-trivial in 2D symmetry class DIII, with particle-hole and time-reversal symmetries. It is shown that in the original spin language, this state corresponds to a symmetry protected topological state, which coexists with a magnetic long-range order. We discuss physical manifestations of the topological character of the corresponding state and requirements for models that could host it."

    "title": "The Interaction of Type Ia Supernovae with their Surroundings: The Exponential profile in 2D",
    "summary": "The evolution of Type Ia supernovae in the surrounding medium is studied using 2-dimensional numerical hydrodynamic simulations. The ejecta are assumed to be described by an exponential density profile, following the work of Dwarkadas & Chevalier (1998). The case of a circumstellar (CS) region formed by mass loss from the progenitor or a companion star is also considered. The decelerating contact discontinuity is found to be Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) unstable, as expected, and the nature of the instability is studied in detail for 2 cases: 1) a constant density ambient medium, and 2) a CS medium whose density goes as r^ -2 . The nature of the instability is found to be different in both cases. In the case of a CS medium the instability is much better resolved, and a fractal-like structure is seen. In the case of a constant density medium the extent of growth is less, and the R-T fingers are found to be limited by the presence of Kelvin-Helmholtz mushroom caps at the tips of the fingers. The unstable region is far enough away from the reverse shock that the latter is not affected by the mixing taking place in the interaction region. In contrast the reverse shock in the case of a CS medium is found to be rippled due to the formation of instabilities. In neither case is the outer shock front affected. These results are consistent with similar studies of power-law ejecta profiles conducted by Chevalier, Blondin & Emmering (1992). Our results are then applied to Tycho's supernova remnant."

Shell stars are early-type stars with narrow absorption lines in their spectra that appear to arise from circumstellar (CS) gas. Four of the 16 stars in our survey showed excess emission at 24 microns and 70 microns characteristic of cool CS dust and are likely to be edge-on debris disks. Including previously known disks, it appears that the fraction of protoplanetary and debris disks among the main sequence shell stars is at least 48% +/- 14%. While dust in debris disks has been extensively studied, relatively little is known about their gas content. In the case of Beta Pictoris, extensive observations of gaseous species have provided insights into the dynamics of the CS material and surprises about the composition of the CS gas coming from young planetesimals (e.g. Roberge et al. 2006). To understand the co-evolution of gas and dust through the terrestrial planet formation phase, we need to study the gas in additional debris disks. The new debris disk candidates from this Spitzer survey double the number of systems in which the gas can be observed right now with sensitive line of sight absorption spectroscopy."

    "title": "Data Heterogeneity-Robust Federated Learning via Group Client Selection in Industrial IoT",
    "summary": "Nowadays, the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has played an integral role in Industry 4.0 and produced massive amounts of data for industrial intelligence. These data locate on decentralized devices in modern factories. To protect the confidentiality of industrial data, federated learning (FL) was introduced to collaboratively train shared machine learning models. However, the local data collected by different devices skew in class distribution and degrade industrial FL performance. This challenge has been widely studied at the mobile edge, but they ignored the rapidly changing streaming data and clustering nature of factory devices, and more seriously, they may threaten data security. In this paper, we propose FedGS, which is a hierarchical cloud-edge-end FL framework for 5G empowered industries, to improve industrial FL performance on non-i.i.d. data. Taking advantage of naturally clustered factory devices, FedGS uses a gradient-based binary permutation algorithm (GBP-CS) to select a subset of devices within each factory and build homogeneous super nodes participating in FL training. Then, we propose a compound-step synchronization protocol to coordinate the training process within and among these super nodes, which shows great robustness against data heterogeneity. The proposed methods are time-efficient and can adapt to dynamic environments, without exposing confidential industrial data in risky manipulation. We prove that FedGS has better convergence performance than FedAvg and give a relaxed condition under which FedGS is more communication-efficient. Extensive experiments show that FedGS improves accuracy by 3.5% and reduces training rounds by 59% on average, confirming its superior effectiveness and efficiency on non-i.i.d. data."

    "summary": "This paper introduces a novel framework for single-pixel imaging via compressive sensing (CS) in shift-invariant (SI) spaces by exploiting the sparsity property of a wavelet representation. We reinterpret the acquisition procedure of a single-pixel camera as filtering of the observed signal with continuous-domain functions that lie in an SI subspace spanned by the integer shifts of the box function. The signal is modeled by an arbitrary SI generator whose special case is the box function, which, as we show in the paper, is conventionally used in single-pixel imaging. We propose to use separable B-spline generators which are intuitively complemented by sparsity-inducing spline wavelets. The SI models of the acquisition and the underlying signal lead to an exact discretization of an inherently continuous-domain inverse problem to a finite-dimensional problem of CS type. By solving the CS optimization problem, a parametric representation of the signal is obtained. Such a representation offers many practical advantages in image processing applications. We propose an efficient matrix-free implementation of the framework and conduct it on the standard test images and real-world measurement data. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a significant improvement of the reconstruction quality relative to the conventional discretization in CS setups. MATLAB implementation of the method described in this paper has been made publicly available on https://github.com/retiro/compressive_imaging_in_si_spaces."

The N2H+ spectra are optically thin and fits to the 7 hyperfine components are used to determine the distribution of velocity dispersion. 8 cores, 2 with continuum sources, 6 without, lie at a local linewidth minimum and optical depth maximum. The CS spectra are optically thick and generally self-absorbed over the full 0.2 pc extent of the map. We use the line wings to trace outflows around at least 3, and possibly 4, of the continuum sources, and the asymmetry in the self-absorption as a diagnostic of relative motions between core centers and envelopes. The quiescent regions with low N2H+ linewidth tend to have more asymmetric CS spectra than the spectra around the continuum sources indicating higher infall speeds. These regions have typical sizes ~5000 AU, linewidths ~0.5 km/s, and infall speeds ~0.05 km/s. The correlation of CS asymmetry with N2H+ velocity dispersion suggests that the inward flows of material that build up pre-protostellar cores are driven at least partly by a pressure gradient rather than by gravity alone. We discuss a scenario for core formation and eventual star forming collapse through the dissipation of turbulence."

Then, this model is adapted sequentially over time to a new patient using domain adaptive GPs to form the patient's pGP. We show that this new approach, together with an auto-regressive formulation, leads to significant improvements in forecasting future clinical status and cognitive scores for target patients when compared to modeling the population with traditional GPs."

Up to date the theoretical modelling of these systems have relied on primitive approximations to the density functional theory (DFT). In this paper, we study structural, electronic and magnetic properties of the Fe -containing HDPs Cs AgFeCl and Cs NaFeCl using a combination of more advanced DFT-based methods, including DFT+U, hybrid-DFT and treatments of various magnetic states. We examine the effect of varying the effective Hubbard parameter, U , in DFT+U and the mixing-parameter, , in hybrid DFT on the electronic structure and structural properties. Our results reveal a set of localized Fe(d) states that are highly sensitive to these parameters. Cs AgFeCl and Cs NaFeCl are both antiferromagnets with Neél temperatures well below room temperature and are thus in their paramagnetic (PM) state at the external conditions relevant to most applications. Therefore, we have examined the effect of disordered magnetism on the electronic structure of these systems and find that while Cs NaFeCl is largely unaffected, Cs AgFeCl shows significant renormalization of its electronic band structure."

By scanning the 698-nm coupling laser's frequency, the Doppler-free high-resolution electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) assisted double-resonance optical pumping (DROP) spectra have been demonstrated via transmission enhancement of the locked 852-nm probe laser. The EIT-assisted DROP spectra are employed to study the hyperfine splitting intervals for the Cs 7D5/2 excited state with a room-temperature cesium atomic vapor cell, and the radio-frequency modulation sideband of a waveguide-type electro-optic phase modulator(EOPM) is introduced for frequency calibration to improve the accuracy of frequency interval measurement. The existence of EIT makes the DROP spectral linewidth much narrower, and it is very helpful to improve the spectroscopic resolution significantly.

We find that the Efimov correlation can be greatly enhanced by increasing the mass ratio between the bosons and the impurity, which results in visible signatures in the rf spectrum of the polaron. Using a diagrammatic approach up to the third-order virial expansion, we show how the mass imbalance and the enhanced three-body effect modify the line shape and the width of the polaron spectrum. Moreover, we study the effect of a finite boson-boson interaction to the spectrum. Taking the realistic system of Li impurities immersed in Cs bosons with a positive Cs-Cs scattering length, we find a visible Efimov branch, which is associated with the second lowest Efimov trimer, in the polaron spectrum. In particular, by adjusting the boson density the Efimov branch can greatly hybridize with the attractive polaron branch leading to the spectrum broadening near their avoided level crossing. Our results can be directly probed in the cold atoms experiments of Li-Cs and Li-Rb Bose polarons."

The interested party cannot design a new game, cannot enforce agents' behavior, cannot enforce payments by the agents, and cannot prohibit strategies available to the agents. However, he can influence the outcome of the game by committing to non-negative monetary transfers for the different strategy profiles that may be selected by the agents. The interested party assumes that agents are rational in the commonly agreed sense that they do not use dominated strategies. Hence, a certain subset of outcomes is implemented in a given game if by adding non-negative payments, rational players will necessarily produce an outcome in this subset. Obviously, by making sufficiently big payments one can implement any desirable outcome. The question is what is the cost of implementation? In this paper we introduce the notion of k-implementation of a desired set of strategy profiles, where k stands for the amount of payment that need to be actually made in order to implement desirable outcomes. A major point in k-implementation is that monetary offers need not necessarily materialize when following desired behaviors. We define and study k-implementation in the contexts of games with complete and incomplete information. In the latter case we mainly focus on the VCG games. Our setting is later extended to deal with mixed strategies using correlation devices. Together, the paper introduces and studies the implementation of desirable outcomes by a reliable party who cannot modify game rules (i.e. provide protocols), complementing previous work in mechanism design, while making it more applicable to many realistic CS settings."

The spectrum features global H charges, vortices carrying flux labeled by the elements of H and dyonic combinations. Due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect these particles exhibit toplogical interactions. The remnant of the U(1)^k CS term in the discrete H gauge theory describing the effective long distance physics of such a model is shown to be a 3-cocycle for H summarizing the nontrivial topological interactions cast upon the magnetic vortices by the U(1)^k CS term. It is noted that there are in general three types of 3-cocycles for a finite abelian gauge group H: one type describes topological interactions among vortices carrying flux w.r.t. the same cyclic group in the direct product H, another type gives rise to topological interactions between vortices carrying flux w.r.t. two different cyclic factors of H and a third type leading to topological interactions between vortices carrying flux w.r.t. three different cyclic factors. Among other things, it is demonstrated that only the first two types can be obtained from a spontaneously broken U(1)^k CS theory. The 3-cocycles that can not be reached in this way turn out to be the most interesting. They render the theory nonabelian and in general lead to dualities with planar theories with a nonabelian finite gauge group. In particular, the CS theory with finite gauge group H = Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 defined by such a 3-cocycle is shown to be dual to the planar discrete D_4 gauge theory with D_4 the dihedral group of order 8."

    "summary": "We present a way to transfer maximally- or partially-entangled states of n single-photon-state (SPS) qubits onto n coherent-state (CS) qubits, by employing 2n microwave cavities coupled to a superconducting flux qutrit. The two logic states of a SPS qubit here are represented by the vacuum state and the single-photon state of a cavity, while the two logic states of a CS qubit are encoded with two coherent states of a cavity. Because of using only one superconducting qutrit as the coupler, the circuit architecture is significantly simplified. The operation time for the state transfer does not increase with the increasing of the number of qubits. When the dissipation of the system is negligible, the quantum state can be transferred in a deterministic way since no measurement is required. Furthermore, the higher-energy intermediate level of the coupler qutrit is not excited during the entire operation and thus decoherence from the qutrit is greatly suppressed. As a specific example, we numerically demonstrate that the high-fidelity transfer of a Bell state of two SPS qubits onto two CS qubits is achievable within the present-day circuit QED technology. Finally, it is worthy to note that when the dissipation is negligible, entangled states of n CS qubits can be transferred back onto n SPS qubits by performing reverse operations. This proposal is quite general and can be extended to accomplish the same task, by employing a natural or artificial atom to couple 2n microwave or optical cavities."

    "summary": "This paper examines the mode choice behaviour of people who may act as occasional couriers to provide crowd-shipping (CS) deliveries. Given its recent increase in popularity, online grocery services have become the main market for crowd-shipping deliveries' provider. The study included a behavioural survey, PTV Visum simulations and discrete choice behaviour modelling based on random utility maximization theory. Mode choice behaviour was examined by considering the gender heterogeneity of the occasional couriers in a multimodal urban transport network. The behavioural dataset was collected in the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine, at the beginning of 2021. The results indicated that women were willing to provide CS service with 8% less remuneration than men. Women were also more likely to make 10% longer detours by car and metro than men, while male couriers were willing to implement 25% longer detours when travelling by bike or walking. Considering the integration of CS detours into the couriers' routine trip chains, women couriers were more likely to attach the CS trip to the work-shopping trip chain whilst men would use the home-home evening time trip chain. The estimated marginal probability effect indicated a higher detour time sensitivity with respect to expected profit and the relative detour costs of the couriers."

    "title": "On the self-sustained nature of large-scale motions in turbulent Couette flow",
    "summary": "Large-scale motions in wall-bounded turbulent flows are frequently interpreted as resulting from an aggregation process of smaller-scale structures. Here, we explore the alternative possibility that such large-scale motions are themselves self-sustained and do not draw their energy from smaller-scale turbulent motions activated in buffer layers. To this end, it is first shown that large-scale motions in turbulent Couette flow at Re=2150 self-sustain even when active processes at smaller scales are artificially quenched by increasing the Smagorinsky constant Cs in large eddy simulations. These results are in agreement with earlier results on pressure driven turbulent channels. We further investigate the nature of the large-scale coherent motions by computing upper and lower-branch nonlinear steady solutions of the filtered (LES) equations with a Newton-Krylov solver,and find that they are connected by a saddle-node bifurcation at large values of Cs. Upper branch solutions for the filtered large scale motions are computed for Reynolds numbers up to Re=2187 using specific paths in the Re-Cs parameter plane and compared to large-scale coherent motions. Continuation to Cs = 0 reveals that these large-scale steady solutions of the filtered equations are connected to the Nagata-Clever-Busse-Waleffe branch of steady solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations. In contrast, we find it impossible to connect the latter to buffer layer motions through a continuation to higher Reynolds numbers in minimal flow units."

The partition functions of such theories can be written as a function of modular transformation matrices summed over different integrable representations of affine Lie algebra associated with boundary Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model. Using properties of modular transform matrices we express the partition functions of these theories as a unitary matrix model. We show that, the eigenvalues of unitary matrices are discrete and proportional to hook lengths of the corresponding integrable Young diagram. As a result, in the large limit, the eigenvalue density develops an upper cap. We consider CS theory on coupled with fundamental matters and express the partition functions in terms of modular transformation matrices. Solving this model at large we find the dominant integrable representations and show how large representations are related to each other by transposition of Young diagrams as a result of level rank duality. Next we consider CS theory on and observed that in Seifert framing the dominant representation is no longer an integrable representation after a critical value of 't Hooft coupling. We also show that CS on admits multiple (two-gap phase) large phases with the same free energy."

    "summary": "Geometry of circumstellar (CS) medium around supernovae (SNe) provides important diagnostics to understand the nature of their progenitors. In this paper, properties of CS dust around SN 2012dn, a super-Chandrasekhar candidate Type Ia supernova (SC-SN), have been studied through detailed three dimensional radiation transfer simulations. With the detected near-infrared excess from SN 2012dn, we show that it has a disk-like dusty CS environment whose mass is roughly consistent with a branch of an accreting white dwarf system (the single degenerate scenario). We show that a similar system should produce polarization signals up to \\% in the band, depending on the viewing direction if polarimetric observation is performed. We predict that the maximum polarization is reached around days after the -band maximum. We show that the temporal and wavelength dependence of the polarization signals, together with other unique features, can be easily distinguished from the interstellar polarization and intrinsic SN polarization. Indeed, the small polarization degree observed for normal Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) can constrain a parameter space in the CS dust mass and distribution. We thus encourage multi-band polarimetric observations for SNe Ia, especially for outliers including SC-SNe for which some arguments for the single degenerate scenario exist but the polarization data are very rare so far."

    "summary": "In three dimensions, every known N=4 supermultiplet has an off-shell completion. However, there is no off-shell N=4 formulation for the known extended superconformal Chern-Simons (CS) theories with eight and more supercharges. To achieve a better understanding of this issue, we provide N=4 superfield realisations for the equations of motion which correspond to various N=4 and N=6 superconformal CS theories, including the Gaiotto-Witten theory and the ABJM theory. These superfield realisations demonstrate that the superconformal CS theories with N>3 (except for the Gaiotto-Witten theory) require a reducible long N=4 vector multiplet, from which the standard left and right N=4 vector multiplets are obtained by constraining the field strength to be either self-dual or anti self-dual. Such a long multiplet naturally originates upon reduction of any off-shell N>4 vector multiplet to N=4 superspace. For the long N=4 vector multiplet we develop a prepotential formulation. It makes use of two prepotentials being subject to the constraint which defines the so-called hybrid projective multiplets introduced in the framework of N=4 supergravity-matter systems in arXiv:1101.4013. We also couple N=4 superconformal CS theories to N=4 conformal supergravity."

We assume that all source signals share a common sparse representation basis. The approach combines classical Compressive Sensing (CS) theory with a linear mixing model. It allows the mixtures to be sampled independently of each other. If samples are acquired in the time domain, this means that the sensors need not be synchronized. Since Blind Source Separation (BSS) from a linear mixture is only possible up to permutation and scaling, factoring out these ambiguities leads to a minimization problem on the so-called oblique manifold. We develop a geometric conjugate subgradient method that scales to large systems for solving the problem. Numerical results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed algorithm compared to several state of the art methods."

For general supervised deep learning classification algorithms, the pixel-by-pixel algorithm achieves precise yet inefficient classification with a small number of labeled pixels, whereas the pixel mapping algorithm achieves efficient yet edge-rough classification with more prior labels required. To take efficiency, accuracy and prior labels into account, we propose a novel pixel-refining parallel mapping network in the complex domain named CRPM-Net and the corresponding training algorithm for PolSAR image classification. CRPM-Net consists of two parallel sub-networks: a) A transfer dilated convolution mapping network in the complex domain (C-Dilated CNN) activated by a complex cross-convolution neural network (Cs-CNN), which is aiming at precise localization, high efficiency and the full use of phase information; b) A complex domain encoder-decoder network connected parallelly with C-Dilated CNN, which is to extract more contextual semantic features. Finally, we design a two-step algorithm to train the Cs-CNN and CRPM-Net with a small number of labeled pixels for higher accuracy by refining misclassified labeled pixels. We verify the proposed method on AIRSAR and E-SAR datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that CRPM-Net achieves the best classification results and substantially outperforms some latest state-of-the-art approaches in both efficiency and accuracy for PolSAR image classification.

    "summary": "We initiate a formal study of logical inferences in context of the measure problem in cosmology or what we call cosmic logic. We describe a simple computational model of cosmic logic suitable for analysis of, for example, discretized cosmological systems. The construction is based on a particular model of computation, developed by Alan Turing, with cosmic observers (CO), cosmic measures (CM) and cosmic symmetries (CS) described by Turing machines. CO machines always start with a blank tape and CM machines take CO's Turing number (also known as description number or G \\\" o del number) as input and output the corresponding probability. Similarly, CS machines take CO's Turing number as input, but output either one if the CO machines are in the same equivalence class or zero otherwise. We argue that CS machines are more fundamental than CM machines and, thus, should be used as building blocks in constructing CM machines. We prove the non-computability of a CS machine which discriminates between two classes of CO machines: mortal that halts in finite time and immortal that runs forever. In context of eternal inflation this result implies that it is impossible to construct CM machines to compute probabilities on the set of all CO machines using cut-off prescriptions. The cut-off measures can still be used if the set is reduced to include only machines which halt after a finite and predetermined number of steps."

The protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are the birthplace of planets and its distinctive environment provides an intriguing platform for investigating models of sulfur chemistry. We analyzed the ALMA observations of CS 7-6 transitions in the HD 163296 disk and perform astrochemical modeling to explore its sulfur chemistry. We simulated the distribution of sulfur-containing molecules and compared it with observationally deduced fractional column densities. We have found that the simulated column density of CS is consistent with the observationally deduced fractional column densities, while the simulated column density of C S is lower than the observationally deduced upper limits on column densities. This results indicate that we have a good understanding of the chemical properties of CS and C S in the disk. We also investigated the influence of the C/O ratio on sulfur-containing molecules and found that the column densities of SO, SO , and H S near the central star are dependent on the C/O ratio. Additionally, we found that the [CS]/ [SO] ratio can serve as a promising indicator of the disk's C/O ratio in the HD 163296. Overall, the disk of HD 163296 provides a favorable environment for the detection of sulfur-containing molecules."

    "title": "ISM chemistry in metal rich environments: molecular tracers of metallicity",

We selected a sample of metal rich spiral and star bursting objects from the literature, and present here new data for a sample of early-type galaxies (ETGs). We conducted the first survey of CS and methanol emission in ETGs, detecting 7 objects in CS, and 5 in methanol emission. We find evidence to support the hypothesis that CS is a better tracer of dense star-forming gas than HCN. We suggest that the methanol emission in these sources is driven by dust mantle destruction due to ionisation from high mass star formation, but cannot rule out shocks dominating in some sources. The derived source averaged CS/methanol column densities and rotation temperatures are similar to those found in normal spiral and starburst galaxies, suggesting dense clouds are little affected by the differences between galaxy types. Finally we used the total column density ratios for our galaxy samples to show for the first time that some molecular tracers do seem to show systematic variations that appear to correlate with metallicity, and that these variations roughly match those predicted by chemical models. Using this fact, the chemical models of Bayet et al. (2012b), and assumptions about the optical depth we are able to roughly predict the metallicity of our spiral and ETG sample, with a scatter of ~0.3 dex. We provide the community with linear approximations to the relationship between the HCN and CS column density ratio and metallicity. Further study will clearly be required to determine if this, or any, molecular tracer can be used to robustly determine gas-phase metallically, but that a relationship exists at all suggests that in the future it may be possible to calibrate a metallicity indicator for the molecular interstellar medium (abridged)."

Of particular importance in the past few decades, is the incorporation of sparsity based priors, in particular priors, into linear inverse problems, which led to the flowering of fields of compressive sensing (CS) and sparsity based signal processing. More recently, methods based on a Compound Gaussian (CG) prior have been investigated and demonstrate improved results over CS in practice. This paper is the first attempt to identify and elucidate the fundamental structures underlying the success of CG methods by studying CG in the context of a broader framework of generalized-sparsity-based-inference. After defining our notion of generalized sparsity we introduce a weak null space property and proceed to generalize two well-known methods in CS, basis pursuit and iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS). We show how a subset of CG-induced regularizers fits into this framework."

    "summary": "This paper presents a wireless neural recording system featuring energy-efficient data compression and encryption. An ultra-high efficiency is achieved by leveraging compressed sensing (CS) for simultaneous data compression and encryption. CS enables sub-Nyquist sampling of neural signals by taking advantage of its intrinsic sparsity. It simultaneously encrypts the data with the sampling matrix being the cryptographic key. To share the key over an insecure wireless channel, we implement an elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) based key exchanging protocol. The CS operation is executed in a custom-designed IC fabricated in 180nm CMOS technology. Mixed-signal circuits are designed to optimize the power efficiency of the matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) of the CS operation. The ECC algorithm is implemented in a low-power Cortex-M0 microcontroller (MCU). To be protected from timing and power analysis attacks, the implementation avoids possible data-dependent branches and also employs a randomized ECC initialization. At a compression ratio of 8x, the average correlated coefficient between the reconstructed signals and the uncompressed signals is 0.973, while the ciphertext-only attacks (CoA) achieve no better than 0.054 over 200,000 attacks. The prototype achieves a 35x power saving compared with conventional implementation in low-power MCUs. This work demonstrates a promising solution for future chronic neural recording systems with requirements in high energy efficiency and security."

    "summary": "Cold spray (CS) has emerged as an important additive manufacturing technology over the past decade. This study investigates the effect of oxide layers on the CS process, focusing on the deformation behavior of copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) particles upon collision with a matching substrate. Using a peridynamics-based approach, we examine the effects of oxide thickness, particle size, and particle/substrate material on material deformation and oxide fracture processes. Our results show that thicker oxide films restrict particle deformation, delay oxide discontinuities and material jetting, and increase the critical velocity required for metal to metal contact. Larger particles, despite uniform deformation across sizes, require lower velocities to initiate jetting and oxide separation because of their higher kinetic energy, leading to metallurgical bonding at lower velocities. Soft to soft impacts induce oxide film cracking at lower velocities, resulting in larger interface areas and more oxide-free contact zones, thereby reducing the critical velocity. Furthermore, the volume of residual oxide has a power-law relationship with the particle size, indicating that the oxide-cleaning ability of the particles affects the critical velocity. This study highlights the importance of oxide deformation and fracture during CS processes and provides valuable insights into the breakage and removal of oxides and subsequent metallic bond formation. These findings offer beneficial new knowledge for the rational design and optimization of CS processes."

    "summary": "Small Object Detection (SOD) poses significant challenges due to limited information and the model's low class prediction score. While Transformer-based detectors have shown promising performance, their potential for SOD remains largely unexplored. In typical DETR-like frameworks, the CNN backbone network, specialized in aggregating local information, struggles to capture the necessary contextual information for SOD. The multiple attention layers in the Transformer Encoder face difficulties in effectively attending to small objects and can also lead to blurring of features. Furthermore, the model's lower class prediction score of small objects compared to large objects further increases the difficulty of SOD. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach called Cross-DINO. This approach incorporates the deep MLP network to aggregate initial feature representations with both short and long range information for SOD. Then, a new Cross Coding Twice Module (CCTM) is applied to integrate these initial representations to the Transformer Encoder feature, enhancing the details of small objects. Additionally, we introduce a new kind of soft label named Category-Size (CS), integrating the Category and Size of objects. By treating CS as new ground truth, we propose a new loss function called Boost Loss to improve the class prediction score of the model. Extensive experimental results on COCO, WiderPerson, VisDrone, AI-TOD, and SODA-D datasets demonstrate that Cross-DINO efficiently improves the performance of DETR-like models on SOD. Specifically, our model achieves 36.4% APs on COCO for SOD with only 45M parameters, outperforming the DINO by +4.4% APS (36.4% vs. 32.0%) with fewer parameters and FLOPs, under 12 epochs training setting.

Although there have been extensive studies on structural and electronic properties of inorganic halide perovskites, the investigation on their thermodynamic stability is lack. Thus, we investigate the effect of substituting Rb for Cs in CsPbI3 on the chemical decomposition and thermodynamic stability using first-principles thermodynamics. By calculating the formation energies of solid solutions Cs Rb PbI3 from their ingredients Cs Rb I and PbI2 , we find that the best match between efficiency and stability can be achieved at the Rb content 0.7. The calculated Helmholtz free energy of solid solutions indicates that Cs Rb PbI3 has a good thermodynamic stability at room temperature due to a good miscibility of CsPbI3 and RbPbI3 . Through lattice-dynamics calculations, we further highlight that RbPbI3 never stabilize in cubic phase at any temperature and pressure due to the chemical decomposition into its ingredients RbI and PbI2 , while CsPbI3 can be stabilized in the cubic phase at the temperature range of 0 600 K and the pressure range of 0 4 GPa.

    "summary": "Functional logic programming (FLP) languages use non-terminating and non-confluent constructor systems (CS's) as programs in order to define non-strict non-determi-nistic functions. Two semantic alternatives have been usually considered for parameter passing with this kind of functions: call-time choice and run-time choice. While the former is the standard choice of modern FLP languages, the latter lacks some properties---mainly compositionality---that have prevented its use in practical FLP systems. Traditionally it has been considered that call-time choice induces a singular denotational semantics, while run-time choice induces a plural semantics. We have discovered that this latter identification is wrong when pattern matching is involved, and thus we propose two novel compositional plural semantics for CS's that are different from run-time choice. We study the basic properties of our plural semantics---compositionality, polarity, monotonicity for substitutions, and a restricted form of the bubbling property for constructor systems---and the relation between them and to previous proposals, concluding that these semantics form a hierarchy in the sense of set inclusion of the set of computed values. We have also identified a class of programs characterized by a syntactic criterion for which the proposed plural semantics behave the same, and a program transformation that can be used to simulate one of them by term rewriting. At the practical level, we study how to use the expressive capabilities of these semantics for improving the declarative flavour of programs. We also propose a language which combines call-time choice and our plural semantics, that we have implemented in Maude. The resulting interpreter is employed to test several significant examples showing the capabilities of the combined semantics. To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)"

Methods: A residual U-net and our U-net M were used to generate the high resolution x-f space estimate for k-t SENSE regularisation prior. The networks were judged on their ability to generalise to real undersampled data. The in-vivo validation was done on 20 real-time 18x prospectively undersmapled GASperturbed PCMR data. The ML aided k-t SENSE reconstruction results were compared against the free-breathing Cartesian retrospectively gated sequence and the compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction of the same data. Results: In general, the ML aided k-t SENSE generated flow curves that were visually sharper than those produced using CS. In two exceptional cases, U-net M predictions exhibited blurring which propagated to the extracted velocity curves. However, there were no statistical differences in the measured peak velocities and stroke volumes between the tested methods. The ML aided k-t SENSE was estimated to be ~3.6x faster in processing than CS. Conclusion: The ML aided k-t SENSE reconstruction enables artefact suppression on a par with CS with no significant differences in quantitative measures. The timing results suggest the on-line implementation could deliver a substantial increase in clinical throughput."

The methodology allows achieving a completely non-destructive and time-lapse characterization of the spatial-temporal patterns of both the cracks and the ASR products. While Cs addition slightly accelerated the ASR kinetics, the crack pat-terns, with and without Cs addition, were statistically equivalent. Cracks with ASR products appeared first in the aggregates, close to the interface with the cement paste. They propagated afterwards towards the aggregates interior. Some products were then extruded for several mm into air voids and cracks in the cement paste. This process suggests that, in the early stage, the ASR products may be a low-viscosity gel that can flow away from the source aggregate and may settle later elsewhere as a rigid phase, upon calcium uptake."

    "title": "A New Sparsification and Reconstruction Strategy for Compressed Sensing Photoacoustic Tomography",
    "summary": "Compressed sensing (CS) is a promising approach to reduce the number of measurements in photoacoustic tomography (PAT) while preserving high spatial resolution. This allows to increase the measurement speed and to reduce system costs. Instead of collecting point-wise measurements, in CS one uses various combinations of pressure values at different sensor locations. Sparsity is the main condition allowing to recover the photoacoustic (PA) source from compressive measurements. In this paper we introduce a new concept enabling sparse recovery in CS PAT. Our approach is based on the fact that the second time derivative applied to the measured pressure data corresponds to the application of the Laplacian to the original PA source. As typical PA sources consist of smooth parts and singularities along interfaces the Laplacian of the source is sparse (or at least compressible). To efficiently exploit the induced sparsity we develop a reconstruction framework to jointly recover the initial and the modified sparse source. Reconstruction results with simulated as well as experimental data are given."

    "title": "Sensitivity Comparison of Rydberg Atom-Based Radio-Frequency Electric Field Detection: Ionization Current Versus Optical Readout",
    "summary": "We investigate a technique for detecting radio-frequency (RF) electric fields in a Cesium (Cs) vapor cell at room temperature by collecting charge from ionized Rydberg atoms and compare its performance with the established method of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). By applying a known RF field, we measure the response from both the electrical (ionization current-based) and optical (EIT-based) readouts. The ionization current-based method yields a sensitivity of 22~ Vm Hz , while the EIT-based method achieves 3.7~ Vm Hz . The sensitivity of the ionization current-based method is limited by thermal noise arising from a 2.2~k resistance between the collection electrodes, attributed to a thin Cs film on the inner surfaces of the vapor cell. Controlling or eliminating the Cs layer can significantly improve the sensitivity of this ionization approach."

    "title": "The scalarised Schwarzschild-NUT spacetime",
    "summary": "It has recently been suggested that vacuum black holes of General Relativity (GR) can become spontaneously scalarised when appropriate non-minimal couplings to curvature invariants are considered. These models circumvent the standard black hole no scalar hair theorems of GR, allowing both the standard GR solutions and new scalarised ( hairy) solutions, which in some cases are thermodynamically preferred. Up to now, however, only (static and spherically symmetric) scalarised Schwarzschild solutions have been considered. It would be desirable to take into account the effect of rotation; however, the higher curvature invariants introduce a considerable challenge in obtaining the corresponding scalarised rotating black holes. As a toy model for rotation, we present here the scalarised generalisation of the Schwarzschild-NUT solution, taking either the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) or the Chern-Simons (CS) curvature invariant. The NUT charge endows spacetime with \"rotation\", but the angular dependence of the corresponding scalarised solutions factorises, leading to a considerable technical simplification. For GB, but not for CS, scalarisation occurs for . This basic difference leads to a distinct space of solutions in the CS case, in particular exhibiting a double branch structure. In the GB case, increasing the horizon area demands a stronger non-minimal coupling for scalarisation; in the CS case, due to the double branch structure, both this and the opposite trend are found. We briefly comment also on the scalarised Reissner-Nordström-NUT solutions."

    "title": "All Data Inclusive, Deep Learning Models to Predict Critical Events in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III Database (MIMIC III)",
    "summary": "Intensive care clinicians need reliable clinical practice tools to preempt unexpected critical events that might harm their patients in intensive care units (ICU), to pre-plan timely interventions, and to keep the patient's family well informed. The conventional statistical models are built by curating only a limited number of key variables, which means a vast unknown amount of potentially precious data remains unused. Deep learning models (DLMs) can be leveraged to learn from large complex datasets and construct predictive clinical tools. This retrospective study was performed using 42,818 hospital admissions involving 35,348 patients, which is a subset of the MIMIC-III dataset. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques were applied to build DLMs to predict in-hospital mortality (IHM) and length of stay >=7 days (LOS). Over 75 million events across multiple data sources were processed, resulting in over 355 million tokens. DLMs for predicting IHM using data from all sources (AS) and chart data (CS) achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.9178 and 0.9029, respectively, and PR-AUC of 0.6251 and 0.5701, respectively. DLMs for predicting LOS using AS and CS achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.8806 and 0.8642, respectively, and PR-AUC of 0.6821 and 0.6575, respectively. The observed AUC-ROC difference between models was found to be significant for both IHM and LOS at p=0.05. The observed PR-AUC difference between the models was found to be significant for IHM and statistically insignificant for LOS at p=0.05. In this study, deep learning models were constructed using data combined from a variety of sources in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) such as chart data, input and output events, laboratory values, microbiology events, procedures, notes, and prescriptions. It is possible to predict in-hospital mortality with much better confidence and higher reliability from models built using all sources of data."

    "title": "A high order cell-centered semi-Lagrangian scheme for multi-dimensional kinetic simulations of neutral gas flows",
    "summary": "The term `Convected Scheme' (CS) refers to a family of algorithms, most usually applied to the solution of Boltzmann's equation, which uses a method of characteristics in an integral form to project an initial cell forward to a group of final cells. As such the CS is a `forward-trajectory' semi-Lagrangian scheme. For multi-dimensional simulations of neutral gas flows, the cell-centered version of this semi-Lagrangian (CCSL) scheme has advantages over other options due to its implementation simplicity, low memory requirements, and easier treatment of boundary conditions. The main drawback of the CCSL-CS to date has been its high numerical diffusion in physical space, because of the 2 order remapping that takes place at the end of each time step. By means of a Modified Equation Analysis, it is shown that a high order estimate of the remapping error can be obtained a priori, and a small correction to the final position of the cells can be applied upon remapping, in order to achieve full compensation of this error. The resulting scheme is 4 order accurate in space while retaining the desirable properties of the CS: it is conservative and positivity-preserving, and the overall algorithm complexity is not appreciably increased. Two monotone (i.e. non-oscillating) versions of the fourth order CCSL-CS are also presented: one uses a common flux-limiter approach; the other uses a non-polynomial reconstruction to evaluate the derivatives of the density function. The method is illustrated in simple one- and two-dimensional examples, and a fully 3D solution of the Boltzmann equation describing expansion of a gas into vacuum through a cylindrical tube."

We present a generic approach to constructing a frequentist CS using Bayesian tools, based on the fact that the ratio of a prior to the posterior at the ground truth is a martingale. We then present Hoeffding- and empirical-Bernstein-type time-uniform CSs and fixed-time confidence intervals for sampling WoR, which improve on previous bounds in the literature and explicitly quantify the benefit of WoR sampling."

    "summary": "Most existing classification methods aim to minimize the overall misclassification error rate. However, in applications such as loan default prediction, different types of errors can have varying consequences. To address this asymmetry issue, two popular paradigms have been developed: the Neyman-Pearson (NP) paradigm and the cost-sensitive (CS) paradigm. Previous studies on the NP paradigm have primarily focused on the binary case, while the multi-class NP problem poses a greater challenge due to its unknown feasibility. In this work, we tackle the multi-class NP problem by establishing a connection with the CS problem via strong duality and propose two algorithms. We extend the concept of NP oracle inequalities, crucial in binary classifications, to NP oracle properties in the multi-class context. Our algorithms satisfy these NP oracle properties under certain conditions. Furthermore, we develop practical algorithms to assess the feasibility and strong duality in multi-class NP problems, which can offer practitioners the landscape of a multi-class NP problem with various target error levels. Simulations and real data studies validate the effectiveness of our algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first study to address the multi-class NP problem with theoretical guarantees. The proposed algorithms have been implemented in the R package npcs , which is available on CRAN."

In particular, for the first time in the literature, we establish the laws of McLeish distribution and therefrom derive the laws of the sum of McLeish distributions by obtaining closed-form expressions for their PDF, CDF, complementary CDF (C DF), MGF and higher-order moments. Further, for certain problems related to the envelope of complex random signals, we extend McLeish distribution to complex McLeish distribution and thereby propose circularly/elliptically symmetric (CS/ES) complex McLeish distributions with closed-form PDF, CDF, MGF and higher-order moments. For generalization of one-dimensional distribution to multi-dimensional distribution, we develop and propose both multivariate McLeish distribution and multivariate complex CS/ES (CCS/CES) McLeish distribution with analytically tractable and closed-form PDF, CDF, C DF and MGF. In addition to the proposed McLeish distribution framework and for its practical illustration, we theoretically investigate and prove the existence of McLeish distribution as additive noise in communication systems. Accordingly, we introduce additive white McLeish noise (AWMN) channels. For coherent/non-coherent signaling over AWMN channels, we propose novel expressions for MAP and ML symbol decisions and thereby obtain closed-form expressions for both BER of binary modulation schemes and SER of various M-ary modulation schemes. Further, we verify the validity and accuracy of our novel BER/SER expressions with some selected numerical examples and some computer-based simulations."

Hen 2-108 is a poorly known planetary nebula with a slight elliptical morphology and a peculiar central star (CS), which has defied classification. In this work, we present the first detailed integral field spectroscopic study of the planetary nebula Hen 2-108 and its CS. We provide spatially resolved flux maps for important emission lines, as well as diagnostic maps of extinction and electronic density and temperature. Physical conditions and chemical abundances were also calculated from the integrated spectrum. The analysis was also performed with the code satellite which uses a distinct strategy to evaluate physical and chemical properties. Both satellite and traditional procedure give consistent results, showing some variation in physical and chemical properties. We detect and measure a number of faint heavy element recombination lines from which we find a significant abundance discrepancy factor for O/H, and possibly for N/H. Pseudo 3D photoionization models were used to assist in the interpretation with results supporting the low-ionisation nature of this nebula, indicating a CS with Teff = 40 kK and a shell structure. The spectrum of the CS has been analysed with a detailed model for expanding atmospheres to infer stellar parameters, finding that it is a [Of/WN8] type with T* = 41.5 kK, making it a new addition to a small set (~20) of rare objects."

SVC minimizes the voltage deviation of the load buses while CS deals with the problem of the limited bandwidth capacity of the communication channel by reducing the size of massive data output from phasor measurement unit (PMU) based monitoring system. The proposed strategy further incorporates the application of a Morphological Median Filter (MMF) to reduce noise from the output of the PMUs. To keep the control area secure and protected locally, Mathematical Singular Entropy (MSE) based fault identification approach is utilized for fast discovery of faults in the control area. Simulation results with 27-bus and 486-bus power systems show that CS can reduce the data size up to 1/10th while the MSE based fault identification technique can accurately distinguish between fault and steady state conditions."

The heating depends on the trap frequency which restricts the maximum repetition rate of pulsed excitation. We experimentally verify the heating of a single atom and then demonstrate how to suppress it with an optimized pulsed excitation/cooling method. The typical trap lifetime of single Cs atom is extended from 108 +/- 6 us to 2536 +/- 31 ms, and the corresponding number of excitation increases from ~ 108 to ~ 360000. In applying this faster cooling method, we use the trapped single Cs atom as a triggered single-photon source at an excitation repetition rate of 10 MHz. The second-order intensity correlations of the emitted single photons are characterized by implementing Hanbury Brown and Twiss setup, and clear anti-bunching effect has been observed."

However, Takens' theorem is fragile in the sense that even small imperfections can induce arbitrarily large errors in this attractor representation. We extend Takens' result to establish deterministic, explicit and non-asymptotic sufficient conditions for a delay coordinate map to form a stable embedding in the restricted case of linear dynamical systems and observation functions. Our work is inspired by the field of Compressive Sensing (CS), where results guarantee that low-dimensional signal families can be robustly reconstructed if they are stably embedded by a measurement operator. However, in contrast to typical CS results, i) our sufficient conditions are independent of the size of the ambient state space, and ii) some system and measurement pairs have fundamental limits on the conditioning of the embedding (i.e., how close it is to an isometry), meaning that further measurements beyond some point add no further significant value. We use several simple simulations to explore the conditions of the main results, including the tightness of the bounds and the convergence speed of the stable embedding. We also present an example task of estimating the attractor dimension from time-series data to highlight the value of stable embeddings over traditional Takens' embeddings."

    "summary": "In the past few years, new approaches to radar signal processing have been introduced which allow the radar to perform signal detection and parameter estimation from much fewer measurements than that required by Nyquist sampling. These systems - referred to as sub-Nyquist radars - model the received signal as having finite rate of innovation and employ the Xampling framework to obtain low-rate samples of the signal. Sub-Nyquist radars exploit the fact that the target scene is sparse facilitating the use of compressed sensing (CS) methods in signal recovery. In this chapter, we review several pulse-Doppler radar systems based on these principles. Contrary to other CS-based designs, our formulations directly address the reduced-rate analog sampling in space and time, avoid a prohibitive dictionary size, and are robust to noise and clutter. We begin by introducing temporal sub-Nyquist processing for estimating the target locations using less bandwidth than conventional systems. This paves the way to cognitive radars which share their transmit spectrum with other communication services, thereby providing a robust solution for coexistence in spectrally crowded environments. Next, without impairing Doppler resolution, we reduce the dwell time by transmitting interleaved radar pulses in a scarce manner within a coherent processing interval or \"slow time\". Then, we consider multiple-input-multiple-output array radars and demonstrate spatial sub-Nyquist processing which allows the use of few antenna elements without degradation in angular resolution. Finally, we demonstrate application of sub-Nyquist and cognitive radars to imaging systems such as synthetic aperture radar. For each setting, we present a state-of-the-art hardware prototype designed to demonstrate the real-time feasibility of sub-Nyquist radars."

This recently discovered pre-protostellar core in L1551 appears to be in the early stages of dynamical evolution. Line-of-sight infall velocities of >0.1km/s are needed in the outer regions of L1551 MC to adequately fit the data. This translates to an accretion rate of ~ 1e-6 Msun/yr, uncertain to within a factor of 5 owing to unknown geometry. The observed dynamics are not due to spherically symmetric gravitational collapse and are not consistent with the standard model of low-mass star formation. The widespread, fairly uniform CS line asymmetries are more consistent with planar infall. There is modest evidence for chemical depletion in the radial profiles of CS and C18O suggesting that L1551 MC is also chemically young. The models are not very sensitive to chemical evolution. L1551 MC lies within a quiescent region of L1551 and is evidence for continued star formation in this evolved cloud."

Spectrum sensors equipped with directional antennas should constantly scan the space in order to track emitting sources and discover new activities in the area of interest. In this paper, we propose a new formulation that unifies received-signal-strength (RSS) and direction of arrival (DoA) in a compressive sensing (CS) framework. The underlying CS measurement matrix is a function of beamforming vectors of sensors and is referred to as the propagation matrix. Comparing to the omni-directional antenna case, our employed propagation matrix provides more incoherent projections, an essential factor in the compressive sensing theory. Based on the new formulation, we optimize the antenna beams, enhance spectrum sensing efficiency, track active primary users accurately and monitor spectrum activities in an area of interest. In many practical scenarios there is no fusion center to integrate received data from spectrum sensors. We propose the distributed version of our algorithm for such cases. Experimental results show a significant improvement in source localization accuracy, compared with the scenario when sensors are equipped with omni-directional antennas. Applicability of the proposed framework for dynamic radio cartography is shown. Moreover, comparing the estimated dynamic RF map over time with the ground truth demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method for accurate signal estimation and recovery."

Further, the use of implicit frameworks is preferable over the explicit framework, as it can be easily adapted to deal with low/zero resource languages. Inspired by speaker diarization (SD) literature, three frameworks based on (1) fixed segmentation, (2) change point-based segmentation and (3) E2E are proposed to perform LD. The initial exploration with synthetic TTSF-LD dataset shows, using x-vector as implicit language representation with appropriate analysis window length ( ) can able to achieve at per performance with explicit LD. The best implicit LD performance of in terms of Jaccard error rate (JER) is achieved by using the E2E framework. However, considering the E2E framework the performance of implicit LD degrades to while using with practical Microsoft CS (MSCS) dataset. The difference in performance is mostly due to the distributional difference between the monolingual segment duration of secondary language in the MSCS and TTSF-LD datasets. Moreover, to avoid segment smoothing, the smaller duration of the monolingual segment suggests the use of a small value of .

Therefore, to resolve the issue a self-supervised implicit language representation is proposed in this study. In comparison with the x-vector representation, the proposed representation provides a relative improvement of and achieved a JER of using the E2E framework."

    "title": "The density structure of the L1157 molecular outflow",
    "summary": "We present a multiline CS survey towards the brightest bow-shock B1 in the prototypical chemically active protostellar outflow L1157. We made use of (sub-)mm data obtained in the framework of the Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions (CHESS) and Astrochemical Surveys at IRAM (ASAI) key science programs. We detected C S, C S, C S, and C S emissions, for a total of 18 transitions, with up to 180 K. The unprecedented sensitivity of the survey allows us to carefully analyse the line profiles, revealing high-velocity emission, up to 20 km s with respect to the systemic. The profiles can be well fitted by a combination of two exponential laws that are remarkably similar to what previously found using CO. These components have been related to the cavity walls produced by the 2000 yr B1 shock and the older ( 4000 yr) B2 shock, respectively. The combination of low- and high-excitation CS emission was used to properly sample the different physical components expected in a shocked region. Our CS observations show that this molecule is highlighting the dense, = 1--5 10 cm , cavity walls produced by the episodic outflow in L1157. In addition, the highest excitation (E 130 K) CS lines provide us with the signature of denser (1--5 10 cm ) gas, associated with a molecular reformation zone of a dissociative J-type shock, which is expected to arise where the precessing jet impacting the molecular cavities. The CS fractional abundance increases up to 10 in all the kinematical components. This value is consistent with what previously found for prototypical protostars and it is in agreement with the prediction of the abundances obtained via the chemical code Astrochem."

    "title": "Clock and Orientation-Robust Simultaneous Radio Localization and Mapping at Millimeter Wave Bands",
    "summary": "This paper proposes a radio simultaneous location and mapping (radio-SLAM) scheme based on sparse multipath channel estimation. By leveraging sparse channel estimation schemes at millimeter wave bands, namely high resolution estimates of the multipath angle of arrival (AoA), time difference of arrival (TDoA), and angle of departure (AoD), we develop a radio-SLAM algorithm that operates without any requirements of clock synchronization, receiver orientation knowledge, multiple anchor points, or two-way protocols. Thanks to the AoD information obtained via compressed sensing (CS) of the channel, the proposed scheme can estimate the receiver clock offset and orientation from a single anchor transmission, achieving sub-meter accuracy in a realistic typical channel simulation."

    "summary": "Critical properties of the Calogero-Sutherland model of -type ( -CS model) are studied. Using the asymptotic Bethe-ansatz spectrum of the -CS model, we calculate finite-size corrections in the energy spectrum. Since the -CS model does not possess translational invariance, the finite-size spectrum acquires the contributions coming from ``boundaries''. We show that the low-energy critical behavior of the model is described by boundary conformal field theory. Thus the universality class of the model is identified as a chiral Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid."

    "title": "Deep Manifold Learning for Dynamic MR Imaging",
    "summary": "Purpose: To develop a deep learning method on a nonlinear manifold to explore the temporal redundancy of dynamic signals to reconstruct cardiac MRI data from highly undersampled measurements. Methods: Cardiac MR image reconstruction is modeled as general compressed sensing (CS) based optimization on a low-rank tensor manifold. The nonlinear manifold is designed to characterize the temporal correlation of dynamic signals. Iterative procedures can be obtained by solving the optimization model on the manifold, including gradient calculation, projection of the gradient to tangent space, and retraction of the tangent space to the manifold. The iterative procedures on the manifold are unrolled to a neural network, dubbed as Manifold-Net. The Manifold-Net is trained using in vivo data with a retrospective electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated segmented bSSFP sequence. Results: Experimental results at high accelerations demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain improved reconstruction compared with a compressed sensing (CS) method k-t SLR and two state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods, DC-CNN and CRNN. Conclusion: This work represents the first study unrolling the optimization on manifolds into neural networks. Specifically, the designed low-rank manifold provides a new technical route for applying low-rank priors in dynamic MR imaging."

We discuss some general properties of the algebra and construct four different realizations of the dynamical symmetry algebra of the Calogero model. Using the fact that the minimal algebra of observables is common to the Calogero model and the finite Chern-Simons (CS) matrix model, we extend our analysis to the CS matrix model. We point out the algebraic similarities and distinctions of these models."

Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectra evidence TPP presence in both monomeric and agglomerated forms in the nanocomposites. The nanocomposites demonstrate more pronounced singlet oxygen generation in comparison with free TPP in CS at the same concentration due to intracomplex Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) with 45 % average efficiency."

    "title": "Oscillations in Rapid Fracture",
    "summary": "Experiments of pure tensile fracture in brittle gels reveal a new dynamic oscillatory instability whose onset occurs at a critical velocity, Vc = 0.87 Cs, where Cs is the shear wave speed. Until Vc crack dynamics are well described by linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). These extreme speeds are obtained by suppression of the micro-branching instability, which occurs when sample thicknesses are made comparable to the minimum micro-branch width. The wavelength of these sinusoidal oscillations is independent of the sample dimensions, thereby suggesting that a new intrinsic scale exists that is unrelated to LEFM."

    "title": "Learned D-AMP: Principled Neural Network based Compressive Image Recovery",
    "summary": "Compressive image recovery is a challenging problem that requires fast and accurate algorithms. Recently, neural networks have been applied to this problem with promising results. By exploiting massively parallel GPU processing architectures and oodles of training data, they can run orders of magnitude faster than existing techniques. However, these methods are largely unprincipled black boxes that are difficult to train and often-times specific to a single measurement matrix. It was recently demonstrated that iterative sparse-signal-recovery algorithms can be \"unrolled\" to form interpretable deep networks. Taking inspiration from this work, we develop a novel neural network architecture that mimics the behavior of the denoising-based approximate message passing (D-AMP) algorithm. We call this new network Learned D-AMP (LDAMP). The LDAMP network is easy to train, can be applied to a variety of different measurement matrices, and comes with a state-evolution heuristic that accurately predicts its performance. Most importantly, it outperforms the state-of-the-art BM3D-AMP and NLR-CS algorithms in terms of both accuracy and run time. At high resolutions, and when used with sensing matrices that have fast implementations, LDAMP runs over faster than BM3D-AMP and hundreds of times faster than NLR-CS."

    "title": "Di-Baryon from Instanton in Holographic QCD",
    "summary": "We study the di-baryon in the holographic QCD. The di-baryon is composed of six quarks and bound by the color interaction. In this paper, we adopt the Sakai-Sugimoto (SS) model as the holographic QCD to study the di-baryon. The SS model is formulated in a system of the Type IIA string theory. It is expected that the di-baryon is described by the 2-instanton configuration of the flavor symmetry on D8-branes since the baryon number is identified as the instanton number. We will construct the 't Hooft 2-instanton solution explicitly and use it to discuss the stability of the di-baryon. An effective action of this model has not only the Yang-Mills (YM) action but also the Chern-Simons (CS) action coming from the CS action of probe D8-branes, and the CS action assigns charges associated with the baryon number to each instanton. As a result, we can see that the di-baryon is unstable due to this charge in the SS model."

    "title": "Attention-Based Efficient Breath Sound Removal in Studio Audio Recordings",
    "summary": "In this research, we present an innovative, parameter-efficient model that utilizes the attention U-Net architecture for the automatic detection and eradication of non-speech vocal sounds, specifically breath sounds, in vocal recordings. This task is of paramount importance in the field of sound engineering, despite being relatively under-explored. The conventional manual process for detecting and eliminating these sounds requires significant expertise and is extremely time-intensive. Existing automated detection and removal methods often fall short in terms of efficiency and precision. Our proposed model addresses these limitations by offering a streamlined process and superior accuracy, achieved through the application of advanced deep learning techniques. A unique dataset, derived from Device and Produced Speech (DAPS), was employed for this purpose. The training phase of the model emphasizes a log spectrogram and integrates an early stopping mechanism to prevent overfitting. Our model not only conserves precious time for sound engineers but also enhances the quality and consistency of audio production. This constitutes a significant breakthrough, as evidenced by its comparative efficiency, necessitating only 1.9M parameters and a training duration of 3.2 hours - markedly less than the top-performing models in this domain. The model is capable of generating identical outputs as previous models with drastically improved precision, making it an optimal choice."

    "title": "ATP-Net: An Attention-based Ternary Projection Network For Compressed Sensing",
    "summary": "Compressed Sensing (CS) theory simultaneously realizes the signal sampling and compression process, and can use fewer observations to achieve accurate signal recovery, providing a solution for better and faster transmission of massive data. In this paper, a ternary sampling matrix-based method with attention mechanism is proposed with the purpose to solve the problem that the CS sampling matrices in most cases are random matrices, which are irrelative to the sampled signal and need a large storage space. The proposed method consists of three components, i.e., ternary sampling, initial reconstruction and deep reconstruction, with the emphasis on the ternary sampling. The main idea of the ternary method (-1, 0, +1) is to introduce the attention mechanism to evaluate the importance of parameters at the sampling layer after the sampling matrix is binarized (-1, +1), followed by pruning weight of parameters, whose importance is below a predefined threshold, to achieve ternarization. Furthermore, a compressed sensing algorithm especially for image reconstruction is implemented, on the basis of the ternary sampling matrix, which is called ATP-Net, i.e., Attention-based ternary projection network. Experimental results show that the quality of image reconstruction by means of ATP-Net maintains a satisfactory level with the employment of the ternary sampling matrix, i.e., the average PSNR on Set11 is 30.4 when the sampling rate is 0.25, approximately 6% improvement compared with that of DR2-Net."

    "title": "Multi-Sparse Signal Recovery for Compressive Sensing",
    "summary": "Signal recovery is one of the key techniques of Compressive sensing (CS). It reconstructs the original signal from the linear sub-Nyquist measurements. Classical methods exploit the sparsity in one domain to formulate the L0 norm optimization. Recent investigation shows that some signals are sparse in multiple domains. To further improve the signal reconstruction performance, we can exploit this multi-sparsity to generate a new convex programming model. The latter is formulated with multiple sparsity constraints in multiple domains and the linear measurement fitting constraint. It improves signal recovery performance by additional a priori information. Since some EMG signals exhibit sparsity both in time and frequency domains, we take them as example in numerical experiments. Results show that the newly proposed method achieves better performance for multi-sparse signals."
